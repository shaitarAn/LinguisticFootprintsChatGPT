"This news article discusses the global pattern of personal wealth and how it has changed over the past year. It focuses on two countries in particular, the United States and Japan, which have had contrasting experiences with regards to wealth accumulation.  The United States has seen a fifth successive year of increases in personal wealth. This growth has been driven by a recovery in house prices and a bullish stock market, particularly with regards to the Dow Jones index reaching new highs. As a result, the United States has added $8.1 trillion to global wealth stocks, increasing wealth ownership by 12.7% to $72.1 trillion.  On the other hand, Japan's aggressive monetary policy implemented by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) led to even greater rises in equity prices, up 52% in the year leading up to mid-2013. However, despite this positive development for equities, total household wealth in Japan has actually fallen by $5.8 trillion this year due to several factors. For instance, Japanese equities are much lower compared to international standards and account for less than 10% of household financial wealth. Additionally, these aggressive BOJ policies have resulted in a 22% decrease in the yen-USD exchange rate.  Interestingly, although Japan suffered relatively little during the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2008 – with personal wealth even growing during that period – their total wealth is currently only 1% above its level from back then.  Aside from these two countries' experiences highlighted above; overall economic conditions around the world have generally favored acquiring more personal wealth over this past year.  The article also provides information about other countries where changes in total household wealth exceeded $200 billion - China ($1.4 trillion), Germany ($1.2 trillion), France ($1.ltrillion), Italy , United Kingdom , Spain , Mexico , Sweden , India , Korea and Canada . In addition,the Eurozone countries have recovered over half of the significant wealth loss they experienced a year earlier, due to equity price increases and advantageous euro-dollar movements. The United Kingdom , India and Switzerland also managed to recover a significant portion of their recent losses.  According to the article, the average global household wealth per adult is at an all-time high of $51,600. However,this average masks variations across different countries and regions. The richest nations - mainly found in North America, Western Europe, rich Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern countries - have an average wealth per adult exceeding $100,000. Switzerland leads this list with an average wealth exceeding $500,000 in 2011 which dropped below it in 2012 but reached a new peak value of $513,000 per adult this year.  Australia ($403k), Norway ($380k), Luxembourg ($315K) follow closely behind in second through fourth place respectively from 2012. The United States , Sweden , France , Singapore , Belgium and Denmark also have considerable average wealth per adult ranging from $250k to $300k.  The article goes on to reveal some striking numbers regarding how global wealth is distributed across individuals around the world. It states that an individual needs at least $75,000 in assets to be among the top 10% wealthiest people globally, while belonging to the top percentile requires holdings worth at least$753k or more . In contrast,the bottom half of the world's population owns less than 1% of total worldwide assets; meanwhile,the richest 10% hold around 86% of total global wealth.   Lastly,the author refers readers who'd like further information about total wealth distribution patterns across regions and countries during mid-2013 can refer Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report for that year",explain
"This news article discusses the impact of recent events on the Swiss economy and various industries. It starts by mentioning that public budgets are under pressure due to higher savings, which has affected certain industries. However, the construction industry had a successful year in 2014 due to low interest rates and extensive planning activities.  The article then goes on to discuss the export industry, which picked up pace in 2014 but not as much as expected. In 2015, there was a significant change in monetary policy that led to a sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. This made Swiss products and services more expensive compared to foreign counterparts, leading to losses for some companies.  The stronger franc is expected to have an impact on both the export industry and domestic economy in 2015. The article revises Switzerland's GDP growth forecast from 1.6% to 0.8%. Despite this slowdown, a recession is not expected due to an average exchange rate of just over 1.00 with the euro.  The lifting of the CHF/EUR exchange rate floor was influenced by stagnant global economic recovery and concerns about mass immigration initiatives on bilateral agreements with the EU.  The hospitality industry is likely to be greatly affected by recent events as Switzerland becomes a more expensive vacation destination. This could result in fewer hotel visits by foreign guests and Swiss travelers choosing other countries for their vacations.  Most export sectors will face difficulties due to the strong franc affecting nearly all industries differently depending on factors such as export orientation, margin level, percentage of costs originating in Switzerland, and customers' price sensitivity.  Industries such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemicals/pharmaceuticals manufacturing may experience limited growth or even declines due to exchange-rate effects; however pharmaceuticals and watch manufacturers may be able better cushion these effects by increasing margins.  Retailers will also face challenges as shopping tourism is expected to increase further reducing retail sales compared with last year potentially leading to decreased employment in the industry.  While service industries may have a lower impact from the strong franc this year, telecommunications, hospitals, and other service providers may experience reduced demand due to lower overall economic demand for workers combined with lower immigration rates. However, this effect is not expected to be noticeable until 2016.  IT companies will also see slower growth in sales and employment due to tight budgets under the strong franc; however key trends such as increasing regulation in the financial sector and rapid technological progress will still drive investments in productivity-boosting IT solutions.  The article concludes by mentioning that while economic and exchange-rate fluctuations have short-term impacts on various sectors, long-term factors such as demographic change and advancements in medical technology make healthcare and IT industries noteworthy opportunities.  Overall, the strong franc is expected to dominate discussions across many industries throughout 2015, impacting growth rates, sales figures, employment levels, and prompting adjustments across sectors as they navigate both short-term uncertainties and long-term trends. In addition to discussing the short-term impacts of the strong franc and other recent events, the article also highlights some medium and long-term factors that are shaping various industries in Switzerland.  One significant trend mentioned is demographic change. The aging population in industrialized nations, coupled with advancements in medical technology, is leading to a constant increase in demand for healthcare, nursing care, and support services. This presents opportunities for industries such as pharmaceuticals and medical technology to cater to this growing need.  Another sector with an above-average opportunity-risk profile is IT. The ongoing digitalization of the economy and society is driving demand for IT services. Companies are adapting their systems and processes to keep up with technological progress, resulting in larger order books for the IT industry. Additionally, stricter compliance requirements and increasing regulations are also boosting demand for IT solutions.  The article acknowledges that amidst economic fluctuations and exchange-rate effects in the short term, there are also structural factors at play that have medium- and long-term impacts on industry sectors. It suggests that by creating a medium-term opportunity-risk profile of different Swiss sectors each year, these long-term trends can be identified.  While certain industries may face challenges due to immediate circumstances like exchange rate fluctuations or geopolitical risks related to bilateral agreements with the EU following immigration initiatives; others have opportunities linked to broader trends such as healthcare demands associated with an aging population or increasing use of IT services driven by digitalization.  It's important to note that this news article paints a broad overview rather than delving into specific details about each industry or providing extensive analysis beyond stating expectations based on current economic conditions. However, it gives readers a snapshot of how various sectors are likely to be impacted by recent events while pointing out some underlying factors that will shape their future prospects.  Overall, it suggests that 2015 will be a difficult year for many industries due to the strong franc's impact on exports as well as domestic spending patterns influenced by higher prices. However, industries with opportunities linked to longer-term trends may still find avenues for growth despite the prevailing challenges.",explain
"This news article discusses the current and expected trends in emerging market consumption. The article states that over the next 12 months, the outperformance of emerging market consumption is likely to accelerate for four main reasons.  Firstly, lead indicators suggest a positive momentum in emerging markets, indicating that these markets are performing better compared to developed markets. Secondly, real wages and income growth in emerging economies continue to be higher than those in developed markets. This means that people in emerging economies have more money to spend on goods and services.  Thirdly, China is implementing policies to promote greater domestic consumption. This is significant because China has a large population and increased consumption within the country can drive global economic growth.  Lastly, aging and over-leveraged developed markets are experiencing a downward adjustment to household consumption. This means that consumers in developed countries are reducing their spending due to factors like high debt levels or an aging population.  The article also mentions the results of a survey conducted on consumer sentiment. The survey reveals that consumers are optimistic about their immediate financial outlook with 37% expecting an improvement compared to only 9% anticipating a deterioration.  However, the article notes that these positive trends are not uniform across all emerging economies. The survey highlights differences between countries included in the Consumer Survey. Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia show strong optimism regarding personal finances with percentages ranging from 33% - 66%. On the other hand, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey have more pessimism among consumers regarding their financial prospects.  Comparing this year's survey results with previous years' surveys shows increasing optimism among consumers on average. For example, Brazil has seen an increase from 53% - 63%, while China has gone up from 31% - 39%.  The article also discusses wage expectations within different countries. Brazil shows relatively strong nominal wage expectations followed by Indonesia but Turkey,  Russia  and South Africa have lower wage expectations overall.  Another interesting observation from the survey data is the age composition of income brackets. In many markets, the youngest working-age population has achieved higher income levels compared to older age groups. This trend is seen in China, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. However, in South Africa, the younger age group earns significantly more due to extremely low earnings for older age groups.  The article concludes by acknowledging that these survey results may be influenced by the sample size and demographics of respondents rather than being a reflection of broader trends.  Overall, this news article provides insight into current trends in emerging market consumption and discusses variations within different countries. It highlights factors like wage growth and demographic patterns that impact consumer sentiment and spending behavior in these markets. Continuing from the previous explanation, the news article emphasizes that while there is generally a positive macro view on emerging market consumption, there are disparities within and between different economies. The survey data sheds light on these variations.  In Brazil, for instance, the survey results show strong optimism with 66% of respondents expecting an improvement in their personal finances over the next six months. This reflects a growing positive sentiment among consumers in Brazil. Similarly, China displays an optimistic outlook with 44% of respondents anticipating better financial conditions.  On the other hand, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey stand out as countries where pessimism regarding financial prospects is more prevalent. In South Africa particularly, there is concern about rising unemployment levels and declining household income among lower-income groups. These factors contribute to a relatively depressed consumer sentiment compared to other countries surveyed.  The article draws attention to past parallels between consumer optimism surveys and subsequent events in certain regions. For example, it recalls how in 2010's survey regarding Egypt's financial outlook resulted in a high percentage (38%) of Egyptians expecting a deterioration compared to those anticipating an improvement (12%). This was followed by social unrest that erupted in Egypt during spring 2011. It also mentions recent widespread strikes affecting South Africa since H2 2012 which appear consistent with lower consumer optimism identified by the survey.  When comparing this year's aggregate survey results with previous years', it becomes clear that consumers are generally more optimistic now across several markets such as Brazil and China. This indicates improving confidence in future economic conditions.  Additionally, wage expectations emerge as important determinants of consumer sentiment across various countries surveyed. Brazil leads with strong nominal wage expectations followed closely by Indonesia and Saudi Arabia; however,Turkey,Russia,and South Africa show relatively depressed wage expectations overall.  Another significant finding concerns age demographics within income brackets across different markets.The data indicates that younger working-age populations tend to have higher income levels compared to older age groups. This trend is evident in China, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. However, in South Africa, the higher earnings of the younger group seem to be a reflection of very low earnings for older age groups rather than indicating high incomes.  The article acknowledges that while these survey results provide valuable insights into consumer sentiment and expectations, they also acknowledge limitations such as potential bias due to the sample size and composition of respondents.  To summarize, this news article delves into the current trends in emerging market consumption. It highlights variations within different countries based on consumer sentiment surveys while also touching on factors such as wage growth and demographic patterns that influence consumer behavior within these markets. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and challenges surrounding emerging market consumption trends.",explain
"This news article discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) quantitative easing (QE) program and its potential impact on the Eurozone. QE is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic growth and combat deflation. It involves the purchase of government bonds and other assets from banks, thereby injecting liquidity into the financial system.  The article highlights that the ECB's QE program will involve buying €60 billion worth of assets per month from March 2015 until at least September 2016. This amounts to a total of €1,140 billion, slightly above market expectations. It is estimated that around €40 billion per month will be allocated to sovereign bonds, totaling approximately €760 billion.  The article explains that commercial banks in Northern Europe may have little interest in participating in the program because they can borrow at similar rates in the market. Additionally, weak demand for corporate credit in some Eurozone countries limits their banks' need for ECB loans. The structure of the Eurozone's central banking system and political compromises have made the details of this program fairly complex.  Furthermore, purchases across markets within the Eurozone will be allocated based on each national central bank's capital shares (capital key). For example, Germany’s Bundesbank will buy more bonds than Italy’s Banca d'Italia. Purchases are limited to 25 percent of outstanding debt or 33 percent issuance by a particular issuer within a maturity range of 2-30 years.  Greece's government bonds are excluded from this program due to their insufficient credit quality. Countries under an adjustment program must fulfill specific criteria to qualify for participation.  In addition to bond purchases, interest rates charged on targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) have been reduced by 10 basis points to match the main refinancing rate at 0.05 percent.  There has been discussion surrounding risk-sharing within this QE program; however, it is concluded that other mechanisms are in place to reduce the risk of government default. These mechanisms include the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) acting as a backstop and conditional support programs (OMT) being deemed legal by the European Court of Justice. The TARGET2 system also acts as a key backstop, allowing central banks within Eurozone member states to borrow from each other.  The article argues against claims that QE will not work in the Eurozone and provides counterarguments. It suggests that bond yields in peripheral Eurozone countries could decline even further, reducing overall borrowing costs. It posits that buying government bonds from banks and other investors will incentivize them to invest elsewhere, potentially enhancing bank lending. Additionally, the article suggests that bond purchases will increase asset prices, making it more attractive for companies to raise equity capital and creating positive wealth effects for households. Moreover, expanding the ECB's balance sheet through QE while other central banks have halted their asset purchases is expected to weaken the euro and stimulate Eurozone competitiveness.  The overall impact of this QE program is viewed positively by suggesting it adds another piece to an improving policy framework in the Eurozone. The article notes progress made with fiscal consolidation and highlights efforts made towards financial market integration through launching the European Banking Union.  In conclusion, this news article explains the details of ECB's quantitative easing program, its potential benefits for boosting growth in the Eurozone economy, and discusses various aspects related to its implementation within different countries of Europe's monetary union.

"This news article discusses the expected recovery and growth of several economies in the coming year. The author believes that the United States will recover more rapidly than many people anticipate due to factors such as reducing their debt and becoming more self-sufficient in energy. Additionally, they predict that the United Kingdom may outperform current expectations, as it has a history of swinging further into recession or growth than forecasted.  China is highlighted as a significant player with a growth rate of 7.5 percent, which will contribute significantly to global economic expansion. However, despite some countries growing faster than expected, it is emphasized that this will not result in a boom scenario but rather a steady recovery.  The article acknowledges that it will take years to fully recover from the recent financial crisis and recession due to dealing with existing debt issues and implementing growth-related policies, which can be expensive. It also highlights caution in policy-making since this particular crisis was unparalleled for quite some time.  While there are uncertainties in the world economy, such as potential banking collapses or conflicts in regions like the Middle East, these factors are not deemed substantial enough to derail overall global recovery. Overall, maintaining a steady recovery is seen as healthier than stimulating rapid growth artificially.  The article expresses optimism about China's shift towards sustainable growth patterns through initiatives like expanding domestic demand and increasing wages for its citizens. This development is believed to benevolently impact both China's internal market and provide an expanded market for other countries worldwide.  On matters of military security, there is an assertion that humanity now resides in a safer place compared to decades ago when conflict between dominant powers posed serious intercontinental risks. As globalization continues connecting different nations economically and fostering common interests among major powers like China, America, and the European Union; chances of such conflicts have diminished significantly over time.  In conclusion, this news article presents an optimistic outlook on global economic recovery next year with both positive expectations for certain countries' performances and improved intercontinental relations. It also recognizes potential uncertainties, but overall believes that the world is headed towards a healthier state of the economy. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness of the global economy and how it has led to increased dependence among nations. As countries like the United States, China, and the European Union share common interests in various global matters, conflicts between them are seen as less likely compared to previous decades.  The author uses the example of the improved relationship between America and China today compared to America's relationship with the Soviet Union 30 years ago. This shift is attributed to shared economic interests and a decrease in the risk of serious intercontinental conflict. While certain challenges such as small wars, terrorism, and economic problems still exist, they are not considered on par with historical risks.  Despite this overall positive assessment, uncertainties remain. The possibility of another banking collapse or currency crisis is acknowledged as potential events that could significantly impact global stability. Similarly, conflicts or political instability in regions like the Middle East are mentioned as potential sources of trouble.  In terms of economic growth and recovery from a worldwide perspective, a steady approach is advocated for instead of pursuing rapid growth stimulated by artificial means. This viewpoint suggests that maintaining stable growth over time will be more beneficial in the long run than experiencing quick but unsustainable expansion.  The writer also briefly touches on military matters by highlighting some reasons why there may be an improved sense of safety today. This includes increased economic integration leading to shared interests among major powers and reduced chances for large-scale conflict. However, it is essential to note that this aspect is not extensively discussed in comparison to other points raised within the article.  Overall, despite acknowledging challenges ahead such as debt management and policy-making concerns related to growth initiatives post-financial crisis; optimism pervades this news article regarding future global recovery prospects. The interconnected nature of economies along with improved relations between major powers provides a foundation for cautious optimism moving forward.  It should be noted that while these perspectives provide valuable insights into potential trends for next year's economic outlooks; macroeconomic forecasts are always subject to change due to various unpredictable factors, global events, and policy adjustments.",explain
"This news article is about the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award, which was established in 2000 by Credit Suisse, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien, and the Lucerne Festival. The purpose of this award is to support young musical talent and invest in the future of music at an international level.  The article mentions that this award is not a competition in the conventional sense. Instead, five jury members each nominate one candidate for consideration. The decision-making process involves an hour-long recital covering various musical epochs and an interview. The jury then reaches a verdict through open discussion.  In 2012, violinist Vilde Frang was selected as the winner of the award unanimously by the jury. Pamela Rosenberg, former Artistic Director of the Berlin Philharmonic and one of the jury members, praised Frang for her range of colors in playing at a young age and her expressive power and stylistic assurance.  Frang expresses her appreciation for receiving this prestigious award and describes it as something different from other awards or scholarships she has received before. She feels honored to perform at THIS Festival (referring to Lucerne Festival) with THIS orchestra (referring to Vienna Philharmonic), under a conductor whom she admires greatly.  Frang had been associated with Lucerne Festival since she was a student studying under Kolja Blacher, Concertmaster of Lucerne Festival Orchestra. An opportunity to perform with Vienna Philharmonic is particularly special to her as she grew up listening to their recordings.  One reason cited by Peter Hagmann (another jury member) for Frang's victory is her innate sense of musicality in contemporary repertoire – an aspect that resonates with Lucerne Festival's support for new music as well as young artists.  The article also provides some background on Frang's musical journey. Being born into a family where her father was a professional double-bass player influenced her initial inclination towards that instrument. However, her father decided that they couldn't fit three double-basses into their small family car, so she started learning the violin instead. Frang picked up the violin at the age of four and immediately felt connected to it. At 11 years old, she caught the attention of renowned violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, who became a mentor in Frang's life.  Overall, this news article highlights the significance of the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award and introduces Vilde Frang as its recipient in 2012. It also provides insights into Frang's musical background and her excitement for performing at Lucerne Festival with Vienna Philharmonic. Continuing with the explanation of the news article, it emphasizes Frang's unique approach to music and her ability to communicate emotions through her performances. Peter Hagmann, a jury member, recognizes Frang's power in conveying not only classical pieces like Mozart and Bach but also contemporary repertoire like Lutoslawski. He believes that an artist should not just play the music but also recognize its value, fill it with emotion, and communicate something personal to the audience – all of which Frang accomplishes in a remarkable way.  Frang's passion for music stems from a young age. Despite not finding practice itself intriguing, she always enjoyed playing. At the age of 11, getting noticed by Anne-Sophie Mutter was a turning point in her career as Mutter became a mentor figure who supported and guided her musical journey. It was Mutter's Freundeskreis Stiftung that provided Frang with the violin she plays - a 19th-century Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume.  The article concludes by acknowledging that Frang's story is still unfolding; there is much more ahead for her in establishing herself as an accomplished violinist. However, winning the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award is seen as a significant milestone for her career – one that will help elevate her status on both national and international platforms.  Overall, this news article celebrates Vilde Frang's accomplishment of winning the prestigious Credit Suisse Young Artist Award in 2012. It highlights her talent, dedication to music, and emotive performances while also shedding light on her musical upbringing and influences. The article portrays this award as not just another recognition but rather an exceptional opportunity for young artists like Frang to showcase their skills on renowned stages with esteemed orchestras like Vienna Philharmonic at esteemed festivals like Lucerne Festival.

"This news article discusses various aspects of Switzerland's economic success and the challenges it currently faces. It highlights four key factors contributing to Switzerland's success: a liberal labor market, high workforce integration, well-trained employees, and openness towards international trade. These factors have allowed Switzerland to weather the financial crisis well.  However, the article also emphasizes a future challenge for Switzerland - an aging population combined with predicted immigration of about 40,000 people per year will result in a shortage of about 400,000 workers by 2030. The author argues that immigration is crucial for Switzerland's continued success and disagrees with initiatives against mass immigration and planned-economy quota-setting.  The article acknowledges certain problems that need attention regarding cultural differences with foreign bosses but suggests that the focus should be on utilizing untapped potential among skilled workers already in Switzerland rather than increasing immigration. The culture of working as an older person needs to be developed further, and there is room for increasing women's productivity in the workforce.  Wage discrimination has significantly reduced over recent years due to new hiring practices; however, employment relationships that have evolved over time still require further progress towards equal pay for equal work. Despite this issue, wages are distributed more equally in Switzerland compared to other countries according to statistical measures like the Gini coefficient.  The author also raises concerns about rising living costs in Switzerland which impact families' budgets significantly. Emphasizing economic considerations, they suggest focusing less on increasing wages and more on finding ways to lower living costs.  When discussing education systems in Switzerland, it is highlighted that while their dual educational system has been successful so far (combining vocational training with general education), there is social pressure threatening its value as it tends towards becoming similar to high school education. Reforms are suggested within primary schools as well by placing emphasis on teaching STEM disciplines (science, technology engineering, math).  Regarding the financial sector in Switzerland, it is suggested that increased regulation will lead to cost pressure and job cuts, but the author remains optimistic about the competitive strength of Swiss banks. They believe that a ""clean money strategy"" focused on performance and quality will be necessary in the future.  The article concludes by stating that Switzerland is well-positioned for the future, particularly in industries benefiting from global megatrends such as healthcare, energy, urbanization, water, and aging. However, it notes that Switzerland tends to forget its own excellence compared to other countries.  In summary, this news article discusses Switzerland's economic success based on factors like a liberal labor market and a well-trained workforce while also highlighting challenges such as an aging population and rising living costs. It emphasizes the importance of immigration for maintaining economic performance but suggests leveraging untapped potential among existing workers. The article also touches upon wage discrimination concerns, necessary reforms in education systems, and possible changes in the financial sector. Overall, it suggests that Switzerland's position remains strong but highlights areas where improvement is needed. The article explores Switzerland's economic landscape in greater detail, shedding light on various aspects that contribute to its success. One notable factor is the country's high level of workforce integration. Among the population between 15 and 64 years old, a staggering 82% are engaged in working life, surpassing any other country. This demonstrates Switzerland's ability to effectively incorporate individuals into its labor market.  Additionally, Switzerland boasts a strong work ethic, with its citizens working more hours per week than any other European nation - an average of 41.9 hours. This diligent approach has undoubtedly contributed to Switzerland's ability to weather economic crises successfully.  Another crucial component of Switzerland's success is its well-trained employees at every level. The article attributes this achievement to the country's dual educational system, which combines vocational training with general education. By providing students with practical skills alongside academic knowledge, the educational system sets a solid foundation for a highly competent workforce.  Switzerland's openness towards global trade and international engagement plays a vital role in driving its economy forward as well. The country earns approximately one out of every two francs from exports and demonstrates robust industrialization; 20% of its GDP stems from industry-related activities, solidifying it as one of the most industrialized nations globally.  However, despite these impressive accomplishments, there are challenges lying ahead for Switzerland due to demographic shifts and immigration patterns. An aging population combined with projected annual immigration rates indicate that by 2030, there will be a deficit of around 400,000 workers within the Swiss job market.  The author believes that this situation necessitates continued reliance on immigration as part of their economic strategy moving forward. They express concern over initiatives against mass immigration and argue against planned-economy quota-setting proposals marketed by groups like Ecopop; rather than finding practical solutions for managing labor shortages sustainably over time - focusing solely on fixed quotas wouldn't serve Swiss interests effectively.  Furthermore, by recalling fears from the early 1970s about foreign influences dominating Switzerland, the author suggests that similar arguments blaming free movement of persons for various problems today are misleading and unfounded. They highlight that a significant proportion of immigrants come to Switzerland for reasons unrelated to the free movement agreement. However, they do acknowledge cultural differences with foreign bosses as an issue but stress the importance of addressing such problems while aiming to keep immigration levels as low as possible.  The article suggests tapping into existing potential within Swiss society instead of solely relying on immigration to bridge the forthcoming labor gap. It suggests encouraging older individuals to continue working and increasing productivity among women, with untapped potential in both these demographics already present in Switzerland.  While wage discrimination has decreased significantly through improved hiring practices, further efforts are needed concerning employment relationships that have evolved over time. The introduction of tools like pay parity dialogue is recommended to help enterprises ensure equal pay for equal work. Nevertheless, compared to other countries, statistics indicate a more equitable distribution of wages in Switzerland, accompanied by a declining prevalence of working poor individuals.  In terms of living costs, families' budgets are increasingly strained due to rising expenses surpassing those allocated for food. Given this situation and economic considerations, the article recommends prioritizing efforts towards lowering living costs instead of focusing solely on wage increases.  Turning toward education systems within Switzerland, attention is drawn towards preserving the value and effectiveness of their successful dual system. Social pressures risk watering down vocational training elements in favor of a more generalized high school approach; hence reforms highlighting STEM disciplines at primary school level are forwarded emphasizing their significance considering engineering's substantial contribution historically towards Swiss prosperity.  Regarding Switzerland's financial sector –a key pillar supporting its economy– it acknowledges that increasing regulation will lead companies within this industry encountering cost pressure necessitating job cuts in order maintain competitiveness globally. However concerns aside it expresses confidence that current trends will pave an optimistic future for Swiss banks given promising markets such as healthcare, energy along with the burgeoning luxury goods industry driven by increasing global prosperity.  In conclusion, the article delves into Switzerland's economic success factors such as a liberal labor market, strong workforce integration, proficient education systems, and international trade openness. While acknowledging challenges such as an aging population and rising costs of living, it emphasizes the importance of immigration in maintaining productivity. The discussion spans wage discrimination concerns, the need for reforms within education systems at all levels, and potential adaptations within Switzerland's financial sector. Overall, it asserts that despite existing challenges and areas for improvement; Switzerland is well-positioned compared to other countries but must not undervalue its own achievements.",explain
"This news article discusses the currency strategies and policies of major global economies, particularly the US, EU, Japan, and Britain. The report argues against claims of substantial manipulation in these economies' exchange rates and instead emphasizes the experimental monetary policies implemented to boost domestic demand.  According to Anezka Christovova, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse, there is no evidence to support significant manipulation by these G4 economies in the past year. The report dismisses any talk suggesting otherwise as ""much ado about nothing."" Instead, the article suggests that these economies have been implementing increasingly experimental monetary policies aimed at stimulating their respective domestic demands.  The article highlights the massive asset-buying programs undertaken by both the United States and Japan as examples of these non-conventional policies. These programs have become necessary due to previous attempts at lowering interest rates in response to global recession failing to revive stagnant economies.  While such policies have had an impact on exchange rates, Deverell and Christovova from Credit Suisse argue that this has not been their primary focus. They mention that when considering real effective terms - considering trade-weighted values - currencies like the dollar, yen, euro and sterling are within 10 percent of their 30-year average. Therefore, they conclude there is little evidence suggesting current exchange rates are significantly out of equilibrium.  However, they do note that based on Credit Suisse's fair value model; only one currency stands out as significantly undervalued - Chinese RMB (renminbi).  Furthermore, it is highlighted that not just emerging market currencies but even troubled ones like Eurozone's euro had been appreciating before Cyprus announced a bailout plan. This situation had raised concerns regarding European exporters being negatively affected by a strong currency further delaying recovery efforts.  Credit Suisse attributes this strength in the euro partly due to reductions in size for European Central Bank's balance sheet as banks within Eurozone began repaying emergency loans taken from ECB during the region's financial turmoil. Simultaneously, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) are expanding their balance sheets through asset-buying programs, effectively adding upward pressure on the euro.  The article forecasts that with the Fed buying $85 billion in assets monthly and BOJ accelerating government bond purchases to nearly 84 trillion yen this year, there is potential for the euro to reach $1.40 in value within a year.  Nonetheless, Credit Suisse notes that the eurozone faces downside risks due to worsening economic conditions. The latest Markit composite purchasing managers' index indicates a contraction in manufacturing and services sectors.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has not ruled out an interest rate cut at the ECB's policy meeting in May and has also left open possibilities for ""non-standard measures"" like bond purchases to revive Eurozone's economy.  Considering these factors, Credit Suisse warns that emerging market policymakers who intervene to stabilize exchange rates may not remain passive bystanders. They argue that with major economies expected to continue quantitative easing programs throughout 2013, emerging markets may resort to ""dirty floats"" - actively managing their exchange rates - possibly becoming even more assertive over time.  In conclusion, this news article delves into currency strategies of major global economies and dispels claims of substantial manipulation while emphasizing experimental monetary policies aimed at boosting domestic demand. It discusses factors impacting currency values such as reduced ECB balance sheet size juxtaposed against expansions from Fed and BOJ.

"This news article discusses the likelihood of a common issuance of bonds in the eurozone, as well as the current state of global markets and economies.  The article starts by stating that, despite the long-term benefits, it is unlikely that there will be a broader common issuance of bonds in the eurozone at this time. The main reason for this is that such an option is politically less viable. While stronger countries may benefit from reduced risk to their financial systems, politicians and the public do not see this benefit as significant enough to warrant such a large political step towards common eurozone issuance. Therefore, although there are advantages for stronger countries, the amount of fiscal sovereignty they would have to give up is still too large to consider at this point.  However, even without a grand and instant solution like a common government bond issuance, it is believed that the eurozone will hold together. The article mentions policy responses such as the Stabilization Fund and predicts more steps to address immediate liquidity and solvency issues. This combination of fiscal improvement and ongoing support from central institutions will slowly move towards stronger fiscal centralization without necessarily needing a common issuance at this point. This is seen positively for long-term stability in the euro.  The article then shifts its focus to global market dynamics. It notes that despite recent market instability worldwide, both the dollar and euro have held up relatively well so far. There has been some weakness in emerging markets and commodity-related currencies but nothing significant enough reflecting stable situations at current prices.  There is also a risk of seeing some dollar strength due to ongoing instability if there are no promises or indications of new softer monetary policy steps from the US. Nonetheless, overall stability within certain ranges can be expected in currency markets for several months ahead.  The bond market has experienced significant declines in benchmark bond yields globally led by concerns over recession probability coupled with expectations that central banks might respond by extending their operations with added liquidity measures – exerting downward pressure on bond yields. Additionally, there has been notable volatility in the equity market with corrections from recent highs and uncertain outlooks.  The article mentions that credit rating downgrades, such as Japan's recent downgrade, have had little impact on markets. The ratings decisions are seen as not carrying significant weight in the market as they are viewed to be behind the curve in recognizing deteriorating fiscal conditions.  Regarding the global economy, there is a delicate balance between simulative monetary policy and strong growth from emerging markets against the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and weaker leading indicators. However, despite concerns over unemployment rates in the US and Europe's debt crisis affecting sentiment for consumers and businesses, there is an overall relatively constructive outlook with expectations of continued global demand driven by emerging markets and stimulative US monetary policy.  In conclusion, this news article discusses the unlikelihood of a common issuance of bonds in the eurozone at present due to political considerations. It then provides an overview of current market dynamics globally, highlighting stability within certain ranges but acknowledging volatility and risks associated with recession probability and fiscal conditions. Despite challenges, there remains a moderately optimistic view regarding global economic outlook driven by emerging markets' growth and supportive monetary policies.",explain
"This news article discusses the resilience of the Swiss export industry during the recent recession and highlights factors that have contributed to its ability to recover quickly. Compared to other countries, Switzerland experienced a relatively small decline in goods exports, with only a 14 percent drop in 2009.  One key reason for Switzerland's resistance to the economic crisis is its sector portfolio, which is less volatile compared to countries like Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and the US. The pharmaceutical industry plays a significant role in Switzerland's export sector and is relatively non-cyclical. Additionally, vehicle manufacturing has a smaller share in Swiss exports compared to other countries.  Although sectors other than pharmaceuticals and vehicle manufacturing make up a similar share of total exports for Switzerland and its neighboring countries, there are no specific advantages or disadvantages in terms of Switzerland's ability to withstand crises. However, as a small open economy that is vulnerable to external shocks, reducing dependence on individual countries can help minimize vulnerability.  The article suggests that although all sectors in Switzerland are better diversified than the average for OECD countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), they still lag behind their competitors in neighboring countries like Germany and France as well as the UK and US. It specifically mentions room for improvement in diversification within medical technology and metal industries while noting that pharmaceuticals and watch industries have better geographical diversification.  Geographical diversification not only allows capitalizing on growth sources from various countries but also acts as a natural hedge against currency fluctuations. The high quality of Swiss exports has likely contributed positively to its resistance during the crisis. By using unit value (average price per unit weight) as an indicator of export quality, it was found that Swiss goods generally have higher unit values compared to other countries.  Switzerland stands out with higher mean unit values across all exported goods when compared with other nations included in this study. Sectors characterized by lower values do not significantly reduce Swiss export unit values. For example, Germany has a more significant presence in the automotive industry, which falls short compared to high-tech industries like precision instruments, pharmaceuticals, and watches present in Switzerland.  The article also emphasizes that Swiss exports mainly compete on quality rather than price. In 2010, approximately 63 percent of Swiss exports competed on quality while only six percent showed a disadvantage relative to foreign rivals. However, when it comes to competing on price, just under 10 percent of Swiss goods have an advantage compared to competitors.  To remain successful in the future, the Swiss export industry needs to maintain its lead in terms of quality and technology through constant innovation. This is crucial as other economies seek to replicate these qualities at lower costs. The article concludes by highlighting the need for continuous improvements and outstanding service to reinforce Switzerland's ""price premium"" against its competitors.  In summary, this news article discusses how Switzerland's export industry fared during the recent recession and attributes its resilience partially due to factors such as sector portfolio diversification and higher quality products with higher unit values. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a focus on innovation and technology advancements for future success in an increasingly competitive global market.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of the residential and commercial property markets in Switzerland. It highlights several factors that are influencing price growth and vacancy rates in both sectors.  In terms of residential property, it is noted that there may be a slight dampening effect on demand due to various factors such as stricter lending practices, limited speculative transactions, and a lack of oversupply. However, this is not expected to completely halt price rises, with estimates suggesting a 3-5 percent increase this year. This indicates that there is still a risk of a market correction happening at some point. The article suggests that the only thing likely to halt price growth entirely would be a sharp rise in interest rates.  One key factor preventing the residential property market from overheating is the limited speculative transactions taking place. Speculative transactions refer to buying properties with the intention of selling them quickly for profit, which can drive up prices artificially. Additionally, lending has been curbed by many institutions as they tighten monitoring and assess growing risks in order to avoid potential instability.  Furthermore, there is currently no oversupply on the residential property market despite having a full supply pipeline. This shortage of available residential space in central locations will likely continue to be an issue in 2013 since structural weaknesses in the construction sector make it difficult to produce more apartments.  Vacancy rates are expected to rise first in peripheral and rural regions before becoming noticeable overall. Despite this expectation, it is predicted that Switzerland's overall vacancy rate will remain below its long-term average of 1 percent for this year but only slightly below.  If interest rates were to substantially rise, high property prices would lead to higher running costs for homeowners which could affect demand and result in an increase in vacancy rates even further. However, it should be noted that these trends mainly pertain to owner-occupied residential properties rather than commercial properties.  Interestingly, while commercial office space prices have also seen significant increases like their residential counterparts, there is no sign of overheating in terms of demand. In fact, the office market is experiencing rising vacancy rates mainly in town centers as companies are attracted to cheaper locations with good transport links. This shift is facilitated by low interest rates which allow for office developments outside the city center and encourage businesses to consolidate different locations efficiently while reducing costs.  This trend toward new ways of working, such as desk sharing, adds to the overall impact on demand for office space. Desk sharing allows companies to have more flexibility in managing their space requirements and can result in space savings of 10-20 percent on average. The attractiveness of such practices has led more companies to explore similar approaches, further influencing overall demand for office space across the economy.  The article suggests that this rising supply and changing dynamics within commercial properties could potentially lead to an oversupply and increased vacancy rates by the end of 2012. However, it also mentions that the ongoing tertiarization process within industry - where industrial companies orient themselves towards services - will help alleviate any potential oversupply issues as it leads to a growing demand for office spaces.  Overall, this article provides insights into the factors affecting both residential and commercial property markets in Switzerland. It highlights trends such as limited speculative transactions and stricter lending practices that are preventing a complete halt in price growth for residential properties. It also emphasizes factors like desk sharing and businesses moving away from city centers which are impacting demand and vacancy rates within commercial properties.",explain
"The news article discusses the sport of rowing and follows the perspective of a rower named Cornelia. It emphasizes the physical demands and technical requirements of rowing, as well as the mental focus and concentration that are necessary for success in the sport.  Rowing is portrayed as a strenuous sport that requires skill, coordination, and teamwork. The article highlights the importance of smooth, harmonious movements in order to maintain balance and stay on course. Cornelia explains that jerky movements can disrupt the delicate balance of the boat. This suggests that rowing is not as easy or monotonous as it may seem from afar.  While rowers' cyclical motions may induce a meditative state, Cornelia states that she must remain fully concentrated on her physical movements and be present in the moment. Daydreaming or being distracted could cause her to lose focus and deviate from their intended course.  The article also mentions how rowers primarily face backward, looking at their point of departure rather than where they are headed. Only when they turn around after about five kilometers do they have a chance to relax briefly and appreciate their surroundings – such as sunrises, snow-covered mountains, or families of swans – before returning back to their starting point.  Cornelia's dedication to rowing is highlighted through her commitment to early morning training sessions. She enjoys being outdoors for training but also utilizes indoor rowing machines during stormy weather. Despite waking up early every day for training, she claims not to get tired because she values sleep-ins on weekends.  Furthermore, Cornelia explains her involvement in various types of boats within different teams at Zurich Rowing Club. Each boat type offers unique challenges and experiences which allow her continuous learning opportunities. While competing in regattas is not currently one of her goals due to increased training requirements, she occasionally participates in friendly competitions with a focus on improving technique rather than winning.  Lastly, teamwork is emphasized as a crucial aspect of rowing. Cornelia mentions that coordination with her teammates is essential, describing the importance of pulling together and coordinating movements in a synchronized manner.  Overall, the article provides insights into the physical and mental aspects of rowing, as well as Cornelia's passion for the sport and her commitment to continuous improvement. It highlights the discipline required in terms of technique, coordination, and teamwork while also acknowledging the beauty and sense of accomplishment that come with successful rowing experiences. The article also sheds light on Cornelia's introduction to rowing and her journey as a rower. She was first introduced to the sport during a team event eight years ago. Immediately captivated by the fresh air and fascinated by the technical requirements of rowing, she underwent basic training and subsequently joined the Zurich Rowing Club.  Since then, Cornelia has been dedicated to her training routine, which primarily takes place in the mornings. Whether it's on the water or using an indoor rowing machine, she ensures that she devotes herself to improving her skills and performance.  Cornelia explains that rowing offers a variety of boats for training and competition. Her favorite is the eight, which is known for its efficiency in energy usage and speed across the lake. Additionally, she trains with different boats throughout the week like double sculls, pairs (using one oar), fours or quadruple sculls. On occasion, she also ventures out alone in a single boat referred to as a skiff.  She highlights how each type of boat presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth - this keeps her engaged, constantly learning new techniques while striving for more control over particular boats such as skiffs.  While Cornelia acknowledges that participating in regattas requires more intense training sessions along with additional time spent at weight rooms, it remains not one of her primary goals at present. Instead, she focuses on improving her technique through friendly competitions while maintaining an enjoyable journey of constant self-improvement.  Working within a team is one aspect that truly appeals to Cornelia about rowing. She expresses how crucial coordination is among teammates compared to sports like basketball or football where individual performance may be prioritized more heavily.  In conclusion, this news article provides an intimate portrayal of Cornelia's dedication to rowing as well as insights into various aspects of this strenuous yet rewarding sport. It emphasizes not only physical fitness but also mental focus and teamwork necessary for success. By sharing Cornelia's experiences, the article offers readers a glimpse into the challenges and joys of rowing while highlighting its potential as an engaging and fulfilling recreational or competitive pursuit.",explain
"This news article discusses the changing patterns in life expectancy and retirement in Switzerland, as well as the challenges these changes pose to the country's pension system. It highlights the need for reforms to secure pensions for future generations.  The article starts by stating that life expectancy is currently 73.7 years for men and 76.8 years for women. This increase in life expectancy means that traditional boundaries between different stages of life are becoming blurred, including the lines between education and gainful employment, as well as work and retirement.  Despite these changing patterns, the regulatory framework of Switzerland's AHV (Old Age and Survivors Insurance) has been slow to adapt to these changes. The article argues that this is surprising considering the forecasted aging population trends.  The ratio of older people to people of working age is increasing steadily over time, which will place a growing strain on AHV and potentially lead to deficits. While Switzerland still performs well compared to other countries with its three-pillar retirement provision system (including occupational and private pension schemes), it may still need reforms.  In many OECD countries, people will need to work longer before they can retire. However, little has changed in Switzerland since increasing the retirement age for women from 62 to 64 years old under a previous revision.  To secure pensions in the long term for future generations, reforms can be focused either on funding or benefits within AHV. Funding discussions often center around increasing either wages or taxes (such as value-added tax) but both have potential negative impacts on competitiveness or private consumption costs respectively.  On the benefits side, adjusting pension standards may help somewhat with limiting expenses but doesn't address the overall burden on active generations due to more retirees within a pay-as-you-go system. To counteract this burden sustainably requires adjusting the mathematical ratio between those receiving pensions and those contributing - raising or making flexible upwards towards a higher statutory retirement age is seen as inevitable according to experts cited in the article.  The article suggests implementing a debt brake for social insurance and utilizing automated processes to support these changes. It also notes that extending the length of working life is no longer a revolutionary idea, as more and more people in Switzerland are continuing to work past retirement age.  While the trend towards early retirement has weakened, there is still a substantial number of workers who would like to continue working. The job market, however, lacks a systematic human resources policy to address this need. Employers will have to reconsider their position and create more flexible conditions to benefit from the experience and expertise of older workers.  In conclusion, this article emphasizes the need for reforms in Switzerland's AHV system due to changing life expectancy patterns and an aging population. Reforms could focus on funding or benefits but addressing the growing burden on active generations requires adjusting retirement age ratios or making it flexible upwards. Implementing policies that encourage older workers' employment by leveraging their skills and experience is also seen as essential for addressing future workforce challenges caused by aging staff demographics.",explain
"This news article discusses the role and responsibilities of a relationship manager in private banking, specifically within Credit Suisse. The relationship manager's main focus is on analyzing and managing the asset allocation of their clients and staying informed about trends in the equity and bond markets.  The article emphasizes the proactive approach adopted by relationship managers in order to cater to their clients' needs effectively. By staying on top of their clients' latest demands, relationship managers can build stronger relationships with them, seek new business opportunities, and outpace competitors. This involves starting work early in the morning to review market news and client emails before heading into the office at 7:00 a.m.  Once at work, the relationship manager typically begins by reading morning newspapers over coffee at a nearby restaurant. They then embark on planning their day by prioritizing calls and emails as necessary. Throughout the day, they focus largely on responding to incoming communications from their clients while also reaching out proactively when required.  It is important for relationship managers to be flexible as each working day is often shaped by their clients' needs. If clients are engaged in transactions or deals that require attention, those become a major focus for the relationship manager. Collaboration between Private Banking Australia and other business areas within Credit Suisse occurs frequently based on specific transactions or deals being pursued.  Part of a Relationship Manager's role includes preparing for client governance or investment committee meetings where they discuss monthly or quarterly reviews with clients. This requires thorough analysis of information provided by clients regarding their investment preferences alongside current financial market conditions.  Relationship prospecting plays an essential role as well since acquiring new business is critical. The Relationship Manager spends time researching potential prospects whose business they aim to win over for Credit Suisse. Building trust with existing and potential clients while positioning Credit Suisse as a trusted partner becomes paramount in this process.  The article highlights that many new businesses come through referrals from existing satisfied customers which demonstrates trustworthiness being essential throughout this industry.  The future outlook for Credit Suisse in Australia is positive according to the Relationship Manager. Australia is considered to have a well-structured and transparent economy, making it an attractive place to conduct business. The 157-year experience of Credit Suisse also adds credibility and appeal, as it reflects the bank's ability to successfully manage client money through various economic cycles and market downturns while maintaining professionalism.  The article also mentions a shift in Australian investors' mindset after the financial crisis. Investors realized that diversification across different asset classes, including foreign assets, can improve returns and reduce volatility. This change in perception emphasizes the importance of offering a wide range of products and services by banks such as Credit Suisse.  In conclusion, this news article provides insight into the responsibilities of a relationship manager within Credit Suisse's private banking division in Australia.

"This news article discusses the ongoing debate in Switzerland regarding a proposed increase in the price of the motorway vignette, which is a permit that allows drivers to use all Swiss motorways and expressways. The current price of the vignette is 40 francs, and the proposed increase would raise it to 100 francs.  The main reason for this proposed price hike is to generate additional revenue for expanding the road network and facilitating the federal government's takeover of national roadways. It is estimated that this increase will bring in 300 million francs in extra revenue. The Swiss Federal Councilor Doris Leuthard, who heads the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), supports this measure and considers it necessary given the increasing use of roadways and planned infrastructure investments.  On one side of the debate are those who argue that raising vignette prices would ensure fair financing for maintaining and expanding Switzerland's road network while benefiting all regions of the country. These supporters also highlight how Switzerland's excellent road network contributes to its competitiveness on a global economic scale.  On the other side are opponents who question why drivers should have to bear additional costs when they already cover more than 100 percent of the expenses associated with maintaining roads. Some argue that instead of increasing vignette prices, there should be greater investment in public transportation or exploration of mobility pricing based on actual usage.  Various individuals were present at a Lifefair Forum where these topics were discussed including politicians, transportation experts, and business leaders. The National Council approved this bill with support from both left-leaning parties like Green Party representative Bastien Girod as well as right-leaning parties like former Swiss People's Party (SVP) Vice President Walter Frey.  While those supporting an increase emphasize infrastructure needs due to increased traffic congestion around Zurich specifically, critics raise questions about whether so much transportation is actually necessary or efficient in today's world. Girod argues for greater efficiency rather than more asphalt, emphasizing that commuting can often be a burden for many individuals. Frey counters this by highlighting the importance of economic growth, suggesting it would not be possible without accessible transportation options.  In conclusion, the article describes the ongoing debate in Switzerland regarding a proposed increase in motorway vignette prices. Supporters argue that this measure is necessary to generate revenue for infrastructure development and fair financing of roads, while opponents question why drivers should pay more when they already cover excessive costs. The discussion extends to broader questions about the necessity and efficiency of transportation in today's society. The article also highlights the viewpoint of Hans-Jörg Bertschi, a business owner, who criticizes the proposed increase in vignette prices as a ""tax on leaving your car at home."" He disagrees with the idea of mobility pricing or collecting fees based on actual road usage. On the other hand, Kathrin Amacker, Head of Communications & Public Affairs for the Swiss Federal Railways, and Ernst Stocker, Zurich Cantonal Councilor for the SVP and Director of Economic Affairs, support the bill.  Amidst these arguments about financing and transportation needs in Switzerland, it is important to note that there will be a public vote on November 24 to decide whether or not to approve this proposed change to federal law. The fact that a referendum committee gathered enough signatures to bring this matter to public vote shows that there is significant opposition and interest in discussing this issue further.  The article suggests that while Switzerland does have an efficient road network compared to some other countries with less traffic congestion and fewer traffic jams, there is still room for improvement. However, critics argue that instead of investing more in roads and increasing vignette prices further burdening drivers economically, efforts should be focused on finding ways to promote alternative means of transport such as public transportation or carpooling.  Ultimately, this debate revolves around striking a balance between increasing revenue for infrastructure development while ensuring fair financing and considering factors such as environmental concerns related to transportation. Both sides raise valid points regarding efficiency versus expansion of road networks and potential alternatives such as mobility pricing.  As this topic continues to ignite heated debate among experts from different fields at forums like Lifefair Forum where leading minds gather together; it remains uncertain what decision will be reached by voters.",explain
"This news article discusses the concept of responsible investing and compares the performance of two contrasting funds: The Vice Fund (now renamed as the Barrier Fund) and the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund.  The Vice Fund invests in businesses considered to be socially questionable, such as tobacco, alcohol, gaming, and defense/aerospace industries. On the other hand, the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund consists of stocks of companies that have been screened for certain social, human rights, and environmental criteria.  Data gathered over a period of nearly 14 years shows that the Vice Fund performed better than the Social Index Fund. The example of the Vice Fund suggests that investments in what are considered ""unethical"" stocks tend to outperform.  The rationale for vice investing is that these companies have a steady demand for their goods and services regardless of economic conditions. They tend to operate globally, are high-margin businesses with high entry barriers.  The article also mentions another study investigating stock markets in countries characterized by corruption. Surprisingly, it concludes that better returns were generated from investments made in countries generally considered most corrupt. Responsible investors may contribute to the outperformance of ""sin stocks."" If a large enough proportion of investors avoid sin businesses due to ethical considerations, their share prices will be depressed and offer elevated returns to those less troubled by ethical considerations.  To provide a long-term perspective on sin stocks' performance, researchers looked at over 100 years of tobacco industry data. It was discovered that during the transition period from when tobacco was not considered harmful until its negative impact became widely recognized in 1950s; its shares underperformed in America. However, from 1960s to 2000s when its health impact was well-known; tobacco companies outperformed comparable firms by over +3% per year.  Although sin stocks can deliver strong financial performance despite their negative societal impact, there is evidence suggesting responsible investing can also be fruitful. Responsible investors who still have a stake in non-ethical companies have two options - ""exit"" and ""voice."" Exit means withdrawing from the investment relationship, while voice refers to speaking out and attempting to improve corporate behavior. By engaging with executives, submitting proxy proposals, and influencing regulators and standard setters, responsible investors believe they can guide management toward improved financial performance and enhanced social conditions.  The article highlights the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) as an example where the voice strategy proved more rewarding than exit. Initially blacklisting entire countries that didn't meet certain criteria, CalPERS faced significant losses on its emerging markets portfolio. However, in 2007 it switched to a principles-based approach that involved carefully selecting companies in the developing world and engaging with them through dialogue, engagement, and shareholder activism.  According to Credit Suisse's report cited in the article, engagement is not only socially responsible but has also proven to be profitable.  Overall, this news article provides insights into responsible investing and discusses the performance of sin stocks compared to socially screened funds. It suggests that investments considered unethical may deliver better returns but also emphasizes that responsible investing can be fruitful when done right.",explain
"This news article discusses the conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Switzerland and their prospects for success. The article highlights the factors that contribute to business success, such as infrastructure and skilled employees. However, it also mentions that overall, SMEs' assessment of Switzerland as a business location has slightly deteriorated compared to the previous year.  One of the main reasons for this decline is the appreciation of the Swiss franc since the abandonment of the EUR/CHF exchange-rate floor. This currency appreciation has had negative effects on SMEs, with many viewing its impact on the economic environment and international ties as negative. Furthermore, regulatory framework conditions are seen as an impediment to success, with many firms expecting further deterioration in this area.  The article emphasizes that addressing these challenges is crucial if Swiss SMEs want to secure their chances of success, especially in a more troubled economic climate. It suggests that easing regulations on businesses should become a priority in political agendas.  The article also discusses investment patterns among SMEs between 2009 and 2014. Around 90 percent of surveyed SMEs made investments during this period, spending an average of 10 percent of their sales on investments. Service-sector companies and high-tech industries were found to have higher investment proportions compared to retail companies.  Real estate was identified as the most significant area for investment, followed by equipment. The survey indicated that real estate investment has gained importance across all sectors over the past six years. Tourism/entertainment sectors, healthcare/education/social services sectors were found to be above-average investors in real estate while high-tech industries focused more on research and development.  In terms of foreign investments, only 6 percent of all surveyed SMEs invested abroad between 2009-2014. The appreciation of Swiss franc this year was predicted by many SMEs to be more difficult to absorb than what was experienced during 2010/2011 when it appreciated before. Around 40 percent of SMEs anticipated a decline in sales and margins due to the currency appreciation, with 30 percent expecting a decline in competitiveness. Industrial and retail sectors were particularly under pressure.  The article found that SMEs that are reducing their investment due to the strong Swiss franc tend to be more export-oriented compared to those maintaining or increasing investment. It also noted that diversification through strategic interests and cooperation agreements helped alleviate some of the negative effects of Swiss franc appreciation on SME investment.  Regarding financing, cash and traditional bank loans were identified as the primary sources for financing investments among Swiss SMEs. Non-bank loans played a role for young businesses, while low interest rates between 2009-2014 had only a moderate effect on overall SME investment activity. The uncertainty about the future course of the economy was cited as a significant factor influencing investment decisions.  Lastly, the article highlighted some barriers to investment faced by SMEs. Around one-third of respondents stated that laws and regulations severely hampered key investment projects between 2009-2014. Economic and political uncertainty, as well as shortages of specialist skills, were also major obstacles according to more than one-quarter of surveyed SMEs.  In conclusion, while Switzerland has favorable conditions for business success such as infrastructure and skilled employees, challenges like currency appreciation, regulatory framework conditions, economic/political uncertainties remain concerns for Swiss SMEs' prospects for success. The article suggests easing regulations on businesses should be prioritized in order to secure their chances of success in an increasingly troubled economic climate. ",explain
"This news article discusses the problem of food wastage and the need for intervention to address this issue. The term ""wastage"" encompasses both food loss and food waste. Food waste refers to edible food that is discarded, while food loss refers to a decrease in the quantity or quality of food that was originally intended for human consumption.  In industrialized countries and emerging economies, consumers are primarily responsible for wasted foodstuffs. Lack of coordination among different players in the supply chain often leads to overproduction, resulting in more food being produced than can be sold. Examples of food waste include misshapen fruits deemed substandard according to quality criteria, expired products, and leftovers thrown away. Increasing consumer awareness can help reduce the amount of rejected and discarded food at the end of the supply chain.  In developing countries, logistical, technical, and financial limitations contribute to significant losses during production and transportation of foodstuffs. This is concerning since global production needs to increase by 60 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of a growing population with changing diets. To tackle this issue effectively, both public and private sectors must invest in infrastructure, transport systems, and packaging industries in developing countries.  Efficient food production not only reduces costs for consumers but also improves access for disadvantaged groups. Speed plays a crucial role in combating production losses – when moving quickly along the supply chain; there is a lower probability that foods will spoil. One potential solution is setting up processing plants closer to production facilities; however, this poses challenges for many developing countries without support from private or public sectors.  Interestingly enough, what may seem unthinkable in developing countries occurs regularly in high-income nations – significant amounts of perfectly edible foods intended for sale or consumption are thrown away each year. In Europe and North America alone, an average person discards between 95-115 kilos (209-253 pounds) annually compared to only 6-11 kilos (13-24 pounds) in sub-Saharan countries. Poor communication and cooperation among producers often result in surplus food that exceeds demand, requiring it to be discarded. Additionally, strict quality standards regarding the appearance of fruits and vegetables lead to the rejection of many foodstuffs that are not put on sale.  Thankfully, there has been a recent shift in thinking, with supermarket chains displaying imperfect produce such as three-legged carrots or bent cucumbers. Educating consumers about sell-by and expiry dates can also encourage responsible behavior when it comes to food consumption.  Peter Hess, a quality coordinator at DSR (a provider of Credit Suisse staff restaurants), suggests that guests becoming more tolerant toward the end-of-service offerings could significantly reduce food waste. If the salad bar doesn't need to look fully stocked until closing time, less food would be disposed of for safety reasons at the end of the day.  While reducing food waste may not solve all global supply shortage problems, it remains an effective way for each individual to make a positive impact. In June 2013 as part of the United Nations Environment Program's Think.Eat.Save campaign during World Environment Day, Credit Suisse's Sustainability Network launched an information campaign across its staff restaurants in Switzerland on the topic of food waste. The bank regularly measures food waste and implements annual measures aimed at reducing this problem.  Efforts such as precise planning by chefs, continuous fresh production practices, and service personnel's ability to cater specifically to guests' needs have already helped reduce plate-level wastage by about 30 grams since 2006.  Overall, this article emphasizes that addressing food wastage is crucial due to increasing global population growth and changing dietary patterns. It highlights how local communities can contribute through awareness-building campaigns while emphasizing public-private sector collaborations to invest in developing nations' infrastructure for increased production efficiencies.",explain
"This news article discusses the role of social networks, such as Twitter and traditional television, in mobilizing people and shaping political processes. It highlights both the positive and negative aspects of using these platforms for messaging, outreach, and discussing policy.  The article starts by mentioning President Obama's successful use of social media during his campaign to become President of the United States. It emphasizes that social networks have become an important tool for politicians to communicate with constituents and define themselves. However, it also points out that they can be used to spread misinformation, which can be difficult to correct once it goes viral.  The article then explores the connection between advertising money and campaigns. In countries like the United States where there is a long electoral cycle and significant financial investments in campaigns, social media becomes even more crucial. The medium has the potential to facilitate both positive and negative influences on elections.  Drawing lessons from uprisings in the Middle East, the article suggests that social media played a significant role in mobilizing discontented individuals against oppressive regimes. However, it acknowledges that rebuilding these societies after regime change requires time and continued coordination among diverse groups with different interests.  One concern raised in relation to social networks is their ability to reinforce herd mentality or echo chambers. People tend to join or believe something because others around them do likewise without critically examining evidence or alternative viewpoints. The more a social network focuses on like-minded individuals, the less diversity of opinions it promotes.  The situation in China is discussed as an interesting case study where blogging communities exist but are subject to control by authorities who allow some criticisms while monitoring others closely. Nationalistic sentiments are often reflected on Chinese blogs or social networks, potentially influencing public policy decisions not based on sound evidence but rather emotional reactions.  Comparatively speaking, openness prevails as a general presumption in U.S.-based platforms like Facebook where users enjoy freedom of expression without excessive censorship concerns; however, distorted or untruthful information remains a prominent challenge.  The article also touches on the entertainment and gaming aspects of social networks, indicating that active users may engage more for personal amusement or connecting with friends rather than political purposes. In reality, despite the vast number of connections people may have on platforms like Facebook, studies suggest that individuals typically interact closely with a smaller group of around 150 close acquaintances.  In conclusion, this news article explores various dimensions and dilemmas surrounding social networks. It acknowledges their potential to facilitate both positive and negative outcomes in political processes but also highlights the need for careful attention to how these platforms shape dynamics such as information dissemination, herd mentality, diversity of opinions, nationalistic sentiments, and entertainment value. The evolving nature of social networks necessitates continued analysis and study to fully understand their impact on societies. The article points out that the concept of social networks is relatively new, and therefore many questions surrounding their implications remain unanswered. It emphasizes the importance of paying attention to these platforms as society undergoes a transition in communication and information sharing.  One aspect that is discussed is the potential narcissistic nature of social media, particularly platforms like Facebook. People often post personal updates and photos, assuming others are interested in their lives. However, it raises the question of whether this assumption holds true or if it merely feeds into individuals' self-centeredness.  The article concludes by emphasizing that social networks are still in their early stages, and there is much we do not know about them. As they continue to evolve and shape our societies, it becomes increasingly essential for us to understand their effects on various aspects such as politics, information dissemination, public opinion formation, entertainment trends, societal cohesion/division dynamics, and more.

"The news article discusses a company called HighStep Systems AG that has developed a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations. The company's founder, Andreas Maurer, was inspired to create this system after his father fell from a ladder in the garden. HighStep Systems' climbing system offers several advantages over ladders and lifts, including enhanced safety, ergonomic working positions, reduced fatigue, and the ability to work for longer periods.  One of the key features of the HighStep system is an aluminum rail that is securely connected to the structure being worked on. This rail serves as a support for the mobile climbing equipment used by technicians. The company also plans to introduce a portable lift as part of their offerings. They are awaiting certification from TÜV which they expect will lead to further growth opportunities.  HighStep Systems currently focuses on two main markets: electricity pylons and wind turbines. The company can retrofit lifts onto existing structures in these markets, giving them a competitive advantage. With over a million electricity pylons and 72,000 wind turbines in Europe alone - both growing industries - the market potential is substantial. The CEO recognizes this opportunity but admits that for capacity reasons they have been cautious about expanding into Chinese and Indian markets.  The article mentions future possibilities for expanding HighStep Systems' products into other areas such as high-rack warehouses, cranes, lampposts, tall buildings, oil or gas tankers etc. The team is already considering new product types that could be attached to their rail system such as materials transporters or robots with cameras for monitoring purposes.  Despite its relatively short history since its founding in 2007, HighStep Systems has achieved significant milestones including securing major clients like Axpo who committed to using their climbing system in 2008. In 2010 alone they fitted their system on more than 1,000 pylons generating millions in revenues.  HighStep Systems has also secured financing to support its growth, with assistance from SVC - Ltd. This company provided a loan and has helped with business development, marketing, and finding partners in specific countries.  The biggest challenges faced by HighStep Systems have been the economic situation in Europe and the strength of the Swiss franc. The financial crisis and ongoing cost pressures have made clients more cautious. However, Maurer remains optimistic about the future due to the increasing emphasis on workplace safety and society's demographic problems. He believes that if they can tap into the market potential, their revenues could reach 100 or 200 million Swiss francs.  In summary, HighStep Systems AG has developed a climbing system that provides safe and cost-effective alternatives to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations such as electricity pylons and wind turbines. With several advantages over existing options, including enhanced safety features and ergonomic working positions, HighStep Systems has seen success fitting its system on numerous pylons generating significant revenues. Despite its success and potential for growth, HighStep Systems has faced challenges due to the economic situation in Europe and the strength of the Swiss franc. The financial crisis has led to clients becoming more cautious about investing in new systems, which has affected the company's sales. Additionally, the value of the Swiss franc against other currencies has made their products relatively more expensive for international markets.  However, HighStep Systems remains confident about its future prospects. The growing focus on workplace safety and society's demographic problems are expected to drive demand for their climbing system in the mid- to long-term. As older technicians with knee or back problems become more common and young technicians become rarer, HighStep Systems offers a solution that enables technicians to work longer while minimizing physical strain.  The company's commitment to innovation is evident not only in their development of a climbing system that outperforms traditional ladders but also through their plans for expanding into new markets and considering additional product options that can be attached to their rail system. These expansions could potentially open up a range of opportunities beyond just electricity pylons and wind turbines.  To support its growth plans, HighStep Systems has secured financing from SVC - Ltd., which not only provided a loan but also assisted with business development, marketing efforts, and finding partners in specific countries. This partnership highlights the confidence that venture capitalists have shown in HighStep Systems' potential as they look towards larger revenue figures.  Looking ahead, one aspect that may propel further growth for HighStep Systems is obtaining TÜV certification for their portable lift. This certification would add credibility to their product line and open up even more possibilities within various industries beyond just elevated workplaces like high-rack warehouses or cranes.  Furthermore, although currently cautious about expanding into Asian markets due to capacity limitations, there is significant untapped potential there as well as other international markets if properly strategized by this small company with ten employees.  In conclusion, despite challenges posed by the economic situation and currency fluctuations, HighStep Systems AG has managed to create a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations. Their innovative climbing system offers advantages in safety, ergonomics, and the potential to work longer hours without fatigue or strain. With major clients already on board, significant revenues generated, and plans for future expansions into different industries and markets, HighStep Systems is poised for continued growth in the coming years.",explain
"This news article discusses the changing role of banks and the dollar in the wake of the global financial crisis. It highlights that US and European banks have suffered significant losses during the crisis, leading them to raise capital from governments and private investors. However, it suggests that there are still anticipated major losses for many banks in the future, which will impact their profits for at least a decade.  The article then explores two potential scenarios for US and European banks moving forward. The first scenario involves these banks taking on more risk and leveraging up to fund economic growth both domestically and internationally. The second scenario suggests that these banks may take a back seat, allowing local emerging market banks and direct investment flows through capital markets to take the lead.   The article acknowledges that historically, US and European banks have recovered fairly quickly from credit slumps in past decades. However, it poses a question as to whether this recovery will be different this time around. Currently, there is political debate in America and Europe focused on ways to restrain leverage and risk-taking by banks.  The governments can enforce this restraint through three main routes: directing investments made into banking institutions; requiring bank breakups into smaller specialized units; or tightening regulations such as setting minimum liquidity standards or imposing overall minimum capital-to-loans ratios.  However, implementing these regulatory changes worldwide might prove challenging as different countries may adopt varying approaches. Consequently, there would be a significant difference in regulatory environments from one country to another.  Overall impact on individual banks and countries is likely to vary depending on their specific circumstances. Some large US and European investment banking operations are shifting their focus mainly towards domestic clients while adopting a more conservative approach to risk management. Others may continue with aggressive risk-taking within tighter regulations.  In terms of changes related to global banking competition over time, Asian-based domestic-focused financial institutions could potentially step up playing larger roles in intermediating global capital flows alongside other international players.  Turning attention toward currencies, particularly the dollar, the article notes that it currently plays a central role in several key aspects of the global currency system. It is widely used for international trade invoicing and settlement, heavily present in foreign exchange reserves held by sovereign states, serving as a monetary anchor to some currencies, and maintaining deep and liquid capital markets. Additionally, many international investors still value it when monitoring their investment portfolios.  However, investor confidence in the dollar's role has wavered due to the financial crisis originating from US markets and concerns regarding its debtor status. The article highlights that the dollar's central role stems from post-World War II arrangements made under Bretton Woods but suggests that circumstances have changed significantly since then.  The US has become a major debtor nation with implications for its credibility while other nations such as China and India show clear signs of rising geopolitical power over time. As a result, there is growing discussion around whether an alternative currency could emerge to challenge or supplement the dollar's current position.  In short, this news article highlights current challenges faced by banks in the US and Europe due ",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of the Brazilian economy and the measures taken by the government to counteract the impact of the global financial crisis.  The article starts by highlighting that timely government reactions, such as reducing reserve requirements and making credit lines directly available to corporations, have helped Brazil's economy rebound. The stability of the Brazilian financial system is emphasized, along with a strong domestic market and resilient labor market in the first half of this year.  It further states that Brazil's recovery is expected to benefit from improved conditions in developed countries from the third quarter of 2009 onwards. The article points out that Brazil has a relatively closed economy with a large home market. The government's countercyclical measures were successful in mitigating some effects of the financial crisis, although it still had some impact on Brazil.  The diversification of exports is identified as an important change in recent years. Not only has Brazil increased exports to China, but it has also seen growth in trade with other emerging markets in Latin America. As China now accounts for approximately 14 percent of Brazilian exports (up from 6 percent in 2005), it has become just as important as the United States.  The macroeconomic measures implemented by the government are considered largely correct. These include following a fiscal surplus policy and continuously reducing debt since 2003, granting autonomy to their central bank, and building up foreign currency reserves through floating exchange rates.  However, when discussing institutional reforms such as tax progression and labor regulations, there hasn't been much progress yet due to lack of consensus within Brazilian society. Nevertheless, these reforms are seen as crucial for long-term competitiveness.  In terms of infrastructure investments, while there are some delays due to the crisis's impact on funding availability, there remains a favorable outlook for Brazil's infrastructure sector over coming years. The real estate sector is already experiencing strong growth thanks to lower interest rates; agriculture; biotech; alternative energy sectors also hold promise.  The article praises the solidity of the Brazilian banking system, stating that domestic banks have remained well-capitalized and did not face significant liquidity issues. Only small and medium-sized banks, which are more dependent on wholesale and cross-border financing, have been impacted. Credit Suisse is also mentioned as having maintained a strong position throughout the crisis by taking risk reduction measures and diversifying their earnings base.  In conclusion, the article suggests that Brazil's prospects for growth are positive, with opportunities for companies like Credit Suisse to thrive in this environment. It states that Brazil has never been better positioned economically and aims to become one of the best and most admired banks globally. The article further discusses the Brazilian economy's potential for growth and highlights specific sectors that are expected to thrive. One of these sectors is the real estate industry, which has already witnessed significant growth due to lower interest rates. This suggests that there is still plenty of potential for further expansion in this sector.  Additionally, the article mentions agriculture as another promising area of opportunity. Brazil has a thriving agricultural industry and is a major player in global agricultural markets. The country's fertile land, ample water resources, and favorable climate make it well-suited for agricultural production. Furthermore, advancements in biotechnology and alternative energy have opened up new avenues for the agriculture sector to explore.  The renewable energy program involving ethanol as a substitute for oil distillate is highlighted as an example of Brazil's leadership in alternative energy initiatives. This program has gained international attention and showcases Brazil's commitment to sustainable practices.  Regarding the banking system, the article praises Brazil's financial institutions for their resilience during the global credit crisis. The strong capitalization and absence of material liquidity issues among domestic banks indicate that they have weathered the storm relatively well when compared to small-and-medium-sized banks with greater exposure to external financing sources.  Credit Suisse is specifically mentioned as having emerged from the crisis even stronger than before by implementing risk reduction measures and diversifying its earnings base. This success positions Credit Suisse favorably with private clients, corporations, and institutional clients looking at them as their preferred partner.  In conclusion, while there are some areas where reforms are lacking consensus or progress has been slow like tax progression or labor regulations reformations - overall prospects seem positive for Brazil's economic growth trajectory. The country benefits from sound macroeconomic policies implemented by its government including fiscal surplus management since 2003 along with granting autonomy to its central bank which allows building substantial foreign currency reserves through floating exchange rates without being exposed heavily on USD fluctuations.  Moreover, China emerges as a crucial trading partner alongside long-standing relations with the United States. The diversification of exports to different emerging markets has strengthened Brazil's economic position. Despite some delays in infrastructure investments due to the crisis, there remains a favorable outlook for sectors such as real estate, agriculture, biotech, and alternative energy.  Overall, the article paints an optimistic picture of Brazil's economic prospects and emphasizes the country's potential for further growth and resilience in the face of global economic challenges.",explain
"This news article discusses the significance of different sources of energy throughout history, focusing on steam power, crude oil, and hydropower. It highlights various milestones and accidents related to these energy sources.  The article begins by emphasizing the importance of fire in the development of human civilization. The discovery and control of fire allowed humans to migrate to different parts of Earth and facilitated advancements such as metalworking and clay firing. It then traces the history of steam power, starting with Heron of Alexandria's description in 100 B.C. Scottish engineer James Watt later improved on existing designs and patented his version in 1769, which led to the widespread use of steam engines during the Industrial Revolution.  Moving on to crude oil, the article mentions Edwin Drake's successful extraction in 1859 as a significant turning point for industrialization. The invention of electric light bulbs initially lowered demand for oil, but with the advent of automobiles, it became highly sought-after once again. Today, more than one-third of global energy needs are met by oil.  While oil is practical for end-use purposes like heating or refueling vehicles, transportation can be problematic due to potential accidents involving tankers. The article cites two major incidents: one occurred in Europe in 1999 when an oil tanker called Erika broke apart off Brittany’s coast causing considerable pollution; another took place in April 2010 when Deepwater Horizon platform exploded leading to a massive environmental catastrophe in the Gulf region.  The Deepwater Horizon incident resulted in significant media coverage; however, large amounts of oil leak into various bodies around the world due to faulty drilling equipment or pipelines. The Niger delta is specifically highlighted as an area heavily affected by this issue with approximately two billion liters spilled over many years - comparable to Exxon Valdez tanker accident's pollution impact.  Lastly, hydropower is discussed as one of humanity's oldest used sources because ancient civilizations like Greeks and Romans employed water wheels for flour milling. Over time, hydropower played a crucial role in powering machinery in mines, workshops, and factories. The construction of the first hydroelectric power stations in 1880 further expanded the use of this renewable energy source.  While hydropower is considered clean and natural, the article acknowledges that expanding infrastructure to meet growing electricity demand leads to the creation of larger reservoirs and more productive power stations. It concludes by noting that approximately a quarter of global energy is generated through hydropower.  Overall, this article provides an overview of key milestones and accidents related to steam power, crude oil extraction and transportation, as well as the history and environmental considerations associated with hydropower. The article delves deeper into the challenges and consequences associated with different energy sources. It emphasizes how the demand for electricity leads to the construction of larger reservoirs and more powerful hydropower stations, highlighting the need to balance energy generation with environmental considerations.  Additionally, the article highlights that while steam power, crude oil, and hydropower have played significant roles in human civilization's development and progress, they also come with their own set of drawbacks. The accidents mentioned earlier illustrate the potential risks and environmental impact associated with oil spills or other catastrophic incidents.  Furthermore, it mentions that although oil is a practical source of energy at its final point of consumption, transporting it to end consumers poses challenges due to issues like tanker accidents. It emphasizes that even beyond these high-profile accidents, substantial amounts of oil leak into ecosystems around the world due to poorly maintained equipment or infrastructure.  The article points out that such leaks often go unnoticed or are not given as much attention as major accidents but collectively contribute to significant pollution. The ongoing situation in the Niger delta serves as an example where foreign multinationals extracting Nigerian oil over several decades have resulted in vast amounts of spilled oil comparable to major tanker disasters like Exxon Valdez.  By providing historical context and discussing current issues related to these various energy sources, the article prompts readers to consider multiple factors when evaluating their overall impact on society and environment. It highlights how advancements in technology have shaped our modern world but also reminds us of our responsibility towards sustainable energy practices moving forward.  In conclusion, this news article provides a comprehensive overview of major milestones related to steam power, crude oil extraction and transportation as well as hydropower development throughout history. It sheds light on both positive advancements facilitated by these sources while acknowledging their negative aspects such as environmental pollution or risks tied with accidents. By presenting a broad perspective on different energies' contributions and challenges they entail now anticipates readers' considerations for sustainable energy solutions moving forward. ",explain
"This news article provides an overview of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the significant role it plays in the United States economy and global financial systems. The Fed is a central government agency, known as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for controlling all US dollars in circulation and influencing international liquidity.  The article explains that there are seven members on the Board of Governors, each nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. These governors serve a full term of 14 years, ensuring their independence from political pressure. The President also nominates one member to serve as chairman of the Board, who holds considerable power and influence over monetary policy.  The Chairman of the Fed not only oversees its operations but also serves as chairman of another important committee called Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee holds eight meetings per year to discuss interest rate policy and make decisions on whether to raise or lower key interest rates.  The Fed's decisions are crucial not only for domestic monetary policy but also have significant implications internationally. As they control all US dollars in circulation, their actions impact global liquidity levels and can affect currencies worldwide.  The article highlights Alan Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006. Greenspan was widely regarded as a legend during his time at the helm due to his astute analyses and measures regarding monetary policy. His mysterious communication style during FOMC meetings added to his legendary status, often leaving analysts interpreting his words with speculation.  Greenspan's policies contributed to an unprecedented economic boom in America lasting almost a decade between 1992 and 2000—the longest period of sustained growth in American history. He found support among Wall Street brokers who admired him greatly.  Upon stepping down from his position|on January 31, 2006|Alan Greenspan was succeeded by Ben Bernanke—Bush’s economics adviser at that time—who subsequently became the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. The article notes that Bernanke, unlike Greenspan, is an academic and has not previously worked in a free market economy. However, his vast knowledge and expertise make him highly regarded among economists.  The article concludes by emphasizing the uncertainties that lie ahead for Bernanke and highlights the importance of his ability to navigate challenges such as strong inflation or a severe recession. If he succeeds in maintaining economic stability, he can build confidence among markets and stabilize the economy further.  In summary, this news article provides an overview of the Federal Reserve's role in overseeing monetary policy in the United States. It highlights key figures like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke who have held influential positions as Fed chairman and discusses their impact on domestic and global economies. Furthermore, the article underscores the significance of the Federal Reserve's role in maintaining a healthy banking system and a stable economy. The Fed's primary responsibility is to ensure that banks operate soundly and efficiently, minimizing risks to financial stability.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the FOMC, has the power to set interest rates. By adjusting these rates, they can influence borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, thereby affecting spending and investment behaviors that impact economic growth.  Given its immense power over monetary policy and its influence on global economies, every statement made by the Fed chairman carries substantial weight. Investors closely scrutinize their remarks for hints on future policy decisions or shifts in economic sentiment. This interest is evident from brokers hanging onto Alan Greenspan's every word throughout his tenure as chairman.  Alan Greenspan was renowned not only for his expertise in economics but also for his enigmatic communication style during FOMC meetings. He intentionally chose cryptic language at times, leaving it up to market participants to interpret his messages accurately—a strategy that added an air of mystique around him.  Despite Greenspan's penchant for secrecy within FOMC meetings, he was widely acknowledged as one of history's most influential central bankers—referred to by some as the greatest Fed chairman ever. His policies were credited with fostering sustained economic growth during his tenure.  Following Alan Greenspan's departure in 2006 came Ben Bernanke—the man tasked with stepping into these sizeable shoes as chairman of the Federal Reserve. While differing from Greenspan in professional background – being an academic rather than having experience within free markets – Bernanke was well-regarded among economists due to his extensive knowledge and expertise.  The article mentions that Bernanke had been serving on the Board of Governors since 2002 before being appointed as chairman by President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2005 ahead of taking office early next year. The author highlights Bernanke's strength as a specialist, making him untouchable in that regard.  Despite the recognition of Bernanke's capabilities, uncertainties lie ahead for his tenure. The article cites the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which predicts that volatile challenges are on the horizon. As chairman of the Fed, Bernanke will be tasked with maintaining a delicate balance between managing inflation and avoiding a severe recession. Successfully navigating such hurdles will enable him to inspire confidence in both markets and the broader economy.  In conclusion, this news article offers insight into the Federal Reserve's crucial role in shaping monetary policy within the United States while influencing global financial systems. It discusses influential figures like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke – former and current Fed chairs – emphasizing their impact on economic stability and prosperity. Additionally, it acknowledges uncertainties surrounding Bernanke’s leadership during testing times but also highlights his vast knowledge as an asset to overcome upcoming challenges effectively.",explain

Kuhn discusses various aspects of his coaching career, including media coverage, public recognition, the World Cup experience, his coaching philosophy, upcoming matches, player selection for EURO 2008, and performance assessments.  Kuhn begins by reflecting on how the media paid little attention to the Swiss Under-21 team initially. However, he believed that if they performed well and gained recognition through their efforts on the field, people would start taking notice. He credits not only the players and coaches but also the support from organizations like the Swiss Football Association and sponsor Credit Suisse for contributing to football's popularity in Switzerland.  When asked about receiving awards or recognition in his career as a coach, Kuhn states that it is pleasing to be recognized by peers but believes all awards hold equal value. He respects the choices of the Swiss public who voted for him and acknowledges that they have knowledge about football comparable to any other nation.  Kuhn recalls one memorable moment during his coaching career when thousands of fans gathered to cheer on Switzerland before a World Cup match against Togo. He describes it as an incredible experience that gave them a huge boost.  Regarding changes in football over time with increased media coverage of major events like the World Cup, Kuhn says he sees this as a positive development rather than a negative one. The widespread attention helps athletes realize what it truly means to participate at such high levels.  In terms of his personal journey as a coach after retiring from playing in 1977, Kuhn explains that while he pursued coaching quickly after retirement and worked with young players throughout his career in Zurich and later with the Swiss Football Association since 1996. His primary focus has always been working with young talent rather than aiming for ambitious goals like winning championships or titles.  Speaking about assessing players' potential before selecting them for matches, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of expecting a strong performance from the team as a whole. He mentions that in 2006, during his tenure, each player had the desire to give their best on the field consistently.  In preparation for EURO 2008, Kuhn requested the Swiss Football Association to organize international matches against high-quality opponents and is pleased with their fulfillment of this request. While results ultimately matter, he believes in attracting spectators with attractive football rather than resorting to defensive tactics.  Kuhn discusses how preparation for major tournaments like EURO 2008 involves meeting frequently with players. In addition to his role, other medical and training staff are necessary to monitor and improve players' performances. Though they rely on tests conducted by individual clubs, they conduct assessments every few months to address any remaining areas of improvement before EURO 2008.  When asked about finalizing the squad for EURO 2008, Kuhn explains that until selection day arrives, there is always a possibility for new talents to emerge or unforeseen circumstances like injuries. He mentions specific players like Pirmin Schwegler and Julian Esteban as potential candidates.  In conclusion, this article presents insights from Jakob Kuhn's coaching career perspective on media attention, public recognition, World Cup experiences, coaching philosophy principles involving attractive football tactics rather than defensive ones in upcoming games leading up until EURO 2008 selections are finalized while remaining open towards new talent possibilities.

"This news article discusses the current state of the real estate markets in the United States and the United Kingdom. It suggests that both countries are experiencing a slowdown in residential property prices, but there is still potential for investment opportunities in commercial properties.  In the United States, there has been a construction boom over the past five years, particularly in states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Washington DC. This surge in construction was driven by low supply, growth in employment, expansionist monetary policy, and households redirecting their investments from stock markets to housing. However, sales volumes of newly constructed and existing houses have declined this year compared to last year. Median house prices have also leveled off after significant growth in 2004. Despite this slowdown, Zoltan Szelyes from Credit Suisse Research predicts a ""soft landing"" rather than a significant price fall.  In the UK, residential housing prices have remained buoyant for several years due to socio-demographic developments. Between 1996 and 2004, cumulative prices rose by 260 percent and have revived again this year despite a slowdown in 2005. Factors such as continued migration increasing demand for housing and a decrease in household size have contributed to this trend.  However, while both countries may be experiencing slower price growth or stability in residential property markets, Szelyes believes that it will not necessarily drag down their respective economies. He suggests that real estate's impact on consumption is overestimated and that income dynamics and employment growth should remain steady next year.  On the other hand, there are still plenty of investment opportunities available for commercial properties worldwide if one knows where to look. Some parts of Asia (Singapore & Tokyo), Eastern Europe (Poland & Czech Republic), Western Europe (German cities), and even Australia (due to high immigration) offer potential rewards for those interested in commercial real estate investments.  The article also discusses Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as a popular option for investors in the real estate market. REITs allow small investors to participate in the equity ownership of real estate while distributing tax-exempt profits to shareholders. The popularity and potential of REITs are demonstrated by the recent 36 billion dollar buy-out of Equity Office Properties Trust by Blackstone Group.  In summary, while residential property prices may be stabilizing or slowing down in both the US and UK, there are still opportunities for commercial real estate investments worldwide. Szelyes suggests caution when investing in economically volatile countries but highlights potential dynamics and higher yields in regions like Eastern Europe, particularly Romania and Bulgaria. Furthermore, the rise of Real Estate Investment Trusts has made indirect investment opportunities more accessible to small investors around the globe. The article emphasizes that real estate investments have gained significant recognition as a highly regarded asset class since the mid-1990s. Alongside traditional direct investments, there are now various indirect investment opportunities available, which help eliminate potential disadvantages like low liquidity and lack of transparency.  One popular option for investors is the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) structure. REITs were created by a 1960 US act of Congress and allow small investors to participate in the equity ownership of real estate. One advantage of REITs is that they are not allowed to invest in riskier development projects, which provides some level of stability for investors. Additionally, they distribute tax-exempt profits to shareholders.  REITs have rapidly gained popularity and spread worldwide. Since 1994, the combined market capitalization has grown more than five times over. The success and potential of REITs can be observed through recent events such as Blackstone Group's acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust for $36 billion – which was the largest owner of office buildings in the United States at that time.  Looking ahead, it is expected that REIT structures will continue to expand globally. In fact, they are set to be introduced in the UK next year, further opening up opportunities for small investor participation in real estate ownership.  The article also highlights specific regions where commercial property markets are showing signs of revival or growth potential. German cities, Swedish cities, French cities, Spanish cities, and British cities all demonstrate increased activity within their office property markets combined with strong economic growth. This suggests an accelerated real estate market situation primarily due to limited supply meeting robust demand.  Moreover, Eastern Europe also possesses great prospects for commercial real estate investment due to its relatively limited supply alongside strong economic growth trends. However,Szelyes advises cautiousness when investing in economically volatile countries like Hungary while recommending focusing on Poland and the Czech Republic instead.  In conclusion,the news article points out that while residential property markets might be experiencing a slowdown, there are still potential investment opportunities in commercial real estate globally. Real estate prices might stabilize or decelerate, but it is unlikely to have a severe adverse impact on the overall economy. Additionally, the popularity and growth of REITs further highlight the feasibility of indirect real estate investments for small investors.",explain
"This news article discusses the findings of the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, which provides insights into global household wealth and its distribution. The report, published in October 2010, examines the development of household wealth over the past decade across more than 200 countries. Unlike other publications that focus on rich lists, this report looks at the wealth of all 4.4 billion adults worldwide.  The key highlight mentioned in the article is that a particular segment of individuals currently holds 32 percent of global household wealth, and it is expected to grow rapidly. This indicates a high concentration of wealth among a smaller portion of society. The report also delves into various aspects such as social structures influencing wealth distribution, demographic changes, gender issues, and urbanization trends.  One interesting feature highlighted in the Global Wealth Report is the presence of what they call a ""wealth pyramid."" Within this pyramid structure, there are approximately one billion adults residing within its middle segment. These individuals possess assets ranging from USD 10,000 to USD 100,000 collectively. Experts suggest that this large group represents an immense opportunity for growing consumer markets globally.  The authors responsible for the report also express interest in identifying short-term opportunities while simultaneously considering long-term prospects within emerging markets such as Asia (including China and India), Latin America, Turkey and Indonesia. They believe these countries hold potential for mid-range and upper-end products that will cater to consumers' preferences.  Despite leading markets like Europe, Japan and America facing financial crises during recent times mentioned in this article emerge market countries such as China and India were able to adapt effectively to external shocks due to their economic flexibility.The former US Ambassador to India highlights India's unique advantage with its large internal private sector economy rather than being heavily reliant on exports.  Experts also attribute Asia's dynamism partially to young generations who have not witnessed or feared political crises like war or revolution but are instead focused on consumption and prestige - highlighting China's post-war generation as an example. These individuals are part of the first consumer generation and often have access to higher education and better salaries, which contributes to their increasing spending power.  The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom emphasizes the fierce competition young Europeans will face from Latin America and Asia. He argues that young people in these regions possess a strong determination to succeed, driven by their desire to escape poverty and ensure they do not regress back into it.  To summarize, this news article provides an overview of the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report's key findings. It showcases the concentration of global household wealth among a smaller segment while identifying growth opportunities within emerging markets. The authors also analyze social structures, demographic changes, gender issues, and urbanization trends as factors influencing wealth distribution. Additionally, experts highlight Asia's dynamism resulting from political stability and a growing consumer-driven market fueled by younger generations' consumption patterns. In addition to the key points mentioned earlier, the article also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and responding to the intense competition that young Europeans will face from regions like Latin America and Asia. The article highlights that young people in these areas have a strong determination to succeed, driven by their experiences of poverty and their desire to avoid falling back into it.  The shift in global economic power towards emerging markets like China and India is evident from the report's findings. While traditional leading markets such as Europe, Japan, and the United States struggled with financial crises, these emerging economies were able to weather external shocks more effectively due to their ability to adapt. This resilience presents a promising opportunity for multinational companies based in Europe and America who can tap into growing consumer markets in Asia.  Furthermore, it is interesting to note that this report takes into account factors beyond mere wealth distribution. It analyzes social structures influencing wealth disparities, demographic changes such as population growth or aging populations, gender issues related to inequality between men and women within households when it comes to owning assets or accessing wealth opportunities, as well as urbanization trends which highlight shifts in wealth accumulation patterns across cities.  The Global Wealth Report's focus on understanding all aspects of household wealth for all adults worldwide provides a comprehensive view of global economic dynamics. By examining assets held by households across various countries over a decade-long period starting from 2000 until 2010 when this report was published - Credit Suisse aims not only at providing insights into current wealth distribution but also at identifying potential future trends.  The concept of the ""wealth pyramid"" introduced in this report unveils an enormous opportunity for businesses looking for mid-range and high-end consumer markets particularly within countries where individuals fall within the middle segment of USD 10,000-USD 100,000 worth of assets. This segment constitutes one billion adults globally who represent potential consumers interested in various products and services prevalent today.  By grasping short-term opportunities while keeping an eye on the long-term prospects of emerging markets, companies can align their strategies with the expected rise in wealth and income among the middle segment of the wealth pyramid. This not only benefits businesses within those countries but also presents opportunities for multinational corporations based in Europe and America to tap into these growing consumer markets.  Overall, as highlighted by the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, young Europeans need to be aware of and prepared to face intense competition from regions like Latin America and Asia. The article concludes on a note that young people in these areas are determined to succeed, driven by their personal experiences of poverty and their aspirations for a better future. Understanding the changing global dynamics, capitalizing on emerging markets' potential, and adapting strategies accordingly will be crucial for individuals, businesses, and economies alike.",explain
"This news article discusses the potential growth and opportunities in the satellite internet industry. It highlights various initiatives and investments being made by companies in different countries to expand access to high-speed internet through satellite technology.  One of the key projects mentioned is the ""Digital France 2012"" initiative, which aims to provide internet access to every household in France by 2012, even in areas where cable connections are not available. Eutelset, Europe's second-largest satellite operator, plans to play a significant role in this project by offering its Tooway™ internet service.  Swisscom, a telecommunications company in Switzerland, also intends to offer satellite internet as a complement to its existing broadband solutions. This move will help them fulfill their obligation of providing basic services across the country, including mountainous regions.  Satellite service providers have traditionally focused on TV and video-on-demand offerings. However, with the increasing demand for high-quality transmission and the rise of payTV broadcasters globally, there is now an opportunity for these operators to expand into providing internet services as well.  Media companies, television broadcasters, and even telecom firms have been major buyers of transmission capacity from satellites. SES (Europe's biggest satellite operator) has successfully offered its IP-Prime product to US telecom firms since July last year. Europe's duopoly of satellite operators - Eutelsat and SES - have similar plans for Europe using their own products like KA-SAT and ASTRA2Connect. They estimate a potential market size of 15-30 million households that could be served more competitively with superior quality through satellite internet instead of traditional copper-wire networks.  While there are initial challenges such as higher equipment costs for customers interested in satellite-based internet services and niche markets due to specific needs like mobile telephony services requiring large bandwidths; there is still significant potential for growth.The use of satellites can provide cost-efficient opportunities for mobile telephony services by transmitting TV,internet, video and music content to mobile devices via terrestrial DVB-H or DVB-SH networks. This opens up possibilities for combining services with navigational and locational information (GPS) and enables the development of new and innovative services in this field.  The article suggests that satellite operators are likely to perform well despite economic downturns due to relatively stable long-term customer agreements for transmission services. It also mentions that demand outpaces supply, allowing for potential price increases.  Overall, the article emphasizes the growing interest in satellite internet services from various sectors such as telecommunications, media, and television companies. It highlights how satellite technology can help bridge the digital divide by providing internet access in areas without traditional cable infrastructure. The sector's defensive investment potential is also mentioned because of its relatively stable nature compared to other industries. Additionally, the article mentions that satellite operators are expected to benefit from a deteriorating economic environment due to their very long-term customer agreements. These agreements provide transparency in future income streams and offer stability even during uncertain times. Furthermore, the satellite industry is characterized by a lack of overcapacity, meaning that demand for satellite services far exceeds supply.  Although the industry requires significant capital investment and often carries high levels of debt, refinancing is secured over the long term. This provides reassurance for investors and allows companies in this sector to pass on price increases when necessary.  However, despite these positive prospects outlined in the article, it suggests that the market may not fully recognize these opportunities yet. The potential for growth in satellite internet services has not been fully acknowledged by investors or consumers.  The article concludes by highlighting that investing in satellite operators within this relatively defensive sector could be a wise choice. With technology advancements driving demand for high-quality transmission and access to high-speed internet across various industries, there is significant room for growth and profitability.  In summary, this news article discusses various initiatives and investments being made in the field of satellite internet services. It highlights projects such as ""Digital France 2012"" aiming to provide universal internet access in France and Swisscom's plan to offer satellite-based broadband solutions as a complement to its existing offerings. The article also emphasizes how traditional television broadcasters are expanding into offering additional online content through satellite technology.  Furthermore, it notes that mobile telephony services can benefit substantially from utilizing satellites as they enable cost-efficient transmission of television channels along with other multimedia content directly to mobile devices without requiring expensive bandwidths through traditional networks.  The growth potential of offering internet services via satellites is recognized but still considered niche due to initial equipment costs and specific market demands like mobile telephony needs. However, it underlines that investing in this sector can be attractive due to its stable nature compared with other industries during difficult economic conditions.  Overall, as advances in technology continue to drive demand for high-speed internet access and superior transmission quality across various sectors, satellite operators are positioned to play a significant role in meeting these needs and capitalizing on the market potential.",explain

"This news article discusses the success and impact of the cashless money transfer system called M-Pesa in Kenya. M-Pesa is a service operated by Safaricom, the leading cell phone company in Kenya, that allows users to transfer money using their mobile devices. The article highlights how M-Pesa has revolutionized payment methods in Kenya and even other parts of Africa.  The article begins by explaining that M-Pesa offers a convenient and easy way for Kenyans to pay for purchases, transportation, and services using their mobile phones. It emphasizes that this system has become more accessible than traditional methods of payment found in major cities around the world. The name ""M-Pesa"" originates from combining ""mobile"" with ""pesa,"" which means money in Swahili, one of Kenya's national languages.  The success of M-Pesa started eight years ago when many Kenyans already owned mobile phones with Safaricom numbers. The creators of M-Pesa recognized this opportunity and turned these phone numbers into virtual bank accounts. Users could upload money to their phone and send it to other Safaricom customers within minutes. This service quickly gained popularity, resulting in millions of active users within months.  Today, there are over 20 million registered customers who can use more than 83,000 agents across cities and rural areas for uploading, sending or receiving money through M-Pesa.  However, transferring money between cell phones is just one aspect of what M-Pesa can do now. Users can also pay utility bills (electricity and water), withdraw cash from ATMs using their M-Pesa account balance as well as buy airline tickets or concert tickets directly from their mobile phones. Furthermore,M- Pess encourages saving by offering savings accounts through partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa; interest rates start at 2 percent up to a certain amount.  Mention is made about how important the system is to Kenya's economy; transactions via M-Pesa represent 39 percent of the country's GDP. The success of M-Pesa has inspired its expansion into other countries such as Tanzania, Egypt, Afghanistan, India, and several others in Africa. In fact, it has even been introduced in Romania as a trial market for Europe.  The article also notes that while banks initially viewed M-Pesa as competition and fought against it, they eventually recognized the opportunities it presented. Banks have now come on board with supporting M-Pesa by enabling transfers to M-Pesa accounts and facilitating the system's savings and loan functions.  The article concludes by highlighting individuals like Billy Warero who use M-Pesa for various financial transactions such as paying bills or shopping at supermarkets. It emphasizes how the banking industry has benefited from this revolution by allowing customers to transfer funds between their bank accounts and M-Pesa accounts.  Overall, this news article provides an overview of how M-Pesa has transformed money transfer and payment methods in Kenya through mobile phone technology. It shows that this electronic payment system is not only convenient but also essential to many Kenyans' financial activities. The article goes on to explain that M-Pesa has had a significant impact on the economy of Kenya. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, the value of all transactions made through M-Pesa between June 2013 and June 2014 accounted for 39 percent of the country's GDP. This highlights how integral M-Pesa has become in facilitating financial transactions and contributing to economic growth.  The success and potential of M-Pesa have not gone unnoticed beyond Kenya. The article states that Safaricom has expanded its operations by introducing M-Pesa in other African countries such as Tanzania, Egypt, Afghanistan, India, and plans to expand further into Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It even mentions that Vodafone exported M-Pesa to Romania as a test market for Europe.  This global expansion demonstrates the value and applicability of mobile money transfer systems like M-Pesa across different regions with varying levels of financial inclusion. It offers a solution for individuals who previously had limited access to banking services or faced challenges with traditional payment methods.  The article also highlights how M-Pesa has empowered rural Kenyans who previously had few banking options. These individuals have transitioned from relying solely on agriculture-based income into embracing digital financial services provided by mobile technology. By enabling them to transfer money easily from one cell phone to another and pay their bills or access loans digitally, M-Pesa has bridged the gap between these communities and mainstream financial services.  Furthermore, there is an emphasis on how users are encouraged to save through their participation in this system. Safaricom's partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa allows customers to open savings accounts via their mobile phones. This inclusionary approach not only promotes financial literacy but also provides an opportunity for individuals who may have never earned interest before in their lives.  As mentioned earlier in the article regarding Billy Warero's experience using M-Pesa for various transactions instead of going to the bank, it highlights how even though banks initially viewed M-Pesa as a competitor, they have now integrated their services with the mobile payment system. This shows that traditional financial institutions have recognized the value and convenience of digital payment systems like M-Pesa and have adapted accordingly.  In conclusion, the article portrays M-Pesa as a groundbreaking and highly successful electronic payment system that has transformed the way people in Kenya conduct financial transactions. It emphasizes how this mobile money transfer service has not only provided convenience but also improved access to financial services for individuals in both urban and rural areas. With its widespread adoption in Kenya and expansion into other countries, M-Pesa is not just a local success story but a global example of how technological innovation can bring about meaningful changes in financial inclusion and economic development.",explain
"This news article discusses the pressing need to make significant changes in the approach to sustainable economic development in order to address various global crises and challenges. It highlights that with the world's population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, along with financial crises, growing inequalities, rising carbon emissions, and degraded natural ecosystems, humanity's ecological footprint is reaching its limits.  The article states that while international binding rules would be beneficial in transitioning towards a green economy, it is unlikely that treaties leading to international law will be achieved at the Rio summit. Therefore, it emphasizes the importance of collective efforts between governments, businesses, scientists, politicians, and the world's population. Clear government policies and long-term incentives are necessary for corporations to become part of the solution and take leadership in advancing a green economy.  It mentions that there is an increasing trend of corporations adopting more sustainable business practices due to political urging and as a response to global financial crises and recent natural disasters. The article specifically mentions Credit Suisse as an example of a company that has prioritized environmental and social considerations for over ten years. It highlights their ISO 14001-certified environmental management system which helps them use resources efficiently and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Credit Suisse's Green Business Initiative is also highlighted as an effort to promote renewable energy and cleantech products/services within their organization. The bank also conducts internal risk review processes for transactions with clients who may pose environmental or social risks according to their own policies for sensitive industries.  The article emphasizes that sustainable investing should be integrated into every investment decision process while considering sustainability-related investment risks. In line with this commitment towards sustainability, Credit Suisse launched its ""Sustainability Outlook on Rio+20 - Expected Impacts on the Economic System"" report prior to Rio+20 summit. This report explores key themes such as sustainable water management food security agriculture oceans' conservation etc., advising on politically-induced growth potential within these areas at Rio+20. The report also explores different funding scenarios for sustainable development policies and identifies potential models such as impact investing. It suggests aligning funding mobilization with global economic recovery, including lifting subsidies and tariffs that hinder investment and market potential.  In addition to the initiatives taken by Credit Suisse, the article mentions the Global ""50:50"" initiative launched by the World Bank Group. This initiative brings together public and private sector institutions to jointly support factoring natural capital into decision making.  The article concludes by acknowledging that although Rio+20 may not produce tangible measures immediately, it is an opportunity for transformative action from local governments and businesses. Just as Earth Summit 1992 set a blueprint for sustainable development in the 21st century, there is hope that Rio+20 will catalyze meaningful action on the ground rather than relying solely on international declarations and treaties.  Overall, this news article emphasizes the urgent need for a shift towards a green economy due to various global challenges. It highlights corporate efforts such as those made by Credit Suisse but also emphasizes collective actions involving governments, businesses, scientists, politicians, and individuals in order to achieve sustainability goals.",explain

"The news article discusses the resurgence of vinyl records in the music industry. It highlights how vinyl, once considered obsolete with the rise of CDs, has experienced a surprising comeback in recent years.  The article starts by mentioning that vinyl sales have been steadily increasing for eight consecutive years in the US. In contrast, CD sales have seen a decline. According to Nielsen SoundScan, vinyl sales were up 46 percent in the first eight months of 2014 compared to the previous year, while CD sales declined by 19 percent during the same period.  The popularity of vinyl is further emphasized by Jack White's album ""Lazaretto,"" which became the best-selling vinyl record since Pearl Jam's ""Vitalogy"" released in 1994. Around 67,000 vinyl copies were sold, accounting for 25 percent of its total US sales. Despite these successes, however, it is important to note that vinyl still represents only about 6.5 percent of the overall music market and remains far smaller than CDs.  Interestingly, independent record stores have become instrumental in driving this resurgence. The article mentions stores like Brooklyn's Permanent Records and San Francisco's Amoeba Music selling about two-thirds of total vinyl records in the US. Record Store Day has also played a significant role by allowing music stores to celebrate and promote vinyl through special releases.  Large retailers such as f.y.e and Target have also recognized this trend and are actively promoting and selling turntables alongside their other products. Major labels are getting involved too by releasing new albums on vinyl format—an occurrence not seen since the '90s.  Artists themselves are utilizing vinyl as an avenue for increased revenue. They can charge more for physical records compared to digital downloads and use special releases or promotions linked with their albums' physical editions to engage fans more effectively.  The article attributes consumer demand as a driving force behind this revival. Audiophiles appreciate that listening to music on vinyl offers superior sound quality to modern, data-compressed audio formats like mp3. Mainstream music buyers are also seeking the joy of owning a physical record collection and appreciating the artwork and packaging that accompanies vinyl records. This experience is often lost in streaming or digital purchases.  In conclusion, vinyl records have experienced a remarkable comeback in the music industry. Despite its small market share compared to CDs, vinyl sales have been steadily increasing for several years. Independent record stores, special events like Record Store Day, and the support of major retailers have played crucial roles in driving this resurgence. Artists have also recognized the potential benefits of releasing albums on vinyl format—not just for nostalgia but also as a means to generate higher revenue. Ultimately, it is consumer demand that is fueling this trend, with individuals seeking out the richer sound quality and overall experience that can be found through vinyl records. The article goes on to mention that vinyl sales have provided a much-needed boost for artists and retailers in a challenging market. The music industry has been grappling with declining digital sales, as online purchases of music fell for the first time in 2013 due to the rise of streaming services. This trend continued in 2014, with digital sales falling by 13 percent through August.  Vinyl has emerged as an unexpected ally for artists and retailers because it offers a physical format that fans are willing to pay more for. This is especially advantageous for independent artists who can showcase their creativity through unique vinyl packaging and special releases tied to their albums. By doing so, they can stimulate their fan base and generate additional revenue.  Notably, the popularity of vinyl is not solely driven by classic rock bands from the past when LPs were dominant. Contemporary artists like Arctic Monkeys, Beck, The Black Keys, and Lana Del Rey have also seen significant success with vinyl releases.  Moreover, nearly every major label is now releasing new albums on vinyl format—something that had not happened since the '90s when CDs took over. This further demonstrates how prevalent this trend has become across the industry.  While vinyl's resurgence is undoubtedly impressive, it is important to note that it still represents only a small fraction of overall music sales. In fact, at just 6.5 percent of the CD market size in terms of units sold (approximately 5.6 million records through August), it falls far short of offsetting the challenges faced by the struggling music industry.  However, despite its relatively small market share compared to digital formats or even CDs, vinyl's growth holds significant value beyond just numbers and percentages. Its re-emergence highlights consumers' desire for a more tangible music experience—one that provides superior sound quality and allows them to appreciate album artwork and packaging.  In conclusion, though still representing a relatively small portion of the overall music market size-wise, vinyl has managed to defy expectations and experience a notable comeback in recent years. Independent record stores, special events like Record Store Day, and the support of major retailers have all played their part in fueling this resurgence. Artists have found new opportunities for revenue generation through vinyl releases. The revival is largely driven by consumer demand for a more immersive music experience that values sound quality and the physicality of owning records. As a result, vinyl has become an important ally for artists and retailers looking to navigate an increasingly challenging music landscape.",explain

"The article discusses the economic situation in Argentina and criticizes President Cristina Kirchner's government for not addressing the root causes of the country's economic problems. According to a report by Credit Suisse analysts, the government is only alleviating the symptoms of economic malaise rather than implementing measures to solve them.  The primary problem in Argentina is out-of-control inflation. The government's current approach does not include tightening fiscal policy enough to curb inflation. The heavy public spending and subsidies provided by the government are fueling consumer price rises, which will lead Argentina back into a cycle of economic instability. The analysts predict that by the end of this year, Argentina might have to go through another devaluation, this time larger than before.  The report highlights that Argentina's current economic situation is unsustainable due to an improvised and uncoordinated approach by the government. Instead of addressing underlying causes, they have targeted symptoms like declining reserves. However, it was actually government policies that triggered this decline in reserves, not vice versa.  Foreign investment has been dampened due to actions such as expropriating private company assets, including Spanish oil company Repsol's operations in 2012. Additionally, since its default on international debt in 2001, Argentina has been locked out of international debt markets and forced to use foreign reserves for imports and debt repayment.  Reserves have significantly dropped from over $52 billion in 2010 to $30.6 billion in 2013. Credit Suisse predicts further plummeting with reserves projected at $22.1 billion this year and $15.7 billion in 2015.  The devaluation carried out by the government on January 22 and 23 was seen as a step in the right direction but merely provides temporary relief unless exports increase significantly after March or April when grains and oilseeds harvest begins bringing more dollars into the economy.  To tackle inflation, restrictions on individuals purchasing dollars for savings purposes were relaxed, as a black market for dollars had emerged due to tight currency controls. However, it is believed that dollar outflows have become more restricted since the devaluation, adding pressure on the parallel exchange rate and reserves.  The government plans to negotiate with labor unions in March and keep wage increases at a minimum to control inflation. However, these measures are seen as temporary solutions rather than addressing the root causes of inflation.  Credit Suisse expects inflation to reach 40% this year compared to 28.4% last year. If reserves continue to dwindle below $25 billion by year-end, another devaluation of around 30% might be necessary in the fourth quarter. This could lead to increased social and political tensions and further contraction of the economy.  The article also warns about falling reserves increasing the risk that Argentina may not be able to pay its creditors in 2015. While debt is manageable this year, next year's costs will amount to 56.4% of Credit Suisse's forecast for foreign reserves.  Overall, the article suggests that Argentina's current economic situation is concerning and criticizes the government for failing to address underlying causes or implement sustainable solutions.",explain
"This news article discusses the European Union's ability to accept new members and its ongoing institutional reforms. The European Parliament has asked the Commission to comment on the EU's ability to expand geographically and accept new members by the end of 2006. However, it notes that the future of the EU Constitutional Treaty, which would have provided new decision-making mechanisms, is uncertain.  As the EU grows in size, it becomes more challenging for it to make decisions, particularly in foreign policy. Therefore, it is crucial for the EU to improve its decision-making mechanisms. This process is currently underway.  The article also mentions that there are mixed feelings towards the EU. Some perceive it as a threat when it is strong. However, the author disagrees with this view since all member countries of the EU are democracies and market economies whose decisions align with their system of values.  Switzerland is highlighted as a partner in a bilateral relationship with the EU that depends on its ability to act as a party to agreements and negotiations. The Swiss government acknowledges that reducing social and economic inequalities in an enlarged EU contributes not only to Europe's security but also to Switzerland's prosperity.  However, any decision regarding Switzerland's relationship with the EU will have to wait until at least 2014-2020 when approval for the EU budget takes place—a delay of at least ten years from when this article was written.  The criteria for negotiations between Switzerland and the EU are already clear, encompassing high legal standards. Although negotiations are ongoing regarding their final outcome concerning Switzerland's relationship with Europe, no speculation can be made yet about what this means specifically for Switzerland.  Nevertheless, Switzerland already has close ties with both politically and economically important partners within Europe through various treaties such as free trade agreements and bilateral agreements I and II—18 vital treaties in total—which protect Swiss interests.  For this bilateral path between Switzerland and Europe to be successful requires shared responsibility from both sides. Potential referendums on Swiss contributions to an enlarged EU are mentioned, and the hope is that the Swiss people will continue to support this bilateral path.  The article also mentions Switzerland's historical efforts in supporting Eastern European countries since the 1990s by helping them introduce reforms and transition into democracies and social market economies. Switzerland has been providing aid to future EU member states Romania and Bulgaria for a long time, particularly as part of its assistance towards Eastern Europe.  The economic treaties Switzerland has with these countries will be replaced by bilateral treaties with the EU once they become members. For example, existing free trade agreements between Switzerland and accession states like Romania and Bulgaria would be replaced by the Switzerland-EU Free Trade Treaty on their accession dates.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of various aspects related to the European Union's ability to accept new members, ongoing institutional reforms within the EU, concerns about decision-making mechanisms in foreign policy, sentiments towards the EU in general, Switzerland's relationship with Europe through bilateral agreements, potential referendums on Swiss contributions to an enlarged EU, and support provided by both sides toward Eastern European countries.",explain
"The news article discusses the Lampo2, a prototype electric sports car developed by Protoscar SA in Rovio, Switzerland. The purpose of the vehicle is to showcase what can already be achieved in terms of electric mobility and demonstrate that it is not just a niche solution but a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.  The Lampo2 is not intended for series production but serves as an impressive demonstration of what electric vehicles are capable of. As a prototype, it is suitable for everyday traffic and ready to drive. Its predecessor, the original Lampo, was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show and received international acclaim. Over 12,000 kilometers of testing have been conducted on the vehicle since then.  According to Marco Piffaretti, Managing Director of Protoscar SA, they aim to prove that electric mobility is efficient and even more enjoyable than conventional cars. Additionally, they seek to highlight Swiss innovation by sourcing key components from local companies.  For instance, Brusa Elektronik AG in Sennwald supplied various components such as batteries, electric engines, chargers, and performance electronics. The inclusion of Swiss-made parts emphasizes their commitment to supporting local industries.  The Lampo2 has several notable features. It is a two-seater sports car weighing approximately 1.6 tons. Unlike its predecessor's rear-wheel drive system configuration, the new model boasts four-wheel drive with one electric engine at each axle. This arrangement enables better torque distribution and enhances overall performance.  With its upgraded powertrain setup compared to its predecessor's generation (now offering 408 horsepower), the Lampo2 demonstrates impressive power output right from spin-off (around 4,500 rotations per minute). This characteristic reflects one advantage typical for electric vehicles - immediate torque delivery from standstill. Despite having only one gear due to its all-electric nature, the driving performance remains remarkable. It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just five seconds and reaches a maximum speed of 200 km/h.  In terms of range, the Lampo2 can travel approximately 200 kilometers using two lithium-ion batteries with a combined power output of 16 kWh. Charging options for the vehicle are flexible and efficient. Four charging modes are available, providing versatility to suit different situations.  The first mode involves regular charging through a domestic socket, which takes around twelve hours for a full charge. At public stations, double the current can be supplied, halving the charging time compared to regular sockets. Industrial connections enable triple the current flow, resulting in an even faster charging experience.  Lastly, an external quick-charge system is available for urgent situations. In just ten minutes of charging, enough electricity is supplied to drive about one hundred kilometers.   The world premiere of the Lampo2 will occur at e'mobile's stand in Geneva. The presentation will also include innovative approaches to charge systems that complement Protoscar's commitment to showcasing sustainable technologies.  Credit Suisse is sponsoring this project not only because they believe it is vital to invest in innovation but also due to their awareness of corporate responsibility towards supporting sustainable technologies.  In conclusion, the article highlights Protoscar SA's latest achievement - the Lampo2 electric sports car prototype - which serves as a strong statement about what electric vehicles are capable of achieving. It demonstrates that electric mobility is not just limited to niche purposes but offers efficiency and enjoyment as well. Swiss innovation plays a significant role as local companies supply essential components for this vehicle prototype. With impressive power output and performance capabilities along with flexible charging options, Protoscar aims to change perceptions surrounding electric mobility technology and showcase its potential benefits on both individual and societal levels.",explain
"The news article discusses the recent World Future Energy Summit held in Abu Dhabi, where representatives from various companies, including Siemens, ABB, Applied Materials, and Oerlikon, gathered to discuss the future of renewable energy and environmental technology. The event also saw the participation of prominent politicians such as EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce.  The conference was notable for being held in Masdar City – an ecocity located in Abu Dhabi. Masdar City is known for being the world's first carbon-dioxide-neutral city with zero waste generation and self-sufficiency in energy production. The city aims to accommodate 50,000 residents and up to 90,000 workers. The emirate of Abu Dhabi has planned to invest $15 billion into this project with an additional $7 billion raised from private investors.  Despite the decline in oil prices and resulting economic challenges faced by the oil-rich emirate, Abu Dhabi remains committed to its plans for Masdar City. Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the Masdar operating company reassures that when they decided to build Masdar back in 2006 with oil prices at $44 a barrel (similarly low as today), they were undeterred.  Abu Dhabi also intends to position itself as a global center for renewable energy sources by increasing its proportion of renewable energy from virtually zero to 7% by 2020. The emirate aims to forge partnerships with various companies and governments worldwide. During the conference, agreements were made between Masdar and General Electric as well as Swiss Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger for establishing centers representing their respective countries' interests within Masdar City.  Masdar's international collaboration extends beyond businesses; it also includes governmental institutions such as embassies. The Swiss Embassy plans on relocating from Abu Dhabi to become the first foreign embassy within Masdar City due to strong Swiss involvement since its early stages of development.  Moreover, global financial institutions like Credit Suisse are managing funds dedicated to green investments. Credit Suisse manages the Masdar Cleantech Private Equity Fund worth $250 million, strategically investing in green economy companies.  Masdar City's influence extends further with it forging alliances with German energy group E.on to build major renewable energy installations. The first collaborative project is the London Array wind farm off the coast of England. On another front, Masdar reached an agreement with the Basque regional government to establish a joint venture for manufacturing components needed in concentrated solar energy production.  Apart from economic collaborations, Abu Dhabi also aims for political recognition in the alternative energy sector. It aspires to make Masdar City the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IREA), potentially relocating IREA from Bonn, Germany.  The article emphasizes that renewable energy has become a global business with significant growth potential. Countries such as the United States and European Union have set ambitious targets and plans to increase their share of renewable energy production. Additionally, wind power capacity has seen substantial growth globally and shows potential for further expansion.  In summary, this news article highlights Abu Dhabi's commitment to promoting renewable energy through investment and alliances at both national and international levels. Masdar City serves as a focal point for these efforts and aims to position itself as a leading hub for clean technology advancements while attracting significant interest from companies, governments, and financial institutions worldwide.",explain
"This news article discusses several key developments in China's political and economic landscape. The main focus is on the expansion of the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee from seven to nine members. The article suggests that this new leadership team will need to practice consensus building amongst themselves.  Julien Lippmann, an analyst from Credit Suisse Equity Research, comments on this expansion and states that it signifies a shift in power within the party. He also mentions Jiang Zemin's ""Three Representations"" theory being enshrined in party doctrine. According to this theory, besides representing peasants and the working class, the party now aims to represent ""advanced production forces"" and ""advanced culture"", as well as the majority of the population.  The article emphasizes that these changes are aimed at strengthening the Communist Party's power base among different segments of society. It highlights how even managers at state-owned enterprises now have a chance to join the party and have a say in party politics.  However, while improvements are being made economically, there is still work to be done in terms of civil rights. The Chinese government has revised patent, copyright, and trademark laws but needs further progress regarding civil liberties. Julien Lippmann notes that Chinese citizens can now acquire land rights instead of only being able to buy property or rent land for limited periods.  The economic situation is said to have improved significantly as well. China has joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and both NPC and its standing committee have revised relevant laws concerning intellectual property rights. Julien Lippmann mentions these improvements play a significant role in protecting private property under law.  Despite these economic reforms shifting China towards a market economy model, political reforms have not been implemented at an equal pace. The current priority for the government is ensuring social stability while grappling with unemployment issues caused by heavily indebted state-owned enterprises.  Another notable development mentioned in the article is China opening up its A-share market for selected institutions to invest in yuan. Previously, only Chinese investors were able to invest in A-shares, while foreign investors could only access less liquid B-shares or options listed on the Hong Kong exchange. The opening up of this market is an attempt by authorities to attract more foreign direct investment and stimulate local stock markets.  Credit Suisse analysts do not expect an immediate rush of foreign interest due to potential repatriation difficulties and high valuations for A-shares. They suggest focusing on more favorably priced H-shares and red chips, which are stocks traded on the Hong Kong exchange.  In conclusion, China's political landscape is evolving with the expansion of its leadership team and a shift in party doctrine. Economic reforms have improved the country's standing globally, but there are still challenges regarding civil rights and unemployment. The opening up of China's A-share market may attract more foreign investment but is expected to be a gradual process. Political reforms remain uncertain, with further details needed before Credit Suisse adjusts their marketing rating for China.",explain
"This news article is an interview with someone who has experienced doing business in Bulgaria. They discuss their experiences with the business environment, highlighting some of the challenges and opportunities they have encountered.  The interviewee starts by talking about their initial partners, mentioning that they were almost forced out of the business without any compensation. They also mention that institutional sloppiness and arbitrariness nearly drove them to bankruptcy. This suggests that there have been issues with how business operations are conducted in Bulgaria.  Despite these challenges, the interviewee mentions that things have recently changed for the better due to ongoing reform processes. There is a general consensus among the people about the need for reforms in administration and justice systems. While organized crime and corruption still exist as problems, they are said to be in retreat.  The interviewee highlights some positive developments as well. For instance, they mention increasing production from 2,000 bikes annually to 300,000 bikes. Additionally, they state being involved in real estate ventures at present.  When asked about comparing Bulgaria's regulatory situation with Switzerland's (where they presumably conducted business before), the interviewee expresses being offput by Switzerland's regulations and wages paid to employees. They find it easier to solve problems faced in Bulgaria despite their different nature.  The importance of ensuring consistently high quality is emphasized by acknowledging daily battles in maintaining quality awareness and dependable employees—a trait not considered as good as Switzerland's standard according to them.  Bulgaria is described as less highly regulated than Switzerland but extremely bureaucratic nonetheless—requiring many documents certified by a notary. Although things take longer to happen compared to Switzerland, it is stated that many possibilities exist within Bulgaria despite its time-consuming nature.  While reflecting positively on their experiences overall—acknowledging success both in bicycle manufacturing and real estate dealings—the interviewee also mentions how draining these seven years have been due to unforeseen challenges cropping up regularly.  They believe it will take two or three generations for Bulgaria to completely shed its communist past and associated idiosyncrasies. It is emphasized that Bulgarians need to adopt a mindset of lasting development, understanding the importance of reliability, and being conscious of quality. The focus should be on persistent reform processes, not just short-term success.  Despite the challenges, the interviewee expresses confidence in Bulgaria's potential for success. They mention expanding into the real estate sector continuously and even considering moving into other countries like Georgia or Ukraine.  In summary, this news article presents an interview with an individual who has been conducting business in Bulgaria. They discuss both the challenges and opportunities they have encountered while highlighting changes taking place due to ongoing reform processes. The interviewee reflects on their experiences in comparison to another country and emphasizes the importance of long-lasting development and reform mentality among Bulgarians for future success. The interviewee continues by emphasizing that doing business in Bulgaria comes at a high price in terms of the daily struggles faced. They mention that despite this, they are continuously expanding their ventures in the real estate sector, indicating that there are still opportunities for growth and profitability.  Furthermore, they reveal an interest in exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries like Georgia or Ukraine. This suggests their willingness to explore new markets and take advantage of potential benefits outside of Bulgaria.  When asked about their overall perspective on Bulgaria's future, the interviewee remains optimistic. They believe that it will take time—possibly two or three generations—for Bulgaria to fully overcome its communist past with its inherent idiosyncrasies. They emphasize the need for Bulgarians to embrace lasting development rather than pursuing short-term, overnight success.   The interviewee notes the importance of reform processes not only within administrative systems but also within people's minds. They emphasize qualities such as reliability and consciousness of quality as crucial factors for sustainable growth.  Despite acknowledging some downsides and challenges faced during their business ventures in Bulgaria, such as institutional sloppiness and corruption issues, they express confidence in both the country's potential and its people's ability to succeed moving forward.

"This news article discusses the current situation of emerging markets and their resilience in the face of the global economic crisis. It highlights different regions and their specific challenges and opportunities.  The article begins by stating that many emerging markets are flirting with recession. Kasper Bartholdy, Credit Suisse's chief economist for emerging markets, emphasizes this point during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He states that 2009 will be a very tough year for emerging markets.  Latin America is mentioned as one region heavily affected by declining commodity prices. This decline has had a significant impact on the economies of countries in this region. On the other hand, emerging countries in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) have suffered from a drop-off in international funding flows. Additionally, oil-producing nations in EMEA have been hit hard by plummeting oil prices. Africa as a whole has also felt the impact of falling commodity prices.  Asia is described as not being as dependent on international capital compared to other regions. Most Asian countries are commodity importers and therefore benefit from lower commodity prices. However, it is noted that Asia still suffers from decreased demand for its industrial and manufacturing products due to reduced global economic activity.  Despite these challenges, Bartholdy points out some positive aspects regarding emerging markets' ability to withstand the crisis. Many emerged into this situation with strong growth rates and fiscal balances while implementing prudent macroeconomic policies that enable them to access funding relatively easily from institutions such as International Monetary Fund (IMF). The stability of their currencies after initial depreciation against major currencies has allowed central banks in various emerging economies to cut interest rates to mitigate some pain caused by downturns.  Bartholdy mentions signs indicating that global economy may be reaching its bottom point such as stabilization of commodity prices over two months period or improvement in indicators like German consumer confidence index or Chinese purchasing managers index (PMI).  The article also includes insights from Najib Mikati, former Prime Minister of Lebanon, who emphasizes the positive growth expected in Lebanon for this year. He attributes this to the good collaboration between the central bank and the financial sector as well as trust-built cooperation. The stability of Lebanese central bank's foreign currency reserves has helped it maintain a secure financial sector.  Pavel Teplukhin, a pioneer in mutual investment funds and private banking industry in Russia, shares his perspective on how Russia's perceived safety as a haven was proven wrong due to its exposure to the US crisis. He mentions that Russian assets are currently undervalued, but proper revenue forecasts are difficult to estimate. Teplukhin also highlights China and Russia having potential foreign exchange reserves that amount to 30-40% of their GDPs, allowing them some capacity to run budget deficits if required. However, he cautions against risking recovery through this means and suggests controlling government expenses, keeping budgets under control with low interest rates while supporting local investment demand.  In conclusion, this news article sheds light on emerging markets' struggles amidst the global economic crisis while also highlighting their resilience due to strong economic fundamentals and prudent policies implemented prior to the crisis. It underscores specific challenges faced by different regions such as commodity price declines or reduced international funding flows but also identifies potential opportunities such as lower commodity prices for countries reliant on imports.",explain
"This news article discusses the contrasting situation in India, particularly in terms of the wealth disparity between the rich and poor. According to a survey by Forbes magazine, the number of billionaires in India has increased from 24 to 50 within a year. The top five richest people globally include two Indians, Mukesh Ambani and Lakshmi Mittal.  However, despite this increase in wealth for some individuals, the World Bank estimates that over 40 percent of India's population is living below the poverty line. This means that they have an income of less than $1.25 per capita per day. Extensive poverty among rural populations has led thousands of people to migrate from rural areas to cities like Mumbai and New Delhi.  There is no up-to-date data on the exact number of people living in these cities due to continuous migration inflows and limited official census information since 2001. As a result, these cities are facing overcrowding issues with millions of inhabitants residing there.  The scarcity of infrastructure resources has become a significant problem due to this influx into major cities. Credit Suisse's seventh field trip had discussions about this issue with various government agencies estimating that around $500 billion investments will be required over the next few years for transportation, energy, gas, water supply projects, and more.  An expert highlighted during discussions that global growth has shifted towards China and India as economic centers. However, challenges related to infrastructure development often arise due to political or bureaucratic obstacles.  The need for employment opportunities leads road-building projects relying heavily on manual labor provided by women as well as men since it employs a substantial part of India's population.  One site visited during this trip was Moser Baer in Noida city near New Delhi which manufactures optical storage media such as CDs and DVDs along with photovoltaic solar cells since 2005. It also ventured into home entertainment products like headphones or DVD players under its own brand name aside from its optical computer mice division.  The group also visited Gurgaon, which is an industrial area near Delhi. This location is significant as it was where India's first modern passenger car, the Maruti 800, was produced in partnership with Suzuki. Today, Maruti is majority-owned by Suzuki and accounts for the largest share of cars manufactured in India. The company believes that India will become even more crucial for their production with plans for their first R&D operation outside Japan.  Overall, this article highlights the conflicting situation in India regarding wealth distribution, with a growing number of billionaires alongside a significant portion of the population living in poverty. It also touches on the challenges faced by major cities due to rapid urbanization and insufficient infrastructure resources. The article also sheds light on the reasons behind India's attractiveness as a manufacturing destination compared to China. Representatives from Moser Baer and Maruti Suzuki, both major players in their respective industries, highlighted several advantages of doing business in India.  These advantages include a developing market and business environment, government support, higher education standards, and the widespread proficiency of the English language among the educated population. The ability to communicate effectively in English is seen as a significant advantage for international companies operating in India.  The article then shifts focus to a visit to Maruti Suzuki's production plant in Gurgaon. The plant is known for its efficient manufacturing line and high productivity rates. Maruti Suzuki holds the lion's share of the domestic car market in India and also exports a substantial number of vehicles internationally.  During discussions with Maruti Suzuki's CFO Ajay Seth, it becomes evident that India plays an increasingly critical role as a production base for parent company Suzuki. The establishment of research and development (R&D) operations outside of Japan demonstrates their commitment to tapping into India's booming domestic market quickly.  The author concludes with an observation on how these visits highlight both the challenges faced by infrastructure development in India due to political obstacles and bureaucratic hurdles, as well as the potential opportunities for economic growth through investments in various sectors such as transportation, energy supply, water supply, etc.  Overall, this news article provides insights into two contrasting aspects of India: its growing number of billionaires alongside widespread poverty among its population. It delves into important issues like urbanization challenges faced by major cities due to migration from rural areas and infrastructure deficiencies. Additionally highlighted are opportunities for investment-driven growth amid global recognition that China and India have become prominent centers of economic activity.",explain
"This news article discusses the growing consumer market in China and its impact on various industries. It starts with the prediction that China will soon overtake Japan as the second largest consumer market. Currently, China has a trade surplus of about 7 percent of its GDP, which amounts to roughly $150 billion. While China imports around $800 billion worth of goods, a significant portion is used as inputs for manufactured goods industries that are then re-exported.  The imports into China are mainly focused on oil, mineral ores, components, intermediate goods, and construction equipment. However, there is a small percentage of direct consumer product imports because many multinational companies manufacture their products in China to sell domestically. Luxury products are also imported into the country.  The article highlights some successful luxury brands like LVMH Group (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) and anticipates their continued success in the Chinese market. High-end automobiles such as BMW are also performing well according to a survey mentioned in the article.  Two important aspects that deserve attention are travel and the property market. The survey data reveals an interesting trend in travel behavior among Chinese consumers. While most people used to work six days a week with very limited vacation time, there has been a shift towards more holiday weeks and increased spend on vacations – almost equivalent to one month's disposable income for some individuals. Domestic travel within China is prevalent due to factors like improved accessibility through internet-based ticket agencies and successful domestic airlines.  As for international vacations, Europe and Southeast Asia attract significant interest from Chinese tourists due to visa policies facilitating individual travel or group visas for Europe destinations. France has specifically advertised its attractions within China while America ranks lower as an appealing destination for Chinese travelers.  In terms of automobile sales, the Chinese auto market continues steady growth but faces challenges related to pricing power and weak brand perception. Respondents from the survey indicate Volkswagen and General Motors have not performed well against competitors in this particular market.  The housing sector is a crucial topic, with around 60 percent of respondents already owning their own property – a result of mass privatization in the late 90s. Additionally, 18 percent of respondents plan to buy properties within the next year, either to upgrade or for first-time purchases. The article emphasizes that property plays a significant role in Chinese consumer wealth and mentions that majority of homeowners are not heavily indebted due to historical factors in property ownership and land distribution by the state.  The article concludes by discussing cultural influences from China on various domains beyond just the economy. These influences can be seen in Hollywood movies featuring Asian settings or an increase in fashion trends utilizing silk. As China's brand power grows, it is expected that Chinese branded goods will achieve success in Western consumer markets as well.  Overall, this news article highlights key insights into China's growing consumer market and its influence on different industries such as luxury goods, automobiles, travel/tourism, and housing.",explain
"This news article discusses the importance of infrastructure, processes, innovations, and human capital in the Swiss economy. It specifically focuses on the significance of two big banks for the Swiss economy.  According to the article, these two big banks contribute around 40% of the overall value generated by banks in Switzerland. They also pay approximately 40% of the tax contributions made by banks and employ over 40% of personnel in the Swiss banking sector. Additionally, they account for 40% of domestic banking transactions.  The Swiss banking sector is characterized by a dual structure consisting of institutions with a national focus and internationally oriented banks. The former primarily operate in deposits and loans business while the latter are mainly involved in global asset management and investment banking.  The big banks play an important role as global full-service banks that engage in both domestic and foreign transactions. However, their market share is larger for transactions involving foreign clients (82%) compared to domestic transactions (41%). These big banks are significant market participants when it comes to investing savings and pension capital within Switzerland.  As per data from 2007 mentioned in this article, these two institutions managed assets worth CHF 348 billion entrusted by domestic creditors. This accounts for a substantial share—45.3%—of the overall market and around 59.7% of fixed-term deposits.  Furthermore, these big banks hold an estimated CHF 220-250 billion worth securities safekeeping accounts related to occupational benefits, fixed pension plans, vested benefits accounts/assets for insured individuals, and fixed pension plan accounts/investments at year-end 2007.  By financing approximately 36% of loans to private households and around 42% corporate loans, these big banks are major providers within Switzerland's credit market. In terms of lending specifically to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), which form cornerstones of Switzerland's economy; their market share stands at over roughly30%.  It is worth mentioning that unsecured loans are also awarded in Switzerland where no collateral is provided by the debtor. Approximately 25% of all loans granted in Switzerland fall within this category, with over half of them being awarded by the big banks.  Regarding real estate, these banks have a market share of 35% on the Swiss mortgage market, holding mortgage volumes worth CHF 236 billion. They also hold direct and indirect investments in Swiss properties through their respective pension funds.  Additionally, big banks are essential for providing trade finance services such as financing, risk minimization, and support for import-export activities to SMEs that rely on global commerce due to limited domestic markets.  Credit Suisse is specifically highlighted as the market leader in export financing within Switzerland and one of the largest providers internationally.  Asset management is regarded as a core competency and central pillar of Switzerland's banking sector stability. According to data from August 2008 issued by The Swiss National Bank (SNB), securities portfolios held in client safekeeping accounts at Swiss banks amounted to around CHF 4.8 billion. The big banks have the largest proportion of managed safekeeping account holdings based on commission revenues at year-end 2007.  Investment banking activities encompass both classic investment banking services (such as corporate financing and capital market emissions) as well as trading transactions involving securities, foreign exchange trading, commodities and banknote trading, and issuing/secondary market trading of structured products.  Companies active on the capital market rely heavily on investment banking services for obtaining investment resources, financing international activities and stock market flotation. The two big banks dominate this sector due to their specialist expertise, size advantages leading to economies of scale effect.It is noted that they hold significant shares - typically ranging from about 35% to up to around49%- across categories such as stock market flotation,bonds issued by Swiss borrowers , mergersand acquisitionsHandler:and foreign exchange/trading  The economic importance attached to these big banks is evaluated based on value creation, employment generation, tax receipts, and their influence on the Swiss balance of payments. In 2006, the banking sector in Switzerland generated substantial value.

"This news article discusses the current environment for stocks and predicts that European and Japanese equities will outperform British and American stocks in the next three to six months. The main reason for this prediction is the differences in monetary policy between these regions.  The article highlights that the Bank of England is expected to start draining liquidity soon, while it remains uncertain when the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. On the other hand, both Europe and Japan have implemented measures to stimulate their economies. In early June, the European Central Bank introduced negative deposit rates and a targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO), which could inject as much as 1 trillion euros into European banks over the next two years. Additionally, there are expectations that the Bank of Japan will also undertake further stimulus later this year.  According to O'Sullivan, an expert cited in the article, these measures should have a different impact on Europe compared to the United States due to differences in economic structure. While America is more market-driven, Europe relies more heavily on banks. Therefore, injecting more liquidity into Europe's banking system should provide a relatively larger benefit and help prevent deflationary shocks.  The article also mentions positive indicators for both Europe and Japan's economies. In June, European manufacturing expanded for its twelfth consecutive month while services businesses reported growth for an eleventh straight month. If consumer goods and industrial equipment demand continues rising, fresh loans may be sought by businesses looking to expand their operations.  In Japan, there has been an increase in inflation after several years of deflationary pressure. The consumer price index rose by 3.4% and 3.7% year-over-year in April and May respectively –the highest rates in 32 years-. Economists believe this rise is not solely due to retailers increasing prices ahead of a value-added tax hike but rather represents genuine inflationary pressures.  Credit Suisse analysts believe that equities from peripheral countries within Europe have performed well, but some markets, like Italy, may have overheated. They suggest that German stocks, benefiting from a strong economy and expected accelerating growth in the next six months, may present better prospects. Within Japan's equity market, companies included in the TOPIX index have announced substantial stock buybacks this year due to low valuations, low interest rates, and significant cash reserves. O'Sullivan identifies industrials and machinery manufacturers as potentially attractive sectors due to their potential cyclical upturn.  The article concludes by stating that investors in British and American equities have benefitted from central bank policies supporting economic recoveries over recent years. However it suggests that now the focus should shift towards opportunities in European and Japanese equities due to differences in monetary policy.  In summary:  - The article predicts European and Japanese equities will outperform British and American stocks over the next three to six months. - Differences in monetary policy are a major factor behind this prediction. - The European Central Bank's introduction of negative deposit rates along with a targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) is expected to benefit Europe more significantly compared to the US. - Positive indicators such as manufacturing expansion in Europe and increased inflationary pressures in Japan contribute to these predictions. - Specific sectors within these regions such as industrials and machinery manufacturers are highlighted as promising investment opportunities.",explain
"This news article highlights the success of tennis player Roger Federer in the Cincinnati Masters tournament. The article begins by mentioning that Federer has only won this particular tournament twice before, in 2007 and 2010, and both times he had responded to a defeat in the previous tournament with a victory in Cincinnati.  The article goes on to mention that Federer had played a total of ten matches in just 13 days, and also had to change locations during this time. It also highlights an important final match against David Ferrer, who has previously beaten Federer. Had Federer lost this match, it would have been his sixth final defeat of the season and fourth in the Masters series. This would have been damaging to his confidence.  However, Federer managed to win the final match against Ferrer. Although Ferrer performed exceptionally well during parts of their encounter, winning the second set with relative ease, Federer's response was impressive. He dominated the final set from start to finish and ultimately won the match.  The article continues by stating that this victory is significant for Federer as it is his most prestigious title in two years since winning Cincinnati in 2012. It is also his third title of the season after victories at Dubai and Halle. The win marks his 22nd title in t the Masters series and his 80th overall. Only Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl have achieved more success with 109 and 94 titles respectively.  Federer expressed his joy and satisfaction with the tournament, stating that he got stronger with each round, ultimately bringing out his best tennis during the final set. He emphasized that winning championships in this manner was exactly what he aimed for, making it even more special to be his 80th title. Federer acknowledged that at the beginning of the week, he briefly considered dropping out of Cincinnati due to fatigue from a previous event in Toronto where most matches were played late into the evening. However, he was glad that he decided against it as it led him to this well-deserved victory.  Looking ahead, Federer expressed anticipation for the upcoming US Open while also recognizing the importance of taking a momentary break after an intense period of matches. The article notes that although Federer had won numerous matches during this year's season and became the player with the most match wins so far, he had faced challenges at major tournaments losing to Stan Wawrinka, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic on several occasions.  The article provides updates on these other players as well. Nadal had suffered an injury to his right wrist which caused him to withdraw from several tournaments including New York where he emerged victorious last year. Meanwhile, Djokovic's performance since Wimbledon has been somewhat lackluster having won only two matches in two tournaments since getting married. Wawrinka has also struggled to make significant progress recently.  Nevertheless, Federer's successful run at Cincinnati has renewed hope among both himself and his fans worldwide regarding his ability to finish this year with another grand slam title - which would be his eighteenth one. The article acknowledges Federer's achievements over time as he remains optimistic about competing at Flushing Meadows despite tough competition from Djokovic and Wawrinka. Additionally, the young players Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Kei Nishikori are seen as potential contenders to break into the ranks of grand slam winners.  The article concludes by mentioning Federer's previous triumphs at Flushing Meadows where he was the first professional player to win the US Open five consecutive times from 2004 to 2008. It implies that although his success there has diminished in recent years, this victory in Cincinnati has provided Federer with renewed confidence and inspiration for the upcoming tournament.  Overall, this news article highlights Roger Federer's impressive performance at the Cincinnati Masters tournament, his resilience in overcoming challenges, and his aspirations for further success in future tournaments.",explain
"This news article discusses the result of slower employment growth in Switzerland and the potential impact it will have on the economy. Despite this slowdown, one factor that remains constant is that interest rates will remain at zero for the next year. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to take a more expansionary approach to combat deflation risks, and as a result, Credit Suisse economists believe that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will also maintain its zero interest rate policy to preserve the minimum exchange rate between the euro and Swiss franc.  The article points out that Switzerland has experienced low inflation rates and business cycle risks, which give no reason for SNB to change its monetary policy. This has resulted in consumer growth losing momentum compared to previous years when it was above 2 percent. Credit Suisse economists are predicting lower growth rates of 1.2 percent for this year and 1.0 percent for next year.  Several factors have contributed to this slowdown in consumer growth, such as saturation in the market for consumer durables and declining numbers of new consumers due to slower immigration. Additionally, price discounts driven by exchange rate appreciation are no longer happening, and distortions caused by hospital financing restructuring are disappearing.  The article also mentions lower levels of capital spending predicted for 2014 and 2015 due to subdued demand for exports. The trend is expected to continue with capital spending on machinery and equipment forecasted at 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent respectively in those years.  The approval of an initiative against mass immigration has had a small effect on lowering investment propensity as well. However, most companies surveyed have not made any changes to their capital spending plans outside Switzerland despite some intending to increase spending abroad due to changes in operating environments.  Given slow recovery in the eurozone and depressed investment climate globally, it is unlikely that Swiss export sector recovery will be sufficient enough to make up for lost momentum domestically. Credit Suisse economists predict export growth of 5.0 percent in the coming year, after 3.0 percent in 2014, but it may not be enough to compensate for other economic factors.  The article also touches upon the importance of Switzerland's relationship with the European Union (EU) and how Swiss exporters have benefited more from bilateral agreements than the EU has. It also mentions the impact of a slowing super-cycle in China and other emerging economies on global demographic trends, highlighting that countries like China and Germany face declining populations which could affect long-term economic growth.  In Switzerland, there is concern that without immigration and increased labor force participation from women and older employees, economic growth will decline significantly. The article suggests that unless these changes occur, there could be economic stagnation in Switzerland within a little over 10 years.  The news article concludes by mentioning other topics covered in 'Monitor Switzerland' such as fiscal importance of expenditure-based taxation between cantons, forecasts for the real estate market, and a commentary on an extended Free Trade Agreement with the EU.  Overall, this news article highlights various factors contributing to slower employment growth in Switzerland and discusses their potential impacts on different sectors of the economy.",explain
"This news article discusses the forecast for the US currency in 2014. According to analysts, the US dollar's rally against other G10 currencies had stalled in early October. However, despite a slight weakening in December, the dollar has been trending higher since mid-October.  The Bank of England's effective exchange rate data shows that as of January 7th, the dollar is approximately 7 percent stronger than it was at the beginning of 2013. Credit Suisse expects the trade-weighted dollar index to continue rising over the next three months and throughout the year.  The analysts believe that a likely divergence in monetary policymaking among major central banks in 2014 will give further traction to this dollar rally. They provide three examples to support this claim:  1. The Federal Reserve (Fed) announced in December that it would begin reducing quantitative easing measures. This move towards normalization indicates a tightening policy by gradually reducing asset purchases.  2. The Bank of Japan is expected to step up its own asset-buying program early this year due to worries about low inflation levels.  3. The European Central Bank (ECB) is unlikely to raise rates and may even ease further due to concerns about low inflation levels as well.  These divergent policies among central banks suggest that there will be increased strength in the US dollar compared to other currencies.  In addition, Australia's mining investment boom is expected to come to an end soon, causing a major rebalancing of its economy. If Australia's currency value does not fall naturally, it puts pressure on their central bank (Reserve Bank of Australia) to push it down through interest rate cuts once again.  As a result of these factors, Credit Suisse analysts predict that both the yen and Australian dollar will decline substantially against the US dollar. They also anticipate a decrease in euro value later on.  Specifically, they expect USD/JPY exchange rate rise from its current level around 105 yen to about 120 yen for every dollar by the end of this year. They also project a decrease in the value of an Australian dollar against the US dollar, from around 0.89 to 0.80, and a decline in the euro from around 1.36 USD/EUR to around 1.24 USD/EUR by December.  The analysts do not expect these currency movements to be short-lived but rather see them as part of a period where the US dollar outperforms other currencies that historically can last from six to nine years.  They highlight past instances when interest rates rose and how it took some time for the dollar's response to become evident. In most cases, including those between March 1972 and June 2004, the US dollar actually lost value in the first year before strengthening over time.  Investors typically turn to government bonds as a way to profit from changes in exchange rates, with US Treasury bonds being prominent choices for trading dollars. However, since investors may already hold significant amounts of these bonds due to financing the US government's current account deficit, they may have seen their bond values erode as interest rates rise.  This likely made investors wary of buying more treasuries as they feared that new purchases would also decline in value if rates continued climbing higher.  However, now that asset purchases have been reduced by the Federal Reserve and yields are expected to stabilize at a higher level (around 3 percent on ten-year notes), there is an opportunity presented by higher yields which may shift investor mindset towards focusing on potential gains instead of recent capital losses.  In conclusion, this article discusses analysts forecasting an increase in strength for the US currency throughout 2014 due to divergent monetary policies among major central banks and other economic factors impacting different currencies like Australia's mining investment boom ending. The article notes historical patterns where it took some time for currency responses following interest rate changes before eventually strengthening. It also mentions the potential shift in investor mindset towards seeing opportunities in higher yields rather than focusing on past losses.  Overall, Credit Suisse analysts expect the US dollar to outperform other currencies for an extended period, potentially lasting anywhere from six to nine years.",explain
"This news article discusses the European Monetary Union (EMU) crisis and the policy changes that have taken place since then. It highlights that while the development of the crisis in 2011 did not exactly match what was forecasted, it was similar in nature. The crisis was triggered by Greece's worsening fiscal outlook and its inability to implement the EU/IMF consolidation and reform program.  The article explains that fears of a larger default intensified when there were indications that private sector losses with Greek debt restructuring would be significant. This led to ""contagion,"" causing a sell-off in Italian sovereign bonds and increased pressure on bank stocks and bonds, not only in Italy but also across Europe. Southern European countries experienced a ""bank-run,"" as investors withdrew their money from local banks, forcing them to sell assets including government bonds.  At a macroeconomic level, these countries faced a balance of payments crisis where both the government and financial sector were at risk of losing access to external financing. As households transferred capital abroad, this exacerbating situation further. Efforts made by political leaders to stop this spiral failed because commitments made by stronger countries to support crisis-affected nations were insufficient relative to their funding needs.  To prevent an increase in the risk of EMU breakup, decisive intervention by the European Central Bank (ECB) played a crucial role. In December, banks were offered significant loans at attractive rates for an extended period which halted bank runs, reduced pressure on selling sovereign bonds, and stopped funds from being drained out of southern European countries.  The core scenario for 2012 is seen as one of continued crisis containment. It is emphasized that stability relies on having a lender such as ECB acting as the last resort preventing capital flight from occurring once again like it did in 2011 due to high fiscal deficits and large current-account deficits.  Although various funds like the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), G-20 funds or International Monetary Fund (IMF) may become available, the article points out they may not be sufficient to reassure investors. The commitment of the ECB to act as a lender is key to maintaining stability in the short term.  In the longer term, achieving sustainable fiscal deficits and debt levels is crucial. However, this will take time, especially because the Eurozone is likely to experience a prolonged period of slow economic growth. Paradoxically, while establishing an ECB ""firewall"" reduces fears of contagion should Greece exit from EMU, it simultaneously increases the risk of such an outcome by reducing other governments' willingness to fund ""profligate"" members.  The article concludes by stating that external pressure on Greece has increased since the ECB's action and that there is now a higher probability for Greece exiting EMU. Although less likely than adherence to EMU, resorting to a local ""printing press"" has become more plausible for Greece as politicians face mounting pressure.  Overall, this news article provides an assessment of past and potential future scenarios in relation to the EMU crisis and emphasizes the importance of decisive actions by institutions like the European Central Bank in preserving stability within Europe's financial system.",explain
"This news article discusses an upcoming exhibition featuring the works of famous artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The exhibition is curated by Nina Zimmer and will be held at the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland.   The article highlights one particular painting that will be showcased at the exhibition, called ""The Gypsy Girl"" or ""Summer, 1868"". This painting depicts a young woman named Lise Tréhot, who was Renoir's longtime model and muse. It is revealed that she was pregnant during the time this painting was created, which adds an interesting aspect to her expression of weariness and melancholy. The background of the painting is roughly painted, contrasting with the realistic depiction of hands with red veins. The woman's loose hair and slipped blouse go against artistic conventions of the time, capturing a more ordinary and intimate moment.  Despite challenging societal norms in his art, Renoir eventually gained recognition and success through his participation in official art exhibitions like Salon des Beaux Arts. While many Impressionist artists rebelled against prevailing morality and bourgeois lifestyles, Renoir came from a lower middle-class background as a porcelain painter. However, he found support from his artist friends who came from wealthier backgrounds.  Renoir's style is described as Impressionistic with loose brushwork and a pale palette but also drawing inspiration from traditional forms such as portraits, still life paintings, landscapes, and references to renowned artists like Delacroix and da Vinci.  The exhibition aims to showcase outstanding paintings by Renoir from major museum collections in Europe and the US to allow both general audiences and aficionados alike to appreciate these masterpieces together. One notable artwork on display will be ""Lise Holding a Bunch of Wild Flowers,"" which hasn't been seen publicly since the 1920s.  Nina Zimmer expresses her initial worry about securing all desired paintings for the exhibition due to Renoir's popularity among collectors. However, she managed to gain access to important works, including ""Woman with Parrot, 1871"" from the Guggenheim Museum and a portrait titled ""Paul Meunier (The Child in Velvet)"" from Marc Le Cœur's family archive. She mentions that this exhibition is an opportunity to provide new insights into Renoir's work and hopes to continue this approach in future exhibitions.  The article also mentions the partnership between Credit Suisse and Kunstmuseum Basel, with Credit Suisse providing support for one special exhibition every year. The Kunstmuseum Basel is known for its extensive collection of paintings and drawings by artists from the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600.  Overall, this news article provides a brief overview of the upcoming Renoir exhibition at Kunstmuseum Basel, highlighting some key artworks to be displayed as well as emphasizing Renoir's artistic style and background. In addition to discussing the specific paintings that will be showcased at the exhibition, the article also delves into Renoir's personal and artistic journey. It mentions how, during his early years as an artist, Renoir faced hardships and relied on financial support from his friends who came from more affluent families. They often lived together and supported each other through their artistic pursuits.  As Renoir gained success as an artist, he started receiving commissions to paint portraits of prominent individuals in Parisian society and was invited to exhibit his works in the salons of wealthy art collectors. This acknowledgment by the bourgeoisie and aristocracy was significant for him, but he maintained a connection with his humble origins and lifestyle by stylizing them in his art rather than completely abandoning them.  The article highlights that while Renoir embraced the rebellious spirit of his artist friends who challenged societal norms, he also found inspiration from traditional forms of art. His Impressionistic style may have been revolutionary for its loose brushwork and pale palette, but he still paid homage to academic artists like Delacroix, Ingres, da Vinci, and Titian. This mix of rebellion against conventions while keeping ties with tradition made Renoir's work distinctive.  Nina Zimmer emphasizes her approach to curating exhibitions at Kunstmuseum Basel by selecting a specific aspect or theme related to well-known artists like Renoir to provide new insights into their work. She believes this allows audiences to see familiar artists in a fresh light.  The article briefly discusses some challenges faced during the preparation of this particular exhibition due to demand for Renoir's paintings among various collections worldwide. Despite initial rejections for certain artworks sought for display, Nina Zimmer managed to secure important pieces through collaboration and support from individuals like Marc Le Cœur, who provided access to documents relating to Renoir's early work.  Furthermore, the partnership between Credit Suisse and Kunstmuseum Basel is highlighted as they resumed their collaboration after a five-year hiatus. Credit Suisse's support enables the museum to host one special exhibition each year, showcasing renowned artists and expanding public access to art.  Overall, this news article provides insights into the upcoming Renoir exhibition at Kunstmuseum Basel and explores various aspects of Renoir's artistic career, his influences, and the challenges encountered during exhibition preparation. It aims to generate intrigue and anticipation for the showcased artworks while highlighting the curator's approach in offering fresh perspectives on well-known artists.",explain
"The news article discusses the current state of emerging markets (EM) and provides insights on whether it is a good time to invest in them. It highlights several factors that need to be considered both strategically and tactically.  Strategically, the article suggests that buying EM investments should be considered when their currency and equity markets are cheap. It also mentions that if commodities are likely to outperform the cycle, it could present a good opportunity for investment. Additionally, addressing fundamental problems such as excessive private sector leverage and abnormally low levels of unemployment is crucial for EM countries.  Tactically, the article mentions two buy signals: hedge fund exposure to EM, which dropped to a 3-year low in March; and EM funds, which have experienced high outflows close to a 12-year high. However, other tactical indicators such as earnings momentum, relative economic momentum, government yields, and price momentum are currently neutral.  The overall consensus from both strategic and tactical indicators does not favor buying into EM at the moment. The article suggests that while some individual countries may still be of interest within the broader emerging market landscape, caution should be exercised before making any investment decisions.  The characteristics of emerging markets have changed over the past decade. There have been fewer crisis situations compared to previous decades. Emerging markets have become less volatile compared to developed markets (DM) and are more tightly correlated amongst themselves as well as with DMs.  To diversify a DM equity portfolio successfully within emerging markets:  1. Buy on cheap valuations: Buying when dividend yields are high and price/earnings ratios (P/E) low tends to produce higher subsequent returns. 2. Buy on currency weakness or recent GDP weakness: This strategy has been effective historically.     The article also provides some insights into specific regions within emerging markets:  1. Latin America: The region's growth has been closer to developed markets rather than other emerging market regions like Asia or Eastern Europe. The underinvestment in infrastructure, both tangible and intangible, has contributed to this slower growth. However, there are efforts being made to address this issue through long-term strategic plans. Additionally, private consumption in countries like Mexico and Brazil have been booming due to the rise of the middle-income class.  2. China and India: These two largest markets differ significantly from each other. China records a wide range of incomes while India mostly consists of low-income consumers. It is worth noting that a significant number of households have entered the middle-income bracket in Brazil since 2010.   In summary, emerging markets have evolved over the past decade and are currently showing mixed signals for investment opportunities. While some individual countries may still offer potential interest within these markets, caution should be exercised before making any investment decisions considering both strategic and tactical indicators mentioned in the article . The article also highlights the importance of understanding the characteristics and demographics of emerging market consumers. It states that the majority of EM consumers are still very poor, but the emergence of a middle class is significant, particularly in countries like Brazil. The rise of this middle-income class has led to increased consumption in these countries.  Furthermore, the article mentions that EM consumers tend to be young, with those aged 18-29 earning more than those aged 56-65 in seven out of the nine countries polled. This younger age group is also spending their money on various goods and services.  It is important to note that despite these positive factors related to consumer demographics and growth potential, other challenges remain for emerging markets. These challenges include issues such as excess private sector leverage and low levels of unemployment.  The article emphasizes caution when considering investments in emerging markets, stating that both strategic and tactical indicators currently do not support buying into EM as a whole. However, it suggests that certain individual countries may still present opportunities within this broader landscape.  The overall tone of the article suggests that while there are some positive aspects to consider within specific regions or demographic groups in emerging markets, investors should approach with caution due to the challenging economic conditions faced by many EM nations.  It's worth mentioning that this analysis represents Credit Suisse's viewpoint at a particular point in time and does not guarantee future performance or conditions in emerging markets. Investors should conduct their own research before making any investment decisions. ",explain
"The article discusses the increasing prevalence and importance of social media in today's society. It mentions that Facebook is nearing one billion users, which would make it the second-largest country in the world if it were a country. The author believes that even if Facebook eventually loses its popularity like MySpace did, there will always be another social network to take its place.  The article emphasizes that companies need to change their attitudes towards social media and actively participate in it. They should aim to create communities of friends rather than just seeking potential clients. Companies must also be willing to open up and decide who can speak on behalf of the company. Previously, only top-level executives like CEOs had this responsibility, but now everyone in an organization can become an unofficial spokesperson through platforms like Twitter or Facebook.  One important aspect mentioned is active engagement with the audience on social media instead of just passively monitoring it. Companies should listen and respond to feedback instead of merely transforming press releases into short tweets. CEOs and managing boards are encouraged to join Twitter as it allows them to directly communicate with their audience including employees and journalists.  Criticism on social media is acknowledged as a reality that companies cannot ignore. Embracing criticism actually leads to more successful outcomes for businesses because it gives them opportunities for improvement. The example given is TripAdvisor, where people openly criticize hotels leading to better overall standards within the industry.  Journalists at The Economist have learned from their experience with social media feedback that criticism can enhance their writing by allowing them to constantly improve themselves. Corporations can benefit from this process too, by using feedback as a tool for making their businesses better.  Various successful examples are provided such as Nike effectively using social media for marketing purposes, Johnson & Johnson utilizing YouTube, blogs, and Twitter despite being heavily regulated in the pharmaceutical industry, and Zappos successfully building a billion-dollar shoe business primarily through effective customer service communication via social media.  The article suggests that soon even banking services will be provided through platforms like Twitter. It mentions how the airline KLM used Twitter during volcanic eruptions to directly contact and assist affected customers, demonstrating the potential for customer service advancements through social media.  The article concludes by highlighting the risks associated with not embracing social media. Using the World Economic Forum's Facebook page as an example, it explains how initially it was uncertain whether anyone would want to become friends with such an institution. However, the page gained over 100,000 likes and received mostly positive feedback when discussions were opened up. The importance of openness is emphasized, particularly for public-facing organizations.  Overall, the article emphasizes that social media has become an integral part of society and companies need to actively engage with it in order to build communities, respond to criticism and feedback effectively, and improve their businesses. The article also touches upon the potential downsides and risks associated with social media. It points out that while social media provides opportunities for companies to connect with their audience, it also exposes them to criticism and negative feedback. However, the article emphasizes that this risk should not deter companies from actively engaging in social media.  Through examples like the World Economic Forum's Facebook page, which experienced very few negative comments despite opening up to discussions, the article suggests that embracing social media can lead to productive and civil conversations. This highlights the importance of creating a space for open dialogue where organizations can address concerns and interact with their audience in a transparent manner.  Furthermore, the article discusses how even public-facing institutions need to adopt an open approach on social media platforms. Being open allows these organizations to effectively communicate their values and engage with various stakeholders. By remaining closed off or avoiding social media altogether, institutions run the risk of disconnecting from their audiences or missing out on important opportunities for growth.  The final point made in the article is about the potential future developments in social media. The author believes that as technology continues to advance, there will be further integration between services like Twitter and banking. This indicates that embracing new technologies is not only important for current success but also prepares organizations for upcoming advancements that can revolutionize how they operate.  In conclusion, this news article emphasizes how essential it is for companies to embrace social media as a means of building communities, engaging with audiences effectively, addressing criticism constructively, and improving overall performance. While acknowledging potential risks and challenges associated with social media usage, it strongly advocates for openness as an important element of successful engagement on these platforms. The potential benefits provided by social media far outweigh any disadvantages or uncertainties that may arise along the way.",explain
"This news article features Abdul Buhari, a 30-year-old investment banker at Credit Suisse in London. Despite having a successful career in banking, Abdul is also an accomplished discus thrower and has had an international career in the sport.  Abdul explains that discus throwing is his passion and describes the magic he feels when he throws the discus. He compares it to throwing a Frisbee but mentions that the discus weighs two kilograms, similar to a bag of potatoes. He proudly shares that his best throw was 65.44 meters, which is the fourth-best result in English track and field history.  As an athlete, Abdul emphasizes how modern discus throwers are high-caliber performers who meticulously analyze and vary their movements to achieve better throws. However, Abdul's journey to success was not without struggles. Initially starting as a teenager running the 400 meters, he later took up discus throwing after being injured multiple times.  Abdul faced challenges with his physique and self-confidence. He had to bulk up from 80 to over 100 kilograms to excel in discus throwing and also had to overcome shyness when performing in front of crowds. While he admits that emotions sometimes still get in the way even today, he appreciates the restrictive ticketing policy of the London organizers for not granting admission tickets for his relatives during Olympics events since their presence might distract him from performing well.  In 2008, Abdul experienced both progress and setbacks - missing qualifying for Beijing Olympics by only 70 centimeters (1 percent short of qualifying). Determined to prioritize his sporting career over full-time work at Credit Suisse, Abdul mustered up courage and explained this decision to his boss. Surprisingly supportive of his ambitions, Credit Suisse allowed him to work part-time (40 percent) while nurturing his athletic pursuits.  He proudly shares that many clients have become fans of his athletic endeavors and some even attend his competitions. Abdul consulted with the head of the trading floor, who advised him to treat his sporting career as his own business, taking responsibility for its success.  To further invest in his athletic performance, Abdul changed coaches and made adjustments like giving up fasting during Ramadan when it coincided with a major championship. He employs marketing tools like a personal website and Twitter account to promote himself and carefully tracks his performance data.  Abdul makes significant financial investments in his career by spending more on food and travel than on his mortgage. A large portion of this expenditure goes towards purchasing meat, demonstrating the importance of nutrition in supporting his training regimen. Each week, he travels three hours to Loughborough where he can access top-notch training facilities.  Abdul finds stability in marriage since marrying in 2010 and acknowledges that he is currently at the best age for a discus thrower at 30 years old. Ultimately, Abdul's story exemplifies dedication to pursuing one's passion alongside professional commitments while also managing personal growth and overcoming challenges along the way. Continuing from where we left off, Abdul has reached a turning point in his athletic career. Through his dedication and hard work, he has managed to balance his job at Credit Suisse with his training as a discus thrower. This shows that he is not only committed to excelling in both domains but also willing to make sacrifices for his passion.  Abdul's commitment to improving as an athlete goes beyond just physical training. He understands the importance of marketing himself and building a personal brand. By leveraging tools like his website and social media presence, he keeps track of and shares updates on his performance data with fans and supporters.  One intriguing aspect highlighted in the article is how Abdul draws inspiration from trading strategies in building up his athletic career. By treating himself as an independent small business, taking full responsibility for every aspect of his sport, Abdul applies principles from the banking industry to help him excel as an athlete.  The article also sheds light on the financial aspects of Abdul's pursuit of excellence. It is evident that being an elite athlete comes at a significant cost—Abdul spends considerable amounts on food and travel each month, investing more in these areas than even on his mortgage payments. This showcases how much he values investing in himself and dedicating resources towards achieving optimal results.  Another notable point mentioned is how supportive Abdul's workplace has been throughout this journey. Despite working within the demanding field of investment banking, Credit Suisse accommodated Abdul's part-time work schedule so that he could focus more intensely on training and competitions. Moreover, many of Abdul's clients have become fans who actively support him emotionally by attending various sporting events showcasing their interest not just professionally but also personally.  Abdul's story serves as motivation for aspiring athletes who may face obstacles or feel torn between professional careers and sporting passions. It demonstrates that with dedicated effort, strategic planning, self-belief along with the right support system – both personal (such as his wife) and professional (employers and clients) – it is possible to excel in multiple areas of life.  Lastly, the article emphasizes that Abdul's journey has not been a smooth ride. It highlights his setbacks, physical struggles, and occasional emotional hurdles. However, he persevered through these challenges, learning from them along the way. This perseverance speaks volumes about Abdul's tenacity and mental strength.  In conclusion, this news article tells the inspiring story of Abdul Buhari—a successful investment banker who is also pursuing his passion for discus throwing at an elite level. It showcases how he balances both worlds, reveals his dedication to self-improvement in all aspects of life, and emphasizes the support he receives from colleagues and clients alike. Overall, it serves as a reminder that with determination and hard work, one can achieve great success in multiple areas of their life.",explain
"This news article discusses Serbia's desire to join the European Union (EU) and the potential benefits and challenges associated with this goal.  Serbia has been a potential candidate for EU membership since 2003, and in 2009, it formally applied for membership. The idea of joining the EU has received widespread political and popular support within Serbia. A recent survey conducted by Serbia's official European Integration Office showed that 53 percent of citizens would support EU membership if a referendum were held in the near future. This percentage has decreased from around 70 percent five years ago, but still only 24 percent would vote against joining the EU.  The belief that EU membership would be beneficial is stronger among Serbian people compared to neighboring Croatia, where only 27 percent of respondents regarded EU membership as beneficial according to a recent Eurobarometer survey.  In terms of economic growth, between 2000 and 2008, Serbia experienced an average annual GDP expansion of over 5 percent driven primarily by non-tradable sectors. However, this growth model led to a wide current account deficit due to an external trade imbalance. The deficit was financed by capital inflows and foreign direct investment (FDI). When the global economic crisis hit in 2008, Serbia's growth model became unsustainable.  To address these issues, Serbia entered into a Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 2009. This arrangement aimed at transforming Serbia's economy from consumption-driven to export-led growth. So far, these reforms have had some success as GDP grew by approximately 1.8 percent in 2010 driven largely by external demand.  The IMF forecasts further GDP growth of at least 3 percent in2011 and at least5percent in2012.However,high inflationand elevated unemployment continue to impact domestic demand negatively.Additionally,the recent surgeinportfolio inflows has caused appreciation pressure onthe Serbian Dinar,which poses a threat to Serbia's competitiveness in an export-led recovery phase.  Given the structure of Serbia's economy, both the government and the business sector see EU membership as synonymous with prosperity. Serbia's future economic success is heavily reliant on export growth and facilitated access to the European market. Joining the EU also provides an opportunity for developing more mature financial markets in Serbia.  The Serbian equity market has attracted investor attention due to its strong performance, with returns exceeding 40 percent between January 2001 and June 2011. The MSCI Serbia index has outperformed most regional peers as well as the MSCI Frontier Market index, of which it is a constituent. Cross-border acquisitions may incentivize local companies to list on the local stock market, which currently experiences low liquidity and high volatility.  In conclusion, this news article highlights Serbians' generally positive attitude towards EU membership and their belief that it would bring economic benefits. However, it also underscores challenges such as managing inflation and unemployment while maintaining competitiveness within an export-led recovery phase. Joining the EU could provide Serbia with access to a larger market for its exports and facilitate investment inflows leading to sustained economic growth in the long term. Furthermore, EU integration offers a range of benefits beyond economic growth for Serbia. Access to the European market would provide Serbian businesses with opportunities to expand and access a larger customer base. This could lead to increased foreign direct investment and technology transfers, which are essential for the modernization and development of industries within Serbia.  Moreover, EU membership would bring regulatory alignment with European standards and norms in areas such as trade, agriculture, environment, and labor rights. This alignment would enhance Serbia's standing in international markets by ensuring compliance with global standards and attracting more foreign investment.  Additionally, EU integration is seen as important for political stability in the region. Joining the EU is also seen as a way to strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption, increase transparency, protect human rights and minority rights – all of which are vital factors in establishing stable governance.  However, there are challenges that need addressing before Serbia can become an EU member state. Key among these is resolving longstanding disputes with neighboring countries such as Kosovo. The normalization of relations between Belgrade (capital city of Serbia)and Pristina (capital city of Kosovo), achieved through dialogue under the auspices 0f the European Union in 2013-2015 which resulted in several agreements being reached.These agreements included areas like justice cooperation,police cooperation,and establishing an Association/Community of Serb-Majority Municipalities.*  Moreover,the issueofSerbia'sstrainedrelationshipwithRussiaalso poses a challenge to its EU aspirations.Despite Russia's strong oppositiontoSerbiajoiningtheEU,Serbia has takensteps,suchas joiningeconomic sanctionsagainst Russia because itannexed Crimea from Ukraine,and seekedto maintaina balanced relationshipbetweentheEUandRussia.

Whilst Serbia has made progress in terms of economic reforms and integration efforts, resolving issues such as disputes with neighboring countries and maintaining a balanced stance on international relations remain challenges on its path to EU membership.  *Note: The information about the agreements reached between Belgrade and Pristina was accurate as of 2015. It is important to verify the latest developments regarding these agreements.",explain
"This news article discusses the impact of buying stocks that trade less frequently, such as hourly instead of every minute. The author introduces two concepts: a liquidity premium and a popularity premium.  The liquidity premium refers to the additional return that can be created by investing in less liquid stocks, which are typically riskier. However, the author argues that this extra return might not necessarily be a risk premium because stocks that trade less often actually show lower volatility and do not seem more risky.  On the other hand, the popularity premium suggests that stocks with higher trading volumes are more popular among investors. The author points out that there is mispricing in these heavily traded stocks because they become ""too"" popular. This mispricing occurs due to their high demand and can lead to different return structures among less popular and more popular stocks.  The article draws a comparison between bond markets and equity markets. In bond markets, investors can see the yields to maturity upfront, providing clarity on future returns. In contrast, equity market returns are volatile and difficult to predict since investors only see the end result rather than forward returns.  Furthermore, there is behavioral bias in the equity market where people tend to be attracted to highly traded stocks despite having no clear indication of their future performance. This behavior parallels consumer choices based on brand popularity; individuals may be willing to pay more for popular brands without considering underlying value or quality.  Mispricings exist in both bond and equity markets but may be smaller and more visible in bonds than equities due to their mathematical nature with visible spreads. Liquidity is also an important consideration as investors require some liquid assets alongside illiquid ones like real estate or private equity investments. It is noted that illiquid assets can pose challenges during financial crises when selling becomes difficult at favorable prices.  The article mentions an interesting argument suggesting retail investors tend to follow opposite trends compared to overall stock market movements - selling after crashes and buying after rises - potentially indicating suboptimal trading behavior. Restricting overtrading by retail investors might lead to better performance. However, despite potentially making wrong decisions due to liquidity preference, people still desire liquidity.  In conclusion, the article emphasizes the impact of trading frequency on stock returns and perceived risk. Different return structures exist among less popular and more popular stocks, with mispricing occurring in heavily traded ones. It highlights the visibility of yield-to-maturity in bond markets compared to equity markets' volatile returns and discusses the challenge of balancing liquidity with illiquid investments. Overall, investor behavior is influenced by popularity and liquidity despite potential drawbacks in decision-making processes. The article further delves into the benefits of investing in stocks that trade less frequently. One significant advantage highlighted is the ease of selling these stocks in times of crisis without having to accept substantial discounts. This suggests that low-frequency trading stocks offer a level of liquidity and stability during turbulent market conditions, making them more attractive to investors seeking steady returns.  The author also touches upon the behavior of retail investors in relation to stock market trends. It is noted that retail investors tend to sell their holdings after a market crash and buy when prices have already risen. This behavior implies that emotional decision-making based on fear and herd mentality often leads retail investors to make suboptimal investment choices.  However, the article acknowledges that despite these irrational tendencies, people still have a strong preference for liquidity. The desire for liquidity stems from various reasons such as meeting immediate financial needs or having the flexibility to adjust investments according to changing circumstances. Restricting or discouraging overtrading by retail investors might theoretically lead to better performance, but it overlooks the fundamental need individuals have for liquid assets.  In addition, there is a mention of evidence suggesting that overall stock market trends tend to go against what retail investors do – essentially moving in an opposite direction. This observation further supports the notion that uninformed behavioral biases can impact investment outcomes negatively.  To conclude, the article seeks to shed light on two premiums associated with different trading frequencies: liquidity premium and popularity premium. It highlights how heavily traded stocks often experience mispricing due to their popularity among investors while less frequently traded stocks exhibit lower volatility without necessarily being riskier. The comparison between bond markets and equity markets emphasizes the importance of visibility regarding future returns in determining risk and making informed investment decisions.  Despite acknowledging potential flaws resulting from emotional decision-making processes driven by popularity and liquidity preferences, it underscores people's inherent desire for liquidity in investment portfolios while also recognizing its importance for asset diversification purposes during financial crises.  Overall, understanding various premiums, investor behavior, and the role of liquidity is crucial in comprehending market dynamics and making informed investment choices. The article provides insights into these factors, highlighting the complexities involved in trading frequencies and their impact on stock prices and market efficiency.",explain
"This news article discusses the approach and techniques used by composers in creating music that goes beyond mere calculations and aims to express complex emotions. The article focuses on two specific pieces: Sonata No 2 for Piano, Concord, Mass. by Charles Ives and Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano by John Cage.  The first piece mentioned is Sonata No 2 for Piano, Concord, Mass. composed by Charles Ives. This piece is known to be rarely performed due to its complexity and difficulty. Ives experimented with different rhythms occurring simultaneously, using various tonalities at the same time, and blending complex tonal languages with simpler ones. He drew influences from genres such as pop music of his time and Beethoven's fifth symphony, incorporating them into a single musical language.  The second work discussed is Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano by John Cage. This piece is considered a significant landmark in the repertoire of 20th-century music. Cage attempts to bring together elements from both Eastern and Western musical traditions through a unique method. He modifies the sound of the piano by placing metal objects inside its strings, producing percussive sounds reminiscent of Eastern percussion instruments. Additionally, he incorporates elements from Indian music philosophy while also utilizing Western sounds and tonality in certain parts of the composition.  Cage's work aims at translating specific emotions into music based on ancient Indian culture's nine permanent emotions such as anger, fear, love, jealousy etc. Each piece in this cycle revolves around a pivotal emotion derived from these nine emotions.  Silence plays a crucial role in Cage's ensemble as it is often employed alongside traditional musical notes or tones in his compositions—an element commonly found in many non-Western musical traditions that emphasize silence or meditation during performance.  Overall, this kind of contemporary 20th-century music is not usually part of typical repertoire performed at international series events; therefore being part of such performances affirms the artist's enthusiasm and honor for participating in the series. The article mentions the artist's excitement for bringing this repertoire to new audiences.  The Hong Kong Arts Festival is highlighted as a significant platform for showcasing global artistic talent in a vibrant city setting. Running annually from February to March, it features various performances and programs including music, theater, dance, popular entertainment, film, and exhibitions. The festival has attracted renowned artists from around the world since its inception in the early 1970s.  Since 2009, Credit Suisse has collaborated with the Hong Kong Arts Festival on their Emerging Artists Series. This series aims to provide a prestigious opportunity for rising young artists from various art forms to showcase their talent and creativity as they embark on international careers.  The 2013 series includes performances by Quatuor Ebène (string quartet), Martin Fröst (clarinetist), and Ralph van Raat (pianist).  In conclusion, this news article focuses on composers' desire to express emotions through music rather than relying solely on calculations. It highlights two specific compositions by Charles Ives an d John Cage that exemplify this approach. The article emphasizes the complexity and experimental nature of these compositions, as well as their unique incorporation of different musical elements.  The article also mentions the Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series, which is a partnership between Credit Suisse and the Hong Kong Arts Festival. This series aims to showcase talented young artists from various art forms and provide them with an opportunity to launch their international careers. The 2013 series specifically features performances by Quatuor Ebène, Martin Fröst, and Ralph van Raat.  The Hong Kong Arts Festival itself is described as a pinnacle event in Hong Kong's performing arts scene. It attracts around 200,000 visitors annually with its diverse program of music, theater, dance, popular entertainment, film screenings, and exhibitions. The festival has a rich history of hosting world-renowned musicians and performers from different genres.  The article concludes by highlighting the artist's excitement at being included in such company and performing contemporary 20th-century music within an international series. It notes that this genre is not typically included in such events but now receives recognition through platforms like the Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series.  Additionally mentioned are some upcoming performances on the artist's schedule—a tour featuring Tan Dun's ""The Banquet"" Piano Concerto conducted by Tan Dun himself; a performance of George Gershwin's Concerto in F with the Cairo Philharmonic; performances and CD recordings of Tauno Marttinen’s Piano Concerto with the Finnish Turku Symphony Orchestra; and a recital performance at the Bach Festival of Thüringen in Germany.  Overall, this news article celebrates composers who boldly experiment with new approaches to convey complex emotions through their music. It highlights specific works by Charles Ives and John Cage while also shedding light on events like the Hong Kong Arts Festival and partnerships such as Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series that aim to elevate rising talents across various artistic disciplines.",explain
"The article discusses the current state of the Irish economy, which has been struggling since the collapse of a property bubble in 2008 led to a severe banking crisis. However, there are signs this year that capital markets and investors are gaining confidence in Ireland.  One positive development is that the government successfully sold 5 billion euros worth of new benchmark bonds for the first time in three years. This indicates that investors are showing trust in Ireland's economy. In addition, the government sold the state-owned insurance company Irish Life to a Canadian firm earlier this year.  The article also highlights that unlike some other European countries, Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem. In fact, its export prices fell relative to other Eurozone countries even during the boom years of the mid-2000s. Moody's recently praised Ireland's competitive exports when it affirmed its credit rating. However, Moody’s rating was still just below investment grade with a negative outlook due to concerns about Ireland's vulnerability to wider euro-area stresses and weaknesses in its banking sector.  The banking sector remains troubled in Ireland, but Credit Suisse analysts believe markets may not get overly concerned about it just yet because of several factors. Firstly, Ireland is already under a bailout program and has seen substantial declines in deposits since the start of the financial crisis. Secondly, post-crisis Irish banks are among Europe's best capitalized. The Irish central bank is also urging private banks to extend loans for struggling homeowners by lowering monthly bills or allowing interest-only payments for a period.  One major threat to Ireland is expected economic slowdown following Cyprus' bailout situation. Despite Cyprus having only a small share of GDP within Europe, precedent set by its bailout and shock to confidence due to how it was implemented can negatively impact growth in Eurozone. But growth and stability are exactly what Ireland needs most at present; around 60% of their exports go to EU countries – hence any slowdown would be detrimental.Also noteworthy is Ireland’s large budget gap, expected to be 7.5% this year, which is one of the worst in the EU. Austerity measures will likely be necessary for at least the next three years to reduce this deficit. However, it is also crucial that the economy grows by 2% annually to ensure sustainable debt levels.  The article concludes by highlighting Ireland's vulnerability to shocks in near-term and how any negative effect on growth or delay in fiscal consolidation could seriously threaten its recovery. Therefore, while there may be more reasons for optimism compared to other periphery nations, Ireland will closely watch for signs of Cyprus contagion.  In summary, despite past economic challenges, Ireland has shown some recent positive signs such as successful bond sales and competitive exports. However, concerns remain regarding banking weaknesses and budget deficits which require a combination of fiscal consolidation measures and economic growth for long-term stability. To further expand on the article, it is important to understand the context of Ireland's economic struggles and how they have affected the country since 2008.   The collapse of the property bubble in 2008 had a devastating impact on Ireland's economy. The bursting of this bubble led to a severe banking crisis, as many financial institutions faced significant losses due to bad loans tied to the real estate sector. This crisis resulted in a contraction in credit availability and a decline in business and consumer confidence, which in turn led to high levels of unemployment and decreased economic activity.  In response to these challenges, the Irish government embarked on a path of austerity measures aimed at reducing budget deficits and stabilizing public finances. These measures included spending cuts, tax increases, and structural reforms across various sectors of the economy.  Over time, these efforts started showing some positive results. The government's ability to sell benchmark bonds for the first time in three years indicates that there is growing confidence from capital markets and investors regarding Ireland's economic prospects. This renewed interest can be seen as a positive sign that Ireland is making progress towards restoring trust in its financial system.  Another positive aspect highlighted by Credit Suisse analyst Steven Bryce is that unlike some other European countries, Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem. Despite facing economic challenges over the past decade, Irish export prices remained competitive compared to other Eurozone countries even during boom years before 2008.  While there are encouraging signs for recovery, Moody's decision to affirm Ireland’s credit rating just below investment grade with a negative outlook reflects ongoing concerns about vulnerabilities within its banking sector and exposure to wider euro-area stresses.  The country’s banking sector remains troubled despite improvements made since 2008. However, it is worth noting that post-crisis Irish banks have strengthened their capitalization levels significantly compared to counterparts elsewhere in Europe—indicating progress toward stability within this crucial industry.  Furthermore, while many Irish citizens still struggle with mortgage repayments, the central bank is actively encouraging private banks to assist struggling homeowners by offering loan extensions, reduced monthly payments, or interest-only payment options. These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures for individuals and are also indicative of a proactive approach to addressing issues within the banking sector.  Looking ahead, there are concerns about potential spillover effects from the Cyprus crisis on Ireland's economy. The recent bailout situation in Cyprus has raised questions about the wider health of European economies and has the potential to impact growth in the Eurozone. Given that Ireland heavily relies on EU countries for export demand—around 60% of their exports go to these markets—an economic slowdown would have detrimental effects.  Additionally, Ireland faces challenges regarding its large budget deficit—the fifth largest in Europe—which is expected to be 7.5% this year. To address this issue, austerity measures will likely need to be enforced over several years alongside efforts to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs.  In conclusion, while there are positive signs emerging in Ireland's economy such as successful bond sales and competitive export prices, challenges persist with regards to its banking sector weaknesses and high budget deficits. With ongoing efforts towards fiscal consolidation paired with steady economic growth targets moving forward—especially considering Europe's economic outlook—Ireland aims to solidify its recovery path without succumbing entirely  to any negative contagion effect from external shocks such as those witnessed during Cyprus' financial crisis debacle.

"This news article discusses the potential impacts of Brexit on various economies, particularly focusing on the United Kingdom and its trade partners. The article suggests that investment spending is likely to be immediately affected by Brexit, while private consumption may experience a slower and less pronounced reaction. The UK's domestic demand is expected to slow down and potentially even contract for a few quarters.  The long-term impact of Brexit on the UK will largely depend on future economic relations with the European Union (EU). The article predicts that these relations will most likely be negative, resulting in reduced trade access and labor market mobility. This will likely have a negative effect on investment, productivity, and income in the UK.  Regarding its impact on other major economies, three main channels are examined: trade, confidence, and financial contagion. The UK is one of the world's largest importers and has a significant trade deficit. As a consequence of Brexit and the weaker British pound (GBP), overall import volumes are expected to stagnate in the second half of this year and decline around 2 percent year-on-year in 2017. Export values to the UK are also expected to drop further as most exporters would have to make price concessions due to the weaker GBP.  While countries such as China and USA may experience some decline in exports to the UK, their overall vulnerability appears less significant since exports to the UK account for only 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent of their respective GDPs.  Among European trading partners, Ireland has relatively minimal export declines due to its focus on pharmaceuticals, food, and agriculture products which are considered relatively inelastic goods. Norway's mineral fuel exports are also shielded from demand fluctuations due mainly to commodity price drops during previous recessions.  Spain, Italy, France ,and other European trading partners are expected to suffer more substantial export declines ranging from 5-10 percent next year; however estimating these numbers comes with considerable uncertainty.The direct negative effects on GDP are estimated to fall within the 0.1-0.3 percentage points range for European trading partners.  The article suggests that a second potential channel of contagion is via consumer and business confidence. Uncertainty over the EU's future after Brexit is likely to increase, potentially leading to a dampening effect on investment and consumer sentiment. However, the extent of this impact remains unclear as it is uncertain how much policy uncertainty will rise outside the UK due to the Brexit vote.  A third potential channel by which Brexit could impact the European economy is via financial contagion. Concerns have arisen that financial conditions might worsen in countries such as Italy and Spain. While bond yield spreads initially widened after the Brexit vote, they have since returned to pre-Brexit levels, suggesting market confidence in the European Central Bank's ability to prevent a sovereign debt crisis.  However, refinancing conditions for many European banks have worsened significantly since the Brexit vote, resulting in drops in stock and bond prices for these banks. This has raised concerns about economic outlooks and profitability.  Overall, tighter financial conditions are predicted to result in sub-par investment and economic growth. While there may not be a renewed financial crisis in the Eurozone due to reduced leverage in banks' balance sheets, lending activity may remain constrained.  In conclusion, this news article highlights potential impacts of Brexit on various economies both directly through trade channels as well as indirectly through changes in consumer/business confidence and potential financial contagion effects . The exact magnitude of these impacts remains uncertain but it can be expected that there will be negative consequences for most economies affected by Brexit.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of the retail sector in Switzerland, focusing on sales trends and the impact of e-commerce. The article states that sales in some areas have declined, with clothing and footwear retailers being particularly affected. However, it also highlights that shopping tourism has stabilized at a high level and continues to impact the industry.  The article mentions that although cross-border brick-and-mortar shopping has slightly decreased compared to 2015, e-commerce has continued to experience strong growth momentum. It is estimated that one in every ten Swiss francs is likely spent abroad in 2016. The retail sector as a whole is expected to stabilize in 2017 after several years of weakness due to limited growth prospects from the general economy.  However, consumer sentiment is projected to recover very gradually given stagnant unemployment rates. Inflation is also expected to make a comeback in Switzerland this year, which means consumer spending power may not increase significantly despite nominal salary increases.  The article suggests that offline shopping by Swiss residents abroad will either remain stable or decrease slightly depending on whether there are further significant currency fluctuations between the Swiss franc and euro. However, real demand is expected to increase slightly primarily due to population growth.  Retail prices are anticipated to decrease again this year following previous years' trends. As a result of these challenging conditions for non-food retailers, expansion plans for 2017 are more defensive compared with previous years but food retailers have more aggressive plans.  The non-food segment is likely to face declining sales again this year but at a slower rate than observed in 2016 while food retail sales are projected to grow slightly. The rise of e-commerce plays a significant role in the challenges faced by brick-and-mortar non-food retailers.  The article highlights Credit Suisse's forecast that e-commerce will nearly double its share of retail sales over the next five years and become increasingly prominent in segments such as clothing and home electronics (27% and 38% respectively).  The study also examines the regional supply density of brick-and-mortar retailing in Switzerland. It notes that main cities and urban areas have an above-average supply density, while rural areas have a below-average density. The article points out that between 2011 and 2013, the relationship between supply (measured in full-time equivalents) and demand declined in many regions. Retail employment declined in major city centers but expanded in some outer districts, with rental costs for retail properties being a significant factor behind this trend.  A regional analysis shows that shopping tourism had a significant impact on retailers in municipalities bordering Germany and France, causing a reduction in full-time equivalents compared to 2011. The Basel region was particularly affected by the rise of shopping tourism following the appreciation of the Swiss franc.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of the current challenges faced by the retail sector in Switzerland. It highlights declining sales, particularly among clothing and footwear retailers, as well as the growing influence of e-commerce on brick-and-mortar stores. The article also mentions various factors affecting regional supply density trends and employment patterns within different areas of Switzerland's retail sector.",explain
"The news article is discussing the potential for the Philippines to receive an investment-grade credit rating in 2013. The article highlights that leaders in the Philippines as well as foreign banks are confident about this possibility. According to Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai, the Philippines had previously fallen off people's radar due to governance problems and political instability. However, Sathirathai believes that the country's assets, such as untapped mining resources and a youthful population, were overlooked.  The article mentions that foreign direct investment in the Philippines has been relatively low in recent years, averaging around $2 billion per year. With increased visibility from investors now that the country is back on their radar, there could be a significant impact on investment levels.  Several factors contribute to this positive outlook for the Philippines. The government has signed a preliminary peace agreement with Muslim rebels, potentially ending a long insurgency and improving the investment climate. The current leader, Benigno Aquino III, has pledged to crack down on corruption charges initiated during Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's presidency. These efforts aim to inspire investor confidence.  Additionally, with many English speakers and a focus on services like business process outsourcing (BPO), the Philippines has an opportunity to compete with China for manufacturing jobs amidst rising labor costs in China. Japanese companies have already been increasing their investments via organizations like the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which promotes investment in export-producing industries.  Furthermore, public-private partnerships are being pursued by the government to enhance or expand expressways, airports, and schools. Real estate developers are also targeting a growing middle class and wealthy Filipinos interested in prestige properties.  Despite these developments and opportunities for growths such as tourism—given its beautiful beaches—the article acknowledges challenges ahead for the Philippines due to its relative lag compared to neighboring countries. Issues like worn-out airports and poor telecommunications infrastructure hinder business growth according to Filipino entrepreneur J. Alfonso de Dios, who operates in both China and the Philippines.  Tourism is another area that the Philippines could improve infrastructure for, as currently less than 2 percent of GDP revenue comes from this sector compared to countries like Thailand or Malaysia where it contributes around 7 to 8 percent. The Philippine government has launched a new tourism campaign aimed at attracting visitors with the slogan ""It's More Fun in the Philippines."" The upcoming opening of a big casino complex in Manila Bay is also expected to contribute to tourism growth. However, some experts suggest diversifying with additional attractions like theme parks or targeting middle-class Asian families.  Lastly, considering the ongoing territorial dispute between China and the Philippines, there is an emphasis on attracting Chinese tourists who currently prefer destinations like Thailand and Indonesia. With substantial investments being made in gaming resorts, there is hope that Chinese tourists will visit. Experts emphasize that maintaining good relations with China will be crucial for tourism success.  In conclusion, while challenges remain such as infrastructure deficiencies and a relatively small share of revenue from tourism, many see significant potential for investment and growth in the Philippines. Various factors such as improved governance, peace agreements with rebels, opportunities in manufacturing jobs due to rising labor costs in China, public-private partnerships for development projects, focus on real estate expansion for middle-class Filipinos along with foreign investments aligning with these developments contribute to an optimistic outlook for investment-grade credit rating prospects in the country.",explain
"This news article discusses the integration of technology in the fashion industry, highlighting its potential benefits and impact on e-commerce, garment production, and consumer experience.  The article begins by introducing the concept of a smart garment that allows consumers to track its production process and verify its authenticity. It also mentions how such garments can be easily retrieved if misplaced. The compatibility between technology and fashion is then explored, discussing various advancements such as e-textiles or smart fabrics and 3D printing.  The use of computer design in clothing production is already prevalent, with 3D-printed fashion prototypes being showcased at fashion shows or online videos. E-commerce has been effective so far, particularly for items like underwear and jeans purchased for their affordability and convenience. The article suggests that the future may involve body scanning to create personalized measurements for virtual retail stores, where purchases would be sent directly to consumers' doors.  The article then highlights Fits.me as a pioneering company in biorobotics and virtual fitting rooms. It mentions their partnership with retailer Hawes & Curtis as an example of how their technology helps solve a major problem in apparel e-commerce - customers being unable to try clothes on before buying them. By using shape-shifting robotic mannequins that mimic customers' body measurements, Fits.me provides an accurate representation of how garments will fit an individual's body shape. This innovation has led to increased clothing sales at online retailers like Quelle while decreasing returns by 28 percent.  Another groundbreaking development discussed is the emergence of e-textiles or smart fabrics that embed digital components within them to provide added value to wearers. These smart textiles can communicate, transform, conduct energy, grow, among other capabilities beyond traditional fabrics' limitations. One notable application mentioned is therapeutic textiles that provide healing or protective properties when in contact with the skin. Examples include herbal extracts coating fabric surfaces which can relieve stress or rejuvenate skin ailments.  The article emphasizes how choosing underwear will change in the future once consumers become aware of the additional benefits they can provide. It suggests that garments will become intelligent and capable of monitoring wearers' health. For instance, smart fibers with embedded sensors would detect changes in physiology such as heart rate, body temperature, or biochemistry. This information can then be stored or transmitted to monitoring clinics, aiding in assessing and improving overall health or providing high-quality supervision for chronic illnesses.  Furthermore, the article states that smart clothes will be knitted directly with conductive or optical sensors into fabrics like T-shirts, shorts, and underwear. This allows for a greater range of body signal detection at higher sensitivities compared to traditional rigid sensors like clip-ons or wristbands.  The author concludes by discussing how technology is gradually reshaping fashion perception and shopping behaviors. While encouraging readers to embrace these innovations and inventions early on, it assures them that fashionable clothing will continue to be worn despite being made from different materials due to technological advancements.  In summary, this news article highlights the impact of technology on the fashion industry. It discusses concepts like tracking garment production and authenticity verification through smart garments while also addressing advancements such as e-textiles/smart fabrics and 3D printing. Additionally, it explores Fits.me's virtual fitting rooms' success in solving apparel e-commerce's key challenge—customers' inability to try clothes before purchase—as well as future possibilities including wearable health monitoring through sensor-embedded smart clothes.",explain
"This news article discusses the economic situation in Switzerland and provides forecasts for various aspects of the economy for the current year.  The article starts by mentioning that Switzerland has a low burden of debt, which allows the government to have some flexibility in managing its finances. This has been especially beneficial at the regional and municipal levels. Overall, Switzerland's economic output increased by about 1 percent last year, and it is expected that this year there may be a slightly higher pace of growth.  One area that is likely to experience significant acceleration is exports. After stagnation last year, export volume is predicted to increase by 4 percent this year. There are two main factors contributing to this growth. First, there is better demand abroad, which will stimulate export sales. Second, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is expected to continue successfully defending the lower limit set for the euro exchange rate. This combined with higher inflation abroad may result in steady real depreciation of the Swiss franc. As a result, costs will rise more gradually for Swiss-based companies compared to their foreign competitors.  Additionally, Swiss exporters are increasingly shifting their focus towards dynamically growing regions such as Asia instead of relying solely on crisis-hit Europe. However, complete decoupling from Europe is not expected due to close economic interconnections between regions.  Capital expenditure is also predicted to accelerate slightly this year due to low-interest rates and favorable investment conditions created by governmental policies aimed at stimulating growth. Despite these favorable conditions, uncertainties surrounding business operations and below-average rates of capacity utilization continue to constrain companies' capital expenditures.  In terms of construction investment, there was a drop last year but it's expected to show positive growth (2 percent) this year compared to negative growth in previous years. However temporary rather than long-term effect reversal seems likely due volatile revenue trends experienced in construction industry over recent years.  Private consumption remains an important driver of economic growth but experts predict a slight downturn in its dynamism compared to the previous year. Factors contributing to this slight weakening include a decline in immigration rates, a slight increase in unemployment, and rising inflation that may negate nominal wage gains. Additionally, it is suggested that consumers may have made some purchases ahead of time last year due to dropping prices, which could dampen demand for 2013.  The article also mentions that the government is expected to increase its consumer spending at a slower pace than in the previous year. The predicted slowdown from 2 percent growth last year to 1.5 percent this year is seen as reasonable since an expanding public sector can hinder long-term competitiveness.  Despite these various factors and predictions, it's worth noting that the era of falling prices seems to be over in Switzerland as import prices due to a strong Swiss franc have already been passed on partially to end customers through lower prices. As there has been no significant increase in the value of Swiss franc due to the euro exchange limit set by SNB, further price advantages are not expected going forward.  Overall, experts predict mild inflation conditions with an average inflation rate of 0.4 percent for 2013.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of Switzerland's economic situation and forecasts for various sectors such as exports, capital expenditure, construction investment, and private consumption for the current year. It highlights both positive growth prospects and challenges faced by different sectors of the Swiss economy.",explain
"This news article discusses the inflation pressure experienced in emerging markets like China and India. It suggests that fears of interest rate hikes can temporarily affect these markets. However, from a structural standpoint, it is believed that the emerging market story is far from over due to various advantages leading to strategic outperformance.  The article recommends buying into phases of neutral or underperformance of the emerging markets, but emphasizes a broad-based approach rather than just focusing on equities. It highlights the importance of considering emerging market debt and local currencies alongside equities. The article lists several structural advantages such as healthy debt-to-GDP ratios, visible foreign currency reserves, fewer banking problems, and visible demographic advantages that contribute to this strategic outperformance.  The writer dismisses the notion of a bubble or overheating in the emerging markets based on these underlying structural elements. They anticipate that although there may be crowded trades due to capital flows, more strategic investors entering the market would result in less rapid inflow and outflow of money. This integration into benchmarks by strategic investors leads to an expectation of lower volatility in emerging markets compared to the past.  Additionally, commodities are mentioned as being positive investments given the current stage of macroeconomic normalization. The writer makes a strong call to buy real assets like commodities with confidence that they will outperform over the next decade as we move away from deflation threats towards reflation and ultimately inflation.  In conclusion, this news article highlights how inflation pressure impacts emerging markets and discusses various factors contributing to their long-term performance. It recommends adopting a broad-based approach when investing in these markets by considering not only equities but also debt and local currencies. The writer remains optimistic about future returns in both emerging market investments and commodities due to favorable structural elements supporting these asset classes' growth potential over time.  Furthermore, the article mentions that the current economic cycle is in a phase of reflation and heading towards inflation. This has led to a positive outlook for commodities as real assets. The writer suggests taking advantage of any weakness in commodity prices to increase exposure or extend positions in industrial metals, soft commodities, energy, and precious metals.  The justification behind this recommendation lies in the belief that real assets will likely outperform other investments over the next decade. As the pendulum swings away from deflation threats and towards inflation, commodities tend to benefit from rising prices and increased demand. This positive stance on commodities aligns with the broader macroeconomic context.  It is also worth noting that strategic investors are becoming more involved in these markets, which signifies a shift towards longer-term commitments rather than short-term speculation. This trend contributes to overall stability by reducing rapid capital flows into and out of emerging markets.  In terms of portfolio allocation, the article mentions that their benchmark exposure already has an allocation of more than 10 percent to emerging markets. However, they suggest that during normal market cycles it would be reasonable to recommend an allocation as high as 20 percent.  While acknowledging potential risks associated with crowded trades due to increased investor interest in emerging markets, including various structural advantages such as favorable debt-to-GDP ratios and visible foreign currency reserves provide confidence regarding long-term performance potential.  Overall, this news article emphasizes opportunities for investment within emerging markets and commodity sectors based on optimistic expectations about future returns. It highlights structural advantages supporting growth prospects across different asset classes like equities, debt instruments denominated in local currencies, and commodities. The integration of emerging markets into benchmarks by strategic investors is seen as a contributing factor toward lower volatility going forward.  However, it's important for readers to consider multiple perspectives when interpreting financial market information since views can vary among experts depending on their individual analysis methods or risk tolerances.

"This news article discusses a company that is now a subsidiary, with its focus on the military and civilian aeronautics markets. The company has expertise in circuit boards and has already mastered various technologies related to this field.  To enter the aerospace industry, the company had to go through extensive PR work and invest significant time to pass quality audits required for aerospace companies. This step was crucial in securing its first contracts. With the success of this new strategy, the subsidiary gradually moved away from its parent company's core activities which led to an agreement for its sale in 2011.  The capital of CES (the subsidiary) was fully sold off in 2012 to three Swiss financial investors: SVC - Ltd. for Risk Capital for SMEs, Vinci Capital Switzerland SA, and Capital Transmission SA. Today, CES SA offers two major product lines. First are standard circuit boards known for their exceptional performance. The company handles everything from design to manufacturing and assembly of processor, interface, network, and graphics boards.  Secondly, CES also offers complete systems by assembling these boards together. These systems include flight computers that meet stringent security and reliability standards for flight data controls as well as mission computers connected to sensors handling specific roles like collecting photos or videos. These technologies are installed on both civil and military aircraft.  CES also produces signal-processing subsystems primarily used in equipping airports or borders with surveillance radar systems. To ensure continuous development and growth of the company, CES maintains close relationships with universities and specialty schools throughout the region from which it recruits qualified employees.  Approximately three-quarters of their nearly one hundred employees have higher technical engineering education backgrounds including many who hold doctorates. Additionally, five to six interns are taken on each year for extensive engineering and technical training.  Although maintaining their research and development team in Switzerland incurs considerable costs,  CES emphasizes certain advantages such as proximity to schools renowned quality image,  historical links with CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), and Switzerland's political neutrality and stability that make it favorable for the company to keep its headquarters in the Geneva region.

"This news article highlights the cultural differences in China and discusses the potential for learning from each other. The author mentions that while China has achieved great growth in the past decade, it is still considered a developing country. The focus of the current generation, including the author, is to bring China to a higher level and change its global image.  The author points out that their father's generation had different priorities, primarily centered around finding a better life, supporting their families, and seeking stability. However, with the changing times, there is now an emphasis on driving China's progress and maintaining a balance between domestic reform and global engagement.  The article acknowledges the challenges faced by the Chinese government due to its massive population of 1.3 billion people. Feeding such a large number of individuals and providing sufficient job opportunities presents an ongoing challenge. Nonetheless, there is optimism that China is on the right track but patience is required.  The author reflects on their own fortunate circumstances as they inherited a large business empire from their father. They attribute their success at a young age to confidence in themselves and believing in their abilities. Furthermore, they mention sacrificing personal time with friends and parties to focus on meetings with different people as an opportunity for learning.  Defining oneself proves to be another personal challenge mentioned by the author. They sometimes struggle with finding direction and deciding what choices are right for them at this stage of life. Although external influences exist – such as media pressure or others trying to sway them – they emphasize staying true to oneself.  A significant aspect discussed in this article is philanthropy in China where giving back personally rather than just writing checks becomes crucial for societal change in attitudes towards charity work. The author currently supports students through regular meetings at Zhejiang University but aims to expand support further by envisioning over 100 students benefiting from their foundation's initiatives.  The article also addresses educational differences between China and the United States based on personal experiences of being educated in the US.

The author expresses concern about China's future workforce and highlights the need for an effective education system that fosters talent and individuality.  The article concludes by discussing personal aspirations beyond business success. The author shares a childhood dream of becoming an artist, expressing a desire to reconnect with art once their company becomes more self-sustaining. They look forward to having more time to focus on personal interests, travel, meet new people, paint, and potentially learn a third language.  In terms of personal growth, the author emphasizes being brave and willing to take risks in order to experience growth and not being deterred by failure but rather learning from it. Additionally, they admit struggles faced in finding a balance between assertiveness and sensitivity towards others both within their work environment and family dynamics.  As an only child, the pressure from family expectations adds another layer of stress for the author but acknowledges it as something they need to work on personally.

"This news article discusses the key strategies and challenges faced by fashion companies in today's competitive market. It highlights the success of Zara, a Spanish fashion company that has revolutionized the supply chain model by closely following high-end fashion shows to stay ahead of trends and quickly deliver products to their stores. This approach enables them to avoid selling at discounted prices and reduce fashion mistakes.  Zara owns its supply chain and stores, allowing them to have direct control over production and sales. Their designers actively keep an eye on street styles and internet blogs to continuously update their collections throughout the season. This fast-paced model has inspired other apparel manufacturers like H&M, who initially focused more on pricing than fashion but have since adapted their supply chains for faster production and delivery.  Another example mentioned is Uniqlo, a Japanese retailer that focuses on inventory control, positioning products strategically in specific locations at the right time. While they manufacture clothing in Japan, they also outsource some work to China.  The article emphasizes how globalization has transformed fashion companies into global entities. For example, H&M started in Sweden but successfully expanded into Europe (both Northern and Southern), China, and the USA. Similarly, Zara was originally successful in Southern Europe and Latin America before expanding into Asia, emerging markets,and ultimately entering the US market.  The article also provides cautionary tales of overexposure leading to brand fatigue. Abercrombie & Fitch became immensely popular among teenagers but lost appeal when its logo became too widespread. Similarly, Michael Kors experienced rapid growth as a brand but struggled when it expanded aggressively and suffered from overexposure.  To achieve long-term success in the industry, brands need longevity and resilience. The article cites Hermes as an example of a conservatively managed brand with enduring popularity for its Birkin bag since its creation in 1984. Another success story is Burberry which successfully repositioned itself under new designer Christopher Bailey by adding higher-margin accessories, fragrances, and babywear to its product lineup.  In conclusion, the article advises that fashion companies can be worth investing in when riding a successful trend, conservatively managed, or recovering from setbacks. However, it also warns about the pitfalls of overexposure and brand fatigue. The importance of a well-managed supply chain and selling products at full prices is highlighted as key factors for profitable growth. Additionally, globalization offers significant growth opportunities for successful fashion companies.  Overall, this article provides insights into the strategies employed by successful fashion companies as well as cautionary tales from those who have faced challenges in the industry. The article further delves into the significance of a brand's longevity and resilience. It mentions Hermes as an exemplary example of a conservatively managed brand that commands one of the highest valuations in the luxury goods sector. The iconic Birkin bag, introduced in 1984, has maintained its allure and desirability among fashion enthusiasts.  Additionally, Burberry is cited as a brand that successfully rejuvenated itself. The article highlights how the Burberry check logo had become overexposed due to its widespread adoption by British football fans and cheap imitations flooding the market. However, with the appointment of Christopher Bailey as a new designer in 2001, Burberry repositioned itself as a fashionable luxury brand. By adding higher-margin accessories, fragrances, and babywear to their product offerings, they managed to transform their worth from £200 million in 1997 to £6 billion.  The article also acknowledges that not every fashion brand can effectively expand into new product categories like Burberry did. It underscores the importance of carefully considering each company's unique strengths and capabilities when assessing investment opportunities within the industry.  In summary, this news article provides insights on successful strategies employed by fashion companies such as Zara's supply chain management and quick response to trends. It discusses how brands like H&M adapted their production processes for faster delivery but remained price-focused rather than purely driven by fashion trends.  Furthermore, it warns about potential pitfalls associated with overexposure and brand fatigue using examples like Abercrombie & Fitch losing appeal among teenagers when their logo became too common and Michael Kors facing challenges due to aggressive expansion causing overexposure.  The article concludes by emphasizing that investing in fashion companies necessitates thorough analysis of not only current success but also factors such as longevity, resilience, supply chain efficiency,and maintaining value across different markets worldwide.

"The article discusses the current state of Australia's mining sector and the potential decline it may be facing. The mining sector contributes nearly 9% to the country's GDP, but recent data shows that overall economic growth has slowed, despite interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia.  Greg Evans, Chief Economist at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, emphasizes that it is important for the rest of the economy to become more effective in order to maintain and lock in the benefits gained from the mining boom. This suggests a shift towards other sectors becoming crucial for sustaining economic growth in Australia.  One such sector is startups, like Canva, which are aiming to become global businesses right from their inception. Canva, a design platform that allows non-designers to create various design projects, plans to launch simultaneously in Australia and the US. This reflects a growing trend among Australian startups that aspire to have a global presence.  However, funding remains a challenge for these startups as Australian venture capital activity has declined due to concerns about global economic conditions. Despite this decline, there has been an increase in venture investments received by Australian companies. Some successful startups have managed to attract significant amounts of capital from foreign venture capital firms.  While Sydney ranks highly as an active startup hub globally, it falls short when it comes to access to venture capital compared with other cities on this list. Funding often comes from entrepreneurs themselves or friends and family instead of traditional VC firms.  Niki Scevak from Blackbird Ventures acknowledges this gap in Series A funding (which typically ranges between AUD 1 million - AUD 10 million) and highlights the need for more VC firms supporting these startups with global potential. Blackbird Ventures aims at investing in five - ten Australian tech companies each year but only those with international prospects.  Canva serves as an example for other aspiring startups due to its previous success with Fusion Books and recent seed funding raised from investors like Google Maps creator Lars Rasmussen. The company has even attracted attention from prominent figures like Sir Richard Branson, emphasizing its potential for global success.  In conclusion, the article suggests that Australia needs to diversify its economy beyond the mining sector and pay attention to the potential of startups in driving economic growth. However, access to venture capital funding remains a challenge for these startups, and more support from VC firms is needed to help them succeed on a global scale. The article goes on to talk about the success of Genero.tv, a crowdsourced online video platform based in Melbourne. Genero.tv allows filmmakers to create music videos or promotional films for artists and brands. The company has partnered with major music labels such as Sony, Warner Bros., and Universal Music Group, as well as brands like Yoplait and MillerCoors. Their videos have been featured at renowned events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Cannes International Film Festival, and the British Film Institute.  The founders of Genero.tv initially self-funded their venture until January 2012 when they received external funding. Despite starting with just two co-founders, the company has managed to establish itself successfully in the competitive global market for online video production.  The article also mentions other Australian startups that have attracted significant capital from foreign venture capital firms. For example, BigCommerce is a Melbourne-based startup that creates online stores for small and medium-sized businesses. It has processed nearly AUD 1 billion in transactions and recently secured a $20 million investment from General Catalyst Partners and Floodgate.  Similarly, Atlassian is an enterprise software company headquartered in Sydney that raised an impressive $60 million Series A round in 2010 from Palo Alto-based Accel Partners. These success stories highlight the potential of Australian startups to attract external funding despite challenges faced by many entrepreneurs.  Overall, while Australia's mining sector may be peaking and experiencing slower growth rates, there is optimism surrounding its startup ecosystem. The country's major cities Sydney and Melbourne are recognized as promising tech hubs globally with high entrepreneurship activity levels.  However, there remains a significant need for increased access to venture capital funding specifically at the Series A stage. Entrepreneurs often struggle to raise meaningful investments ranging from AUD 1 million - AUD 10 million necessary to scale their businesses further.  Despite this challenge, there is enthusiasm among Australia's young graduates who are increasingly considering entrepreneurship as a viable career path. Startups like Canva are leading the way by aiming for global success right from their inception, demonstrating the potential and ambition of Australian entrepreneurs.  In conclusion, Australia's startup scene is gaining recognition and attracting investor attention globally. However, more investment activity and support from venture capital firms is needed to bridge the funding gap and enable startups to scale successfully on an international level.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of monetary policies in various economies, as well as the potential risks and outlook for global economic growth.  The Bank of England (BOE) is expected to loosen its monetary policy further by implementing rate cuts and possibly reactivating asset purchases. After maintaining interest rates for almost four years, recent developments such as the UK's Brexit referendum and an economic slowdown have increased downside risks for the country's economic outlook. However, despite these challenges, growth rates above 1 percent are still anticipated for both 2016 and 2017.  Similarly, the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to extend its asset purchase program by at least six months in September. This move may involve adjusting key program parameters to ensure flexibility. Political uncertainty looms over Italy with a constitutional referendum scheduled for October. If rejected, Prime Minister Mario Renzi has stated that he would step down and call for new elections. Current polls indicate that the EU-skeptic ""Five Star"" movement could become the largest party in parliament if this scenario unfolds.  The US Federal Reserve faces implications from weaker growth in Europe and additional easing measures implemented by other central banks. This situation will likely keep the Fed cautious about raising interest rates despite less pronounced downside risks to US growth and inflation compared to the Eurozone. Recent data from June's payroll report confirms a robust US economy; however, substantial uncertainty remains regarding when exactly a rate hike will occur. The current expectation is now December 2016.  Global business activity measured by Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) experienced subdued expansion even before Brexit was decided upon in June. A significant setback for July cannot be ruled out; thus, sluggish global economic growth is projected for H2 of 2016 with primarily downward risks observed in major economies like China where a renewed slowdown is anticipated following a recent rebound.  Concerns about a potential US recession arise due to slow overall growth worldwide. Although recent US economic data showed a decline in industrial production (a typical sign of recession), manufacturing production has not displayed the same trend, and retail sales and employment continue to rise. This suggests the US economy is still distant from entering a recession.  Different models assess the likelihood of a US recession in the coming quarters. A model developed by Glenn D. Rudebusch from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that there is little evidence supporting the notion that recoveries necessarily collapse due to their age alone. The model calculates approximately 2.6 percent probability for an ending expansion next month which accumulates to slightly more than 25 percent over one year's time.  Another model by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, utilizing the yield curve as an indicator, currently shows around an 8 percent risk of recession within one year. While this is considerably higher compared to last year's prediction at 2.2 percent, it was already indicating a higher probability before the Great Recession began in December 2007.  It is crucial to consider that low longer-term interest rates stimulate economic growth by providing leverage for continued expansion while stabilized energy prices alleviate negative impacts on US manufacturing activity stemming from fluctuations in oil prices.  In conclusion, this news article emphasizes central banks' monetary policy decisions- specifically those regarding rate cuts and asset purchases- as well as potential risks for global economic growth across advanced economies like Europe and China. It also surfaces concerns about a possible US recession but highlights positive factors such as low longer-term interest rates stimulating growth and other robust components of domestic demand like private consumption and residential investment, resulting in stable projections for US economic performance in both 2016 and 2017",explain
"This news article discusses the success and potential of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in various cities around the world. BRT is a low-cost and high-impact transportation system that allows for efficient mass transit in urban areas.  The article highlights TransMilenio, a BRT system in Bogotá, Colombia, as a prime example of success. This system was completed in just three years and captured international attention due to its high capacity of over 40,000 passengers per hour. It operates through an innovative public-private partnership model, where the city builds the infrastructure and local entrepreneurs own and operate the fleet without subsidies.  The success of TransMilenio has led to its replication in many other cities globally. The article mentions that 150 cities have implemented BRT or bus corridors since 2000, with 115 created within this period alone. However, it emphasizes that planning, financing, and organizational difficulties are challenges that should not be overlooked during implementation.  The article stresses that each city is unique and requires tailored approaches instead of simply copying successful models from other places. It points out that most obstacles to implementing BRT systems are institutional rather than technical since they involve aligning diverse interests. Strong political leadership and effective communication are deemed essential for successful implementation.  Traditionally, urban transport planning has focused on expanding road networks instead of prioritizing people's mobility needs over cars'. The article argues against this approach as it leads to increased congestion rather than solving it. It cites examples like Seoul, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver removing urban highways to make way for public transport infrastructure as a more sustainable alternative.  Redirecting funding from parking facilities and highways towards sustainable transport initiatives is advocated by the author who supports mobility projects in Mexico, Brazil Peru Turkey India China among others countries while partnering with researchers from Chile USA Portugal Australia through ALC-BRT Centre of Excellence initiative.  The article also mentions upcoming projects such as a 150 km BRT network in Rio de Janeiro and the expansion of Metrobús in Mexico City. It predicts that around 30 cities, mostly in Asia but also Africa, will introduce BRT systems in the next five years.  The article notes a cultural shift where more people aspire to live in denser mixed-use areas within the city rather than commuting from the suburbs. Strategies aligning land use with transportation planning are highlighted as successful examples from Copenhagen, Curitiba, and Singapore.  In terms of innovations, vehicle technology is improving to make trains and buses more efficient and environmentally friendly. The goal is to create integrated public transport networks with last-mile connectivity to other transit services, as well as car and bike sharing options.  Lastly, it mentions growing trends such as membership-based urban lifestyles instead of ownership-driven ones thanks to social networks and car-sharing programs. However, Latin America seemingly demonstrates an opposite trend with a middle-class population increasingly owning cars while public transport usage declines. To address this issue, service improvements, safety measures requiring subsidies may be necessary alongside congestion charging initiatives and parking management schemes.  Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of implementing sustainable transportation systems like BRT globally due to their potential for positively shaping future cities while addressing mobility challenges efficiently.",explain
"This news article discusses the possibility of Portugal receiving a credit line from European countries to help support its economic recovery. The credit line is described as an appropriate instrument because Portugal has already been able to access the financial market by refinancing some bonds. The goal of the credit line is to assist Portugal in fully returning to the market and stabilizing its economy.  The article explains that a credit line is a less costly option for core countries (such as Germany) to provide, as it serves as a precautionary measure and may or may not be utilized by Portugal. A final decision on whether or not Portugal will receive this credit line is expected after the German elections in September.  Portugal is projected to face a funding gap of approximately 12 billion euros in 2014 when its current bailout program ends. The country has been struggling with a severe recession, with its GDP contracting by 1.8% in the last quarter of 2012 and an estimated further contraction of 3% in 2013. Unemployment rates remain high at around 17.5%.  One of the challenges facing Portugal is limited domestic demand, with reliance on external trade being necessary for economic growth. However, Spain (Portugal's main trading partner) also faces economic difficulties, which adds further pressure on Portuguese exports.  European officials have already revised down Portugal's deficit target for this year from 6% of GDP to 5.5%. This adjustment reflects a shift towards prioritizing structural reforms over immediate deficit reduction measures, which has been praised by Credit Suisse analyst Axel Lang.  Portugal implemented labor market reforms last year aimed at facilitating easier hiring and firing processes for employers - one example of successful structural reforms according to Lang's research note.  However, austerity measures continue to burden Portugal's economy heavily, and there have been recent setbacks due to budget cuts being rejected by the Constitutional Court. Lang anticipates that filling future budget gaps may present greater difficulties for the government, especially amid weak economic conditions, rising unemployment, social discontent, and political risks.  To counter these challenges, Portugal's leaders have been focusing on fostering economic growth. Measures such as cutting corporate taxes and providing incentives for foreign companies to invest in Portugal have been announced recently. The hope is that attracting large companies similar to the Irish model could improve employment prospects and enhance Portugal's business environment.  Overall, whether or not Portugal receives a credit line from European countries is significant in determining its long-term success. Reversing its status as one of the slowest-growing economies in the Eurozone will require time and concerted efforts from both domestic policymakers and support from international partners. In addition to the economic challenges Portugal is facing, the article also highlights the impact of spending cuts on essential services such as hospitals and schools. The government has acknowledged that these cuts will have an effect on public services, indicating the difficult choices that need to be made in order to address the country's financial situation.  The frustration regarding austerity measures has been growing among the Portuguese population. As a response, Portugal's leaders have been making efforts to stimulate growth and create a favorable environment for businesses. The announcement of measures such as corporate tax cuts and incentives for foreign companies to invest in Portugal reflects this strategy.  The article mentions that Portugal aims to replicate the Irish model, where attracting multinational corporations helped boost employment and improve economic prospects. Such initiatives demonstrate a recognition of the need for long-term structural changes aimed at promoting sustainable growth.  However, reversing Portugal's economic situation does not happen overnight. The country's long-term success hinges on its ability to fully recover from its recessionary state over the past decade. This requires implementing effective reforms, fostering domestic demand alongside external trade expansion, addressing unemployment rates, mitigating social discontent, and managing political risks effectively.  As mentioned earlier in the article, whether or not Portugal receives a credit line from Europe is crucial in determining its path towards recovery. Accessing this credit line would provide additional support during a critical time when existing bailout funds are set to end.  It's important to note that countries like Germany may be more inclined towards providing a precautionary credit line rather than outright grants or further financial assistance due to their own fiscal constraints amidst challenging economic conditions within Europe.  In conclusion, this news article highlights how receiving a credit line could potentially aid Portugal in stabilizing its economy by allowing it access to necessary financial resources during an ongoing recession. However, it also acknowledges that reversing years of slow growth requires significant structural reforms and sustained efforts on multiple fronts including fiscal consolidation with smart expenditure management techniques along with strategies promoting business investment and job creation.",explain
"This news article discusses the concerns surrounding the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) balance sheet, which has reached a record level of 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of massive foreign exchange purchases during the euro crisis. Despite economic data pointing towards deflationary trends, there are fears that this development could lead to uncontrollable inflation and distort savings and investment decisions in the private sector.  The article dismisses the idea of reintroducing simple, mechanical rules for central bank behavior, such as a return to the gold standard. It argues that historical evidence shows that adherence to rigid rules during times of crisis can increase economic instability. The Taylor rule, which proposed using interest rates based on capacity utilization and inflation rates to achieve stable inflation targets, is also criticized for failing to prevent severe economic imbalances.  Instead of focusing solely on the size of central banks' balance sheets, the article suggests that improving financial stability requires attention to be given to the entire financial system's balance sheets. It mentions an initiative called ""full money"" that aims to prevent commercial banks from creating money through lending by requiring all assets to be financed by central bank money. However, it argues that this approach would nullify decentralized information systems brought about by competition between financial companies and would not prevent future crises as ""shadow banks"" could still create money.  The article suggests that strengthening capital bases and increasing responsibility for banks and financial institutions are more effective approaches in addressing risks associated with lending and money creation. It highlights Switzerland's efforts in strengthening its financial stability through regulatory measures.  From a regulatory standpoint, the article raises concerns about political pressure on central banks if they were solely responsible for money creation under a full money system. It argues that maintaining market-driven banking systems with stronger boundaries between monetary authority and financial regulation is preferable.  It also warns against potential misallocations of capital due to policies like government bond purchases by central banks leading to speculative bubbles. The article proposes two pillars for regulatory policies: strengthening the independence of central banks from politics and ensuring long-term fiscal stability through mechanisms like the debt ceiling.  In conclusion, the article emphasizes the need to address concerns about inflation, financial stability, and potential misallocations of capital in a comprehensive manner without relying on simplistic rules or solutions. It advocates for a balanced approach that considers various factors and reinforces both the independence of central banks and fiscal responsibility. The article further expresses concerns about the blurred boundaries between monetary and financial policy since the financial crisis, leading to an increased fear of inflation. It argues that when central banks buy government bonds, they effectively finance government deficits and make it easier to refinance debt. This policy, coupled with rising asset values, can potentially lead to the misallocation of capital and speculative bubbles.  In response to this mixing of monetary and financial policies, the article suggests two key pillars for regulatory measures. Firstly, it recommends strengthening the independence of central banks from political influence. By ensuring that central banks are free from political pressures, they can make unbiased decisions based on economic considerations rather than short-term political interests.  Secondly, the article advocates for fiscal policy obligations to maintain long-term fiscal stability. It mentions a successful approach in Switzerland where a debt ceiling is built into their constitution. Expanding this concept to other areas like financing social welfare could reduce pressure on monetary policy by promoting responsible fiscal management.  Despite these suggestions, the article acknowledges that many industrialized countries face significant challenges in managing their debt dynamics. It suggests that these challenges may hinder efforts towards maintaining long-term fiscal stability and increase reliance on monetary policy as a problem-solving tool.  Overall, the article highlights several risks associated with current macroeconomic conditions and raises important questions about how best to address them. It cautions against simplistic solutions or rules for central bank behavior but emphasizes comprehensive approaches that strengthen financial stability while maintaining independence for central banks and promoting responsible fiscal policies.  It concludes by suggesting that a realistic assessment of debt dynamics is crucial in understanding potential risks facing industrialized nations today. By acknowledging these risks and adopting appropriate measures within both monetary and fiscal domains while respecting institutional boundaries, countries may be better equipped to navigate complex economic challenges in a more stable manner",explain
"This news article discusses the implications of using social media in the financial industry, specifically in banking. It explores various possibilities and challenges associated with leveraging social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter for marketing purposes.  The article suggests that social media can provide banks with a competitive advantage by allowing them to quickly understand market trends and consumer sentiment. This real-time information can be valuable in making informed decisions and staying ahead of their competitors. Additionally, it mentions that banks in non-retail sectors can also use social media to build brand awareness and differentiate themselves from their competitors.  The concept of crowdfunding and social lending is also discussed as alternative developments in the industry. These methods require specific social media strategies tailored to different sectors, highlighting the need for a customized approach rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.  However, one challenge mentioned is measuring return on investment (ROI) when investing in social media. The article argues that despite the potential benefits brought by engaged customers who derive greater satisfaction from financial services provided through social media channels, it is difficult to accurately quantify the value generated by these investments due to regulatory constraints and lack of conclusive metrics.  Another viewpoint presented in the article is that traditional advertising methods, such as billboards or television ads, often reach a broader audience than necessary for high-end financial services. In contrast, targeting communications through social media allows firms to focus on engaging prospects who have shown interest by actively choosing to follow or like their pages.  Regulatory hurdles are acknowledged as potential hindrances for financial firms' adoption of social media marketing efforts. However, it is suggested that digital platforms actually make certain compliance requirements easier through automated recording of all digital communications.  The article also highlights how consumers increasingly prefer higher quality services delivered quickly at lower costs through digital means such as mobile devices. It mentions that individuals are more likely to use platforms like Twitter as personalized information sources instead of sharing specific financial account details publicly on Facebook or Twitter statuses.  Overall, this news article emphasizes the potential benefits and challenges associated with utilizing social media in the financial industry. It recognizes the need for tailored strategies, regulatory compliance, and effective measurement of ROI while also acknowledging the opportunities for targeted communication and customer engagement offered by digital platforms. The news article goes on to mention the views of various individuals within the financial industry regarding social media and its impact.  One individual, Yuan Jun Lim, believes that engaged customers are more likely to derive satisfaction from financial services offered through social media. However, there is still debate over whether social media can directly boost a company's bottom line. Lim points out that measuring the return on investment in social media is challenging due to the lack of a direct and viable method to accurately quantify its value.  On the other hand, Maggie O'Toole argues that traditional marketing methods often reach a wider audience than necessary for high-end financial services. She suggests that social media allows for more targeted communication and engagement with prospective customers. By opting in or expressing interest through likes or follows, individuals essentially self-identify as potential customers.  Addressing regulatory concerns, O'Toole notes that some challenges faced by financial firms in using social media may be self-imposed rather than legal constraints. While there may be calls for rules and content review processes, digital platforms actually make meeting certain regulatory requirements easier due to automated recording of all digital communications.  Hugh Jorgensen offers another perspective by highlighting how consumers today seek higher quality service at a faster rate at lower costs. The use of handheld devices has become instrumental in providing this sense of control over their surroundings through the use of their fingers. Jorgensen emphasizes that if he were able to monetize this emotion as a financial service, he would not give it away for free.  Jorgensen also brings up an interesting point about how most people's connection between financial services and social media tends to revolve around more targeted advertising rather than sharing specific details about savings accounts or investments publicly on platforms like Facebook or Twitter. He predicts growth in using platforms like Twitter as highly personalized information sources tailored towards specific interests or industries such as following commodity experts or farmers when investing in certain markets like corn futures.  In conclusion, this news article sheds light on the potential benefits and challenges associated with leveraging social media in the financial industry. It emphasizes the need for tailored strategies, regulatory compliance, accurate measurement of ROI, and the ability to target communications effectively. While there are differing opinions on social media's direct impact on financial firms' bottom line, it is clear that social media platforms offer opportunities for customer engagement and more focused marketing efforts in an increasingly digital world.",explain
"This news article discusses the impact of containerization on global trade and the global division of labor since its introduction in the 1960s. The use of containers has revolutionized the shipping industry by eliminating the need to handle goods individually, saving time and money.  The article begins by highlighting how the introduction of containers increased trade volume by almost nine times in the northern hemisphere within a span of 20 years. Port workers' productivity also saw a sharp increase as handling pieces individually became unnecessary. For example, British ports could now handle 30 metric tons of goods per hour, which was over 15 times more than before.  The article acknowledges that while containers may seem logical and obvious today, they were initially seen as impractical due to expensive adjustments required. Container ships cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods, with container cranes costing millions and each container itself being thousands of dollars.  Despite these challenges, Australia was one country besides the US to adopt containers in domestic transportation initially before international usage began in 1966. As standardization took place with container sizes, making transfers between different modes of transport easier, more countries started building port infrastructure for containers in subsequent years.  While broad usage was initially led by US military shipments for wars like Vietnam and Cold War purposes during the late 1960s, providers offering partial containers contributed to wider adoption later on. This allowed smaller companies to utilize containers even if they didn't require an entire one.  Although only around 15 percent of maritime trade volume is transported in containers today, it represents over half of total trade value due to high-value electronics being transported this way compared to commodities like wheat or oil that are not typically containerized.  The center of container trade shifted towards Asia during the early millennium. Asian-North American routes became crucial for trading with just under 22 million standard containers transported in 2012. Asia-northern Europe routes followed closely behind with over13 million containers transported. Asia also houses nine of the ten largest ports, with seven being located in China.  The article mentions that the container industry experienced growth until the financial crisis of 2008, which led to a decrease in container trade volume and ongoing challenges with overcapacity and falling prices. Despite these challenges, larger and more cost-efficient ships capable of carrying over 18,000 containers are being launched.  In response to overcapacity issues, major European shipping companies plan to form alliances to divide up shipping routes and improve efficiency. However, regulatory approval is still pending. Smaller competitors are also considering similar alliances. These consolidations could offer customers a wider range of routes and services while potentially increasing trade integration.  Ultimately, the impact on prices will be influenced by efficiency improvements resulting from alliances formed between shipping providers. Lower rates may be offered as a result of increased efficiency while aiming to squeeze out smaller competitors.  In conclusion, this article highlights how containerization has revolutionized global trade since its introduction in the 1960s. It discusses the benefits it has brought in terms of time-saving, cost reduction, increased productivity at ports, and its role in shaping global division of labor. It also touches upon current challenges faced by the container industry such as overcapacity issues and falling prices due to economic conditions.",explain

"This news article discusses the importance of sleep and the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on our physical and mental health. It explains how lack of sleep affects our ability to think properly and drive safely, leading people to rely on stimulants like caffeine to stay awake during the day. However, this can make it difficult for them to fall asleep at night. As a result, they may turn to alcohol or sleeping pills to induce sedation, but these don't allow for the necessary biological process of sleep.  The article also highlights that even though we may not be conscious during sleep, we still need it for its numerous benefits. Lack of sleep can affect our interpersonal skills and make us less empathetic towards others. It can also lead to depression as sustained stress from a lack of sleep activates the body's stress response.  Sleep deprivation has also been linked with suppressing the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. Additionally, insufficient sleep increases the risk of weight gain and obesity as sleepy individuals tend to have higher levels of ghrelin hormone which makes them more likely to eat carbohydrates.  Moreover, as we age, our sleeping patterns change. Younger individuals tend to be night owls whereas older people become morning types due in part to changing sex hormone levels over time.  The human body clock operates on a cycle slightly longer than 24 hours so it needs daily adjustments in alignment with external factors such as light exposure. Light plays a critical role in regulating our internal clock; hence traveling across time zones often results in jet lag where various bodily clocks are out-of-sync until readjustment occurs.  To combat jet lag when traveling westward, seeking morning light is recommended while avoiding morning light but seeking afternoon light is advised when crossing more than six or seven time zones eastward. The use of melatonin as a supplement can aid in adjusting sleeping patterns when transitioning between time zones; however its exact biological impact is still not fully understood.  The article concludes by emphasizing the significance of sleep and suggests seeking out morning light for travelers going west and avoiding morning light for those traveling eastward. It further mentions that taking melatonin can help falling asleep quicker in a new time zone but recommends consulting with a doctor before doing so.  Overall, this news article highlights the importance of prioritizing adequate sleep for optimal physical, mental, and emotional well-being, while providing insights into how sleep deprivation can impact various aspects of our lives. In addition to emphasizing the importance of sleep, the article raises important concerns about individual differences in sleep needs. While there is variation in how much sleep each person requires, some individuals may falsely believe that they don't need much sleep due to chronic fatigue. This has been observed among nighttime taxi drivers who claim not to be tired despite suffering from significant sleep loss. Such misconceptions can have serious consequences, particularly for night-shift workers who may be impaired without realizing it.  To better understand an individual's natural sleep-wake cycle, the article suggests considering what happens on their free days and during vacations when they have more control over their sleeping habits. These periods can provide a clearer reflection of their true internal body clock timing. As we age, our sleep patterns naturally change as well. After the age of 10, we tend to go to bed progressively later and become night owls during our teenage years. However, this trend reverses around the age of 55 as we return to waking up and going to bed earlier, similar to our pre-puberty years.  The human body clock operates on a cycle slightly longer than 24 hours. Even in constant darkness and temperature conditions like being inside a cave, individuals would still fall into a regular rhythm of sleeping and waking; however, they would gradually shift their schedule by approximately 30 minutes each day due to this extra time in the internal cycle. This phenomenon mirrors what people experience during jet lag when adjusting between different time zones.  During jet lag adjustment periods, various clocks throughout our bodies (such as those found in the brain, liver, stomach) become temporarily out of sync with one another until they realign with external time cues provided by light exposure at the new location. The re-synchronization process typically takes about a day for every time zone crossed.  The article offers simple advice for travelers: when traveling westward seek morning light whenever possible since adapting to an expanding day is easier. Conversely, when traveling eastward and facing a contracting day, it is suggested to avoid morning light for three days at the destination and instead seek out afternoon light. These recommendations are based on the understanding that exposure to specific light signals can help reset our internal body clock more effectively.  While many people turn to melatonin as a supplement to aid in adjusting their sleep patterns, the precise biological impact of melatonin is not fully understood. It is known that melatonin production increases during nighttime when it's dark. Taking melatonin supplements provides the body with an artificial ""dark signal,"" potentially enhancing the effects of light on resetting our body clocks. However, more research is needed to definitively establish its mechanisms and efficacy.  Recent findings from a study published in the journal ""Cell"" shed light on why it takes time for our bodies to adapt to new light-dark cycles when traveling across time zones. Understanding this process could significantly improve strategies for managing jet lag in the future.  In summary, this news article sheds important insights into the significance of sleep and its impact on various aspects of our lives such as cognitive function, emotional well-being, physical health, and even safety while driving. It also delves into individual differences in sleep needs and provides tips for coping with jet lag based on adjustments to environmental cues like light exposure. By understanding these factors better, we can improve our management of sleep-related issues and promote overall health and well-being. ",explain
"This news article is about the Swiss tennis players Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka. Following the Indian Wells tournament, they were jointly leading the annual ranking called ""Race to London,"" which ranks players based on their performance throughout the season. They were followed closely by Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.  The article mentions that Federer and Wawrinka, also known as ""Fedrinka,"" had a successful run in the Davis Cup, winning against Serbia and Kazakhstan. This led Switzerland to its first semifinal since 2003, giving them a chance to reach the competition's final for only the second time in history.  The article then goes on to discuss their performance during the clay season. Both players had some ups and downs but managed to maintain their positions in the Race to London rankings. Federer missed a couple of tournaments due to personal reasons, including his twin sons' birth, while Wawrinka struggled with early exits from several tournaments.  Despite their different performances on clay, both players are still considered strong contenders heading into Wimbledon Championships. The article highlights Federer's dominance on grass courts with his numerous title wins at Wimbledon and Halle. On the other hand, Wawrinka has a negative record on grass but expressed confidence in his preparation for this year's Wimbledon.  Tennis expert Heinz Günthardt believes that if Wawrinka gets through the first week of Wimbledon successfully, he could go far in the tournament. However, Federer is widely regarded as stronger and recently won another grass court tournament at Gerry Weber Open.  The article concludes by mentioning that neither player has much pressure heading into Wimbledon as they both experienced unexpected early losses in previous years' tournaments. Despite this, they continue to support each other's successes and use them as motivation for themselves.  Overall, this news article focuses on Federer and Wawrinka's current rankings in the Race to London, their performance in the Davis Cup, and their prospects for Wimbledon Championships. The news article also discusses the historical success of Federer on grass courts. He is considered the ultimate ""grass king"" with 14 grass titles, including seven Wimbledon titles and seven Halle titles. His record on grass is impressive, with 125 victories and only 18 defeats throughout his career.  Wawrinka, on the other hand, has not had as much success on grass courts. His record shows 15 victories and 19 defeats, indicating a comparatively weaker performance on this surface. However, Wawrinka remains optimistic about his prospects at Wimbledon this year, stating that he has never been able to prepare for grass as much as he has this time.  Swiss tennis expert Heinz Günthardt believes that if Wawrinka can have a strong start and survive the first week of Wimbledon, there's no reason why he couldn't win the tournament. Despite his past struggles at Wimbledon, Wawrinka has reached the last sixteen in previous years and should not be underestimated.  While Federer still holds a higher ranking than Wawrinka in the Race to London standings, both players are well-positioned to reach the season finale in November in London. The article emphasizes that they support each other rather than seeing each other as rivals. Federer frequently expresses himself as Wawrinka's biggest fan while Wawrinka acknowledges Federer's achievements and uses them as inspiration for himself.  The article also mentions some recent events related to Nadal and Djokovic leading into Wimbledon. Nadal lost his first game in a preparation tournament while Djokovic entered Wimbledon without playing any preparation matches. This could provide an advantage to both Federer and Wawrinka at the beginning of their grass season.  In conclusion, despite their differing records on grass courts, both Federer and Wawrinka have had notable successes recently leading up to Wimbledon Championships. They continue to support each other and are considered strong contenders in the tournament. The article highlights their positions in the Race to London, their performances in the Davis Cup, and their prospects for Wimbledon, showcasing the bond between these two Swiss tennis stars.",explain
"This news article discusses the current economic situation in Switzerland and its impact on interest rates. The forecasts from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and major economic research institutes indicate negative growth for the current year, with only marginal increases in inflation over the next two years. If these predictions turn out to be accurate, Switzerland would be one of the few countries in the world to continue offering positive net yields.  Since August 2011, investors have accepted negative yields at auctions of Swiss government money market claims. Recently, these yields reached -0.79 percent. The article raises the question of why investors would choose to accept negative yields not just in money market investments but also for longer-term investments. The answer is multifaceted.  Firstly, there has been a renewed rise in risk aversion among investors due to concerns about Greece and Spain's debt problems. This has led to a flight towards secure investments such as Swiss francs. Secondly, from non-Swiss investors' perspective, investing in Swiss francs provides diversification for their portfolios. Additionally, passively managed assets contribute to this phenomenon of negative yields because they tend to stick with their positions regardless of price.  Another contributing factor is the flow of funds into indexed products, which is met with relatively illiquid markets. This compels investors with passively managed portfolios to invest at unsustainable yield levels. In recent years, the Swiss Federal Finance Administration has repaid more debt than it has issued government bonds for sale—a result that leads to a scarcity of available bonds.  In this context, active portfolio management offers flexibility advantages since an active investor or asset manager can employ strategic structuring and more flexible allocation based on duration and credit spreads beyond what would be permitted for passive portfolios. This enables them greater chances of generating higher returns than those offered by passive investment models.  The article concludes by discussing whether Swiss franc interest rates will continue falling or if there will be a change in direction. The author expresses confidence that the SNB is both able and willing to maintain the minimum CHF/EUR exchange rate of 1.2, which was set in September 2011. This commitment has been reaffirmed by the SNB after its recent assessment of monetary policy.  The Euroswiss futures market further supports the credibility of the SNB's monetary policy, as it implies negative money market interest rates for at least another two years. However, due to ongoing market tensions, the author suggests that the SNB may need to make significant efforts to defend this exchange rate. It is noted that sight deposits from banks with the SNB have increased by approximately CHF 37 billion since mid-May, indicating a potential deployment of funds required to defend this exchange rate.  Overall, given these circumstances and increasing market tensions, it is believed that the prospect for further drops in interest rates has diminished while there is an elevated risk of rising interest rates on the horizon.   The article suggests that the current economic situation in Switzerland, as indicated by negative growth forecasts and marginal inflation increases, has created a unique circumstance where the country still offers positive net yields compared to many other countries worldwide. This is significant because in most cases, investors expect to receive positive returns on their investments rather than accepting negative yields.  The fact that investors are willing to accept negative yields in Swiss government money market claims and potentially for longer-term investments begs the question of why they would choose such options. The answer lies in a combination of factors. Firstly, there has been a surge in risk aversion among investors due to concerns over the debt problems faced by Greece and Spain. In times of uncertainty, secure investments such as Swiss francs become more attractive.  Secondly, for non-Swiss investors, investing in Swiss francs serves as a diversification element within their portfolios. By including assets denominated in different currencies like the Swiss franc, they can reduce their exposure to risks associated with any one particular currency or country's economic performance.  Passively managed assets also contribute to the phenomenon of negative yields because these types of investment funds typically do not actively adjust their positions based on market conditions or price fluctuations. Instead, they maintain fixed allocations regardless of changes happening around them.  Another factor driving negative yields is the flow of funds into indexed products combined with relatively illiquid markets. Indexed products aim to replicate certain market indexes or benchmarks and invest accordingly. As more money pours into these products, it creates a demand for underlying assets even if prices are not attractive from an investor's perspective. This forces passive portfolios into accepting lower yields that may not be sustainable over time.  Furthermore, Switzerland has seen a situation where its federal finance administration has repaid more debt than issuing new government bonds for sale leads to limited availability of government bonds for purchase—creating scarcity.  In this context, active portfolio management becomes advantageous because it allows greater flexibility compared to passively managed portfolios. Active investors or asset managers can make strategic decisions to structure their investments and allocate their assets with more flexibility in terms of duration (the period until a bond matures) and credit spreads (the yield difference between bonds with different credit ratings). This can potentially generate higher returns than the passive investment model.  The article then shifts focus to whether Swiss franc interest rates will continue falling or if there might be a change in direction. The author expresses confidence in the SNB's ability and willingness to maintain the minimum CHF/EUR exchange rate of 1.2, which was established back in September 2011. This commitment has been reiterated by the SNB following its recent assessment of monetary policy.  Additionally, the Euroswiss futures market provides further evidence that supports the credibility of the SNB's monetary policy. The market implies negative money market interest rates for at least another two years, indicating that investors expect this to be maintained.  However, given ongoing tensions within financial markets, it is likely that defending this exchange rate will require significant efforts from the SNB. Sight deposits from banks held by the central bank have increased by approximately CHF 37 billion since mid-May, signaling potential large-scale funds necessary to uphold this minimum exchange rate.  In conclusion, based on these dynamics and considering escalating market tensions, it is suggested that while further drops in interest rates may not be imminent, there is now an increased risk of rising interest rates as circumstances evolve.",explain
"The news article consists of six questions, each with multiple choice options. Let me explain the context and the answers for each question.  Question 1: The question asks about the probability that a blue cab was involved in an accident. However, there is no information provided in the article to determine the color of the cab involved in the accident. Therefore, it is impossible to say what color the cab was.  Question 2: In this question, you are given two jars. Jar A has 50 white balls and 50 black balls, while Jar B contains an unknown number of black and white balls. You are asked to choose a jar and take out a ball. If it is black, you will win 100 Swiss francs.  Since Jar A has an equal amount of white and black balls (50 each), there is a higher chance of picking a black ball compared to Jar B's unknown composition of balls. Thus, it is more likely that you will win by choosing Jar A.  Answer: Choose Jar A.  Question 3: Two scenarios are presented regarding exposure to pathogen X that can lead to quick and painless death within one week:  a) You have been exposed to pathogen X with a likelihood of contracting this disease at exactly 0.1 percent, but there is a vaccine available that can prevent it. b) A professor conducting research on pathogen X provides an experiment opportunity for participants where they also have a chance (0.1 percent) of contracting the disease without any vaccine available.  In both cases, you are offered compensation for participating or being vaccinated against pathogen X. The question asks how much compensation (in Swiss francs) would be acceptable or how much you are willing to pay for vaccination/participation.  This decision depends on personal values and preferences; however, without additional details about individual circumstances or financial capability/burden associated with payment/compensation options provided in these scenarios, it is difficult to determine a suitable answer. Therefore, it is subjective and depends on personal choice.  Question 4: The question provides information about a group of people where eight out of 1,000 have cancer. Among those with cancer, seven will test positive for cancer, whereas among the 992 people who do not have cancer, 70 will still test positive.  To determine the number of people who test positive and actually have cancer, we compare the number of true positives (people with both cancer and positive tests) with all positive tests:  Out of the eight people with cancer: - Seven will test positive (true positives).  Out of the total population: - Seven true positives + 70 false positives = 77 people tested positive.  Therefore, out of all people who tested positive (77), seven actually have cancer.  Answer: A) Seven out of 77 people  Question 5: Two scenarios describe different events resulting in bird deaths due to petroleum spills in the ocean:  a) An oil tanker collision causes over 1,200 bird deaths. b) Natural oil seepage from earth's crust results in over 1,200 bird deaths.  The question asks about how serious these events are for the environment. The seriousness can be subjective; however, one can infer that an oil tanker collision might be considered more serious than natural oil seepage since human activities are involved.  Answer: a) The effect is likely to be serious or disastrous (depending on personal interpretation). b) The effect may be considered unfortunate or at most serious but not necessarily disastrous compared to an intentional human-caused event like an oil tanker collision that resulted in heavier ecological harm/impact on birds and marine life forms.  Question6: This question assesses how likely certain statements are true based on provided information about Linda's background:  A - Linda is active in the feminist movement B - Linda is a bank teller C - Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement  Since no information is provided indicating whether Linda is still involved in these activities or if she has pursued any specific career, it becomes difficult to determine a precise likelihood for the statements.  Therefore, without more context about Linda's current activities or profession, it is impossible to assign probabilities (0 to 100) to these statements.

"This news article discusses the phenomenon of shopping and consumerism in China, with a particular focus on Shanghai. It highlights how shopping has become a popular leisure activity for people in China, especially on weekends. The article emphasizes that the idea of shopping alone is not common in Chinese culture, as material fortune is often seen as something to be shared with relatives and friends.  Despite having a relatively modest per capita income of around $6,600 a year, even individuals with lower incomes are willing to spend money on high-end products. The article mentions examples like taxi drivers who own expensive mobile phones. This suggests that indulging in luxury goods is not limited to any specific social strata.  Shanghai is portrayed as the epitome of China's consumer boom. It is described as leading the country's transition towards consumerism, while Beijing focuses more on conservative political lobbying and Guangzhou focuses on industrial production.  The article also notes that Shanghai has attracted global retail players who have expanded their presence in China from this city. Moreover, it mentions other notable features such as tall buildings, the stock exchange, ports, airports, a Formula One race circuit, and Expo 2010.  In Chinese culture, flaunting wealth is seen as chic rather than vulgar. The CEO Asia Pacific of Montblanc states that their clients are typically well-educated entrepreneurs or executives who value high-quality luxury goods. Chinese consumers conduct extensive research before making buying decisions by considering factors such as product origin and brand history.  The article highlights that an increasing number of Chinese can afford luxury items like watches and leather goods sold by brands like Montblanc. The wealthiest 10% of households have experienced significant growth in wealth over recent years and now account for over 35% of total household income.  As Chinese consumers become more affluent, they exert an influential impact on the global market for high-end consumer goods. Luxury brands have recognized this trend and are expanding their operations accordingly. For example, Montblanc plans to triple the size of its store in Shanghai's CITIC Square.  The article also mentions that even lower-income brackets in China are experiencing moderate growth in their financial situation. The rising income levels of different income groups are seen as a potential driver for future consumption growth. With the declining savings rate and the focus on the younger generation, known as ""Little Emperors,"" who grew up as single children under China's one-child policy, brands see them as high-spending consumers with significant purchasing power.  Overall, this news article showcases the growing consumerism and shopping culture in China, particularly in Shanghai. It highlights how Chinese consumers are willing to spend on luxury goods regardless of their income level and how brands are targeting this market with larger stores and more competition among retailers. The article further explains that the growth in consumerism and shopping culture is fueled by various factors, such as increased wealth, rising income levels, and changing attitudes towards consumption. It notes that even the lower-income brackets in China have experienced moderate growth in their financial situations since 2005.  Additionally, the article mentions a decline in China's savings rate from 26% of income saved in 2004 to just 12% in 2009. This indicates a shift towards increased spending and consumption among Chinese consumers.  One significant factor contributing to the rise of consumerism is China's one-child policy introduced in 1980. As a result, most Chinese individuals under the age of 30 grew up as single children and received substantial attention from their families. These individuals are now being targeted by brands as high-spending consumers with considerable purchasing power. Referred to as ""Little Emperors,"" this generation has seen strong growth in income opportunities.  The article also suggests that Chinese consumers value not only the product itself but also its origin and brand history. They conduct thorough research before making purchasing decisions, emphasizing quality luxury goods.

"This news article discusses the impact of reduced consumer spending in the United States and the potential for emerging market growth to offset this decrease. The article highlights that if US consumption returns to its long-term average, there could be a reduction in spending of around $1.4 trillion per year. This cutback represents over 7% of US annual GDP and 1.6% of global GDP, which would need to be compensated for if global growth is to return to its trend level.  The article suggests that emerging markets may offer a solution to this problem. It states that for the first time, emerging economies now account for more than half of global GDP on a purchasing power parity basis. The International Monetary Fund predicts that these markets will grow at an average annual rate of 5.3% through 2014, significantly higher than the expected growth rate of advanced economies.  Furthermore, emerging economies often have lower debt levels and higher foreign exchange reserves compared to many advanced economies. With an estimated combined purchasing power of over $18 trillion and representing around 82% of the world's population, these markets offer significant potential for increased consumption-led growth.  The article notes that while many corporate strategies have focused on serving the emerging middle class with incomes between $3,000 and $20,000 per year, there is a large untapped market consisting of approximately four billion people living in relative poverty (earning less than $3,000 per year). This segment represents the base or bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) consumers who have been largely neglected by corporate strategists.  However, targeting BoP consumers comes with its own unique challenges. These citizens spend a significant portion (over 80%) of their income on essential items like food, clothing, and fuel with little left for discretionary spending. They also often lack access to reliable credit facilities, telecommunication services, electricity or clean water due to their rural locations.  Accessing BoP consumers is challenging due to their isolation and limited options. This isolation has led to the ""poverty penalty"" phenomenon, where poor people in isolated regions often pay a premium for basic goods and services compared to those living in more competitive markets.  Despite these challenges, some private companies have successfully engaged with the BoP market by adapting their strategies to meet the unique needs of these consumers. One example highlighted is the concept of single-use packaging, where companies provide small, affordable packages of products like detergent and shampoo that are suitable for the BoP market.  In conclusion, this news article emphasizes the importance of emerging markets as potential drivers of global growth, particularly with reduced consumer spending in advanced economies. While targeting BoP consumers can be challenging due to their specific circumstances and limited resources, companies that tailor their offerings to these markets can find success. The article further discusses the potential of the bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) market segment and its significance in the post-crisis world. With a population of four billion people, representing over 60% of the world's population, the BoP segment cannot be ignored due to its sheer size. Despite living in relative poverty, these individuals have a combined purchasing power estimated at $5 trillion.  Comparatively, this figure is comparable to the estimated $12.5 trillion purchasing power of wealthier emerging market segments with incomes between $3,000 and $20,000 per year. This indicates that companies should start paying more attention to this large consumer market if they wish to tap into growth opportunities in the post-crisis world.  However, engaging with BoP consumers comes with its own set of challenges. Firstly, these consumers spend most of their income on essential items like food and clothing. Therefore, they have little discretionary income left for other types of spending.  Additionally, most BoP consumers are located in rural areas and lack access to basic services such as credit facilities or telecommunication services. Some may not even have access to electricity or clean water. These challenging conditions make it difficult for companies to reach and serve these consumers effectively.  Moreover, due to their isolation from mainstream economic markets with limited competition for goods and services in their regions, BoP consumers often face higher prices known as the ""poverty penalty."" This means that they end up paying significantly more than wealthier individuals for similar products or services.  Despite these challenges associated with targeting BoP markets successfully, some private companies have managed to find success by adapting their strategies accordingly. These firms cater directly to BoP consumers by offering unique products or services tailored specifically towards their needs.  One notable example is single-use packaging where companies provide affordable packages containing small quantities of products such as detergent or shampoo that are suitable for consumption by individuals living within constrained budgets.  In conclusion, while reduced consumer spending in the United States poses challenges for global growth, emerging markets, particularly the bottom-of-the-pyramid segment, offer potential solutions. However, tapping into this market requires companies to address unique challenges such as the limited discretionary income of BoP consumers and their isolated locations with limited access to basic services. Nevertheless, success can be achieved by customizing products and services to meet the needs of these consumers effectively.",explain
"This news article discusses the establishment and purpose of a forum in Switzerland that aims to highlight the importance of a strong financial center for the country's future as a business location. The person behind this initiative is described as someone who was approached by individuals who sought someone outside of parliament to lead this effort.  The article mentions that the decision to support and participate in this forum was easy for the individual, as they strongly believe in the qualities and significance of the Swiss financial center. The goal of creating a ""communication platform"" involving members of parliament and specialists from the financial sector is also mentioned. While businesspeople and employees are welcome to join, membership needs to be limited to keep the forum manageable.  The article points out that within its relatively short existence (less than three years), the forum has been successful in generating public interest on various topics it covers. It states that they have achieved positive impact which continues to expand over time.  Regarding banks' role in providing loans, it is suggested that while there may be instances where being denied can be challenging during difficult circumstances, banks themselves have learned through experience about lending practices. Successful financial institutions will adapt well, with larger banks leveraging their size advantage while smaller ones thrive as niche players.  Although not directly stated, it becomes clear from further reading that this forum also expresses opinions on matters related to both general politics and those impacting Switzerland's financial center specifically. The article emphasizes on exercising careful consideration before making any statements so as not to jeopardize their fundamental commitment.  One key issue discussed is Switzerland's relationship with European Union (EU) member states concerning free movement of persons. A ""No"" vote regarding this could endanger agreements crucial for Swiss economy outlined under ""Bilateral I"". In alignment with economic circles, individuals linked with this forum express support for extending free movement with EU countries due to its potential positive impact on Swiss economy including the financial sector.  Banking secrecy is identified as an important factor contributing towards the success of the Swiss financial center, alongside political stability, moderate taxes, and asset management expertise.

It is emphasized that Swiss banking secrecy does not offer protection to criminals and has been actively involved in combating money laundering and terrorism financing.  Overall, the article provides an overview of a forum established to advocate for a strong Swiss financial center as essential for Switzerland's future business prospects. It also touches upon related topics such as lending practices, issues concerning the EU relationship regarding free movement of persons, and the importance of banking secrecy. Furthermore, the article highlights the belief that protecting banking secrecy is crucial for the survival of the Swiss financial center. It mentions that this protection not only contributes to the success of the center but also reflects a national commitment to privacy and individual rights. The article goes on to state that Switzerland takes pride in its role as a leader in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, asserting its dedication to maintaining ethical practices within its financial sector.  The individual behind this forum emphasizes that efforts should be made to ensure the survival of banking secrecy.

"This news article discusses various aspects of Russia's economic growth and potential challenges. It highlights the recent nomination of Alexander Konovalov as the new Minister of Justice, succeeding Vladimir Ustinov, indicating a potential change in emphasis in certain key positions. The article argues that Russia's growth rate can remain strong if necessary structural reforms are implemented, particularly modernizing the country's judiciary and bureaucracy. Tackling widespread corruption is also deemed essential.  The article suggests that while Russia has vast reserves of natural resources like oil and gas, allowing for continued growth even without structural reforms, it would be at a slower pace. It emphasizes the need for diversification in the economy to sustain a broader growth base beyond relying solely on its energy supply.  The wealth distribution in Russia is highlighted as an area where improvements could be made. While acknowledging that the broad population has benefited from economic growth over the past decade, it argues for a fairer distribution of wealth.  Commodity prices are discussed with reference to their impact on Russian economic development. The article notes that commodity prices have declined relative to their value over the past century but have rapidly risen over the last seven years, particularly energy prices serving as a major lever. This highlights both opportunities and challenges for Russia due to its significant energy assets.  In terms of Russia's financial sector, there has been an inflow of assets into banks and an increase in investment sophistication among middle-class clients. However, high-net-worth individuals in Russia tend to be closely connected with their businesses compared to Western counterparts who often separate ownership from management.  The role of President Medvedev is discussed regarding his ability to decide which ministers he wants to work with and his authority in implementing reforms. However, it remains uncertain how much he can achieve given significant capital influxes driven by oil and gas prices into the Russian economy - finding ways to absorb this money without causing inflation is seen as crucial.  The author believes that despite investors talking about business opportunities in India and China, Russia offers the highest return on investment. However, it is also pointed out that Russia's situation is distinct from other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) economies due to its higher per capita income, smaller population size, and a different mentality influenced by its location in the north.  In conclusion, this article highlights the importance of structural reforms for Russia's sustained economic growth while acknowledging its natural resource reserves as a valuable asset. It discusses wealth distribution concerns and offers insights into the financial sector and investor sentiments. The role of President Medvedev in implementing reforms amid capital influxes poses challenges for future economic development. The article raises important questions about the political focus of Alexander Konovalov, the newly appointed Minister of Justice. It emphasizes that Russia cannot be directly compared to other BRIC economies like India and China due to its unique characteristics, including higher per capita income and a smaller population. These factors contribute to a different economic landscape and require tailored approaches for sustained growth.  The author acknowledges that Medvedev, as the Russian president, has considerable authority in selecting ministers. However, it remains to be seen how much he can achieve in the short and medium term considering the significant financial inflows driven by soaring oil and gas prices. Finding ways to implement structural reforms that encourage investments without causing inflation is a challenging prospect.  Furthermore, the article discusses the need for diversification in Russia's economy beyond its reliance on energy exports. While oil and gas resources have played a crucial role in driving economic growth, there is recognition of potential risks associated with this heavy dependence. A broader growth base would help mitigate these risks while ensuring long-term stability.  The wealth distribution issue is another key concern discussed in the article. While economic growth has positively impacted a broad section of society over the past decade, there are concerns about fairness and equity in wealth distribution throughout Russia. It suggests that efforts should be made towards more egalitarian wealth distribution policies.  The financial sector observations shed light on investment trends and clientele behavior within Russia. The influx of assets into banks indicates increasing confidence among investors while highlighting growing sophistication among middle-class clients who invest both domestically and abroad.  Interestingly, high-net-worth individuals in Russia are presented as being closely connected with their businesses compared to their Western counterparts who tend to separate ownership from management roles. This demonstrates unique characteristics within Russian business dynamics but also hints at potential challenges regarding governance structures and corporate transparency.  In terms of external investment perspectives on Russia's market opportunities, the author argues that although investors may discuss business prospects more often regarding India or China – due to their significant population sizes – in reality, the highest return on investment is found in Russia. This highlights the attractive investment climate within the country, despite its distinctiveness compared to other BRIC economies.  To summarize, this article delves into various aspects of Russia's economic growth and some hurdles it may face. It emphasizes the importance of implementing structural reforms, addressing wealth distribution concerns, and diversifying the economy beyond reliance on energy resources. The role of Alexander Konovalov as Minister of Justice is seen as potentially influential, whilst considering President Medvedev's political focus amid capital inflows poses challenges for future development. Overall, while underscoring Russia's unique characteristics compared to other emerging economies, it also recognizes opportunities for investors in a changing economic landscape.",explain
"The news article discusses a project order given to a small group of architects for the renovation and redesign of the historic CS head office building, along with other buildings on Paradeplatz. The owners of the building were aware of their cultural responsibility due to its historical value as a listed building.  The future design of Paradeplatz needed to meet certain requirements according to an assessment report. It was important that visitors not only see the building from the outside but also experience it from within. The design should be stimulating, communicative, generous, and open. With these requirements in mind, Atelier 5, an architect's office, was chosen for the project.  Atelier 5 excelled in finding a balance between preservation and renovation while creating a welcoming space for the public. They had a subtle interaction with the existing structure and prioritized restoring it to its original state rather than imposing their own ideas. Denis Roy, the architect responsible for the project, emphasized that their planning was influenced more by the building itself and its history.  One notable aspect of Atelier 5's work was reopening an arcade that existed when Adolf Brunner built Lichthof in 1876 but had been closed during a major renovation in 1900 when it was converted into a banking hall. Now, after 100 years, this arcade has been reopened and is considered one of the most significant architectural interventions in the entire project.  The monumental edifice has also been opened up towards Bahnhofstrasse with a concealed connecting arcade that used to be part of the post office's main hall. This approach leads visitors through several archways before arriving at Lichthof – a central point flooded with natural light from skylights overhead. The contrast between noisy Paradeplatz and Lichthof is striking; Lichthof provides an oasis-like atmosphere filled with peacefulness.  The actual entrance to Credit Suisse bank branch is now located where once stood the securities counter. This hall, in the form of a nonagon, was an extension of the banking hall at the turn of the century and is also a listed structure. The architects envisioned maintaining its historical significance by using it as the entrance to Credit Suisse.  In addition to these renovations, a high-class shopping arcade has been created within the building. Ten shops and a gourmet restaurant have opened their doors, including well-known brands such as Giorgio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, Bulgari, Montblanc, Bottega Veneta, and others.  The overall renovation project aimed to respect the historical importance of the CS head office building while creating an inviting space for visitors. Atelier 5's design choices focused on harmonizing with existing structures rather than overshadowing them with new elements. The reopened arcade and restoration of original features highlight their commitment to preserving history while adapting spaces for modern uses.  This transformation has not only restored vitality to Paradeplatz but also provided an assortment of high-quality stores that contribute to Zurich's reputation as an international shopping destination. The renovated CS head office is now not only visually appealing from outside but also offers an immersive experience when stepping inside – combining architectural beauty with contemporary amenities.",explain
"This news article discusses Bulgaria's economic progress and the challenges it still faces. It begins by acknowledging that while mistakes were made, the country has achieved some impressive successes in recent years. Simeon Sakskoburggotski, Bulgaria's former king and prime minister, praised the reforms initiated over the past five years for contributing to a relatively stable economic climate.  The article highlights some noteworthy achievements, such as consistent annual GDP growth of more than 5% since 2001 (reaching 6.2% and 6.1% in 2005 and 2006 respectively). Additionally, inflation has significantly decreased from a record high of 2,000% in early1997 to approximately 4%, while unemployment has dropped from nearly 20% in 2000 to below 10%.  Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski expresses optimism regarding the success of these economic reforms and emphasizes their recognition by all political parties as crucial for maintaining long-term stability regardless of who is in power next.  However, despite these accomplishments on an economic front, it would be inaccurate to compare Bulgaria's current position with countries like Poland, Estonia, or the Czech Republic. The nation continues to grapple with issues related to an inadequate judicial system, burdensome administration processes, and corruption scandals that persistently make headlines.  The low GDP per capita ($3,480 USD) in comparison to other countries included in the latest accession round further demonstrates that there is room for improvement socioeconomically. Minister Oresharski admits that challenges remain: highly qualified labor shortages pose a threat to economic progress; however steps have been taken against corruption and administrative reform but more work needs to be done.  Bulgaria is described as a land of contrasts or shades of gray due to various experiences faced by investors like André Felder from Switzerland who runs a bicycle factory with considerable output here. Felder shares stories about deceitful business partners and institutionally driven quasi-bankruptcies. Despite these challenges, he believes that Bulgaria's situation has improved significantly in recent years and that it is a safe territory for his real estate investments.  This positive change has led to increased speculative activity among potential investors who are attracted by the country's solid currency, falling interest rates, relatively stable political situation, and rising stock prices. The article suggests that EU membership will continue to stimulate growth in Bulgaria. Foreign investors' interest is expected to grow alongside the flourishing of domestic industries due to outsourced labor-intensive manufacturing processes. Moreover, improvements to infrastructure are anticipated through EU structural and cohesion funds.  The article concludes by acknowledging the jubilation expressed by Bulgarians on New Year's Eve regarding their country's future but cautions against being overly optimistic. Minister Oresharski acknowledges the population's eagerness for benefits stemming from EU membership but emphasizes the need for sustainable development. While progress has been made and promising signs exist, it is essential to ensure a solid foundation for continued growth.  Overall, this news article sheds light on Bulgaria's economic achievements while also providing an honest account of the challenges faced by the nation such as corruption scandals and administrative inefficiencies. It highlights both optimism about future prospects stimulated by EU membership as well as caution in maintaining sustainable development practices moving forward.",explain
"This news article discusses the importance of slowing down and taking a break in our fast-paced world. The author emphasizes the need to appreciate and reflect on the past, history, and classical music as a way to counterbalance our frantic lives.  The article highlights how nostalgia has become prevalent in our society today. Museums, days of remembrance, history books, and old music are all ways for people to connect with the past. The author believes that this craving for a slower pace of life is why there are so many cultural offerings related to memories and classical music.  The Festival mentioned in the article aims to bring together these two worlds - the present and the past - in an intriguing way. The program is designed to confuse listeners positively, challenging them to discern whether they are listening to music from centuries ago or compositions created recently. This creative approach intends for audiences to reflect upon and ponder these musical experiences.  The Festival also offers flexibility by allowing attendees to come and go as they please during concerts. This freedom mimics how every musical work contains pauses where surprising moments often occur. By providing opportunities for breaks within performances, this creates a space for unexpected encounters with art.  An interesting aspect of the Festival is its collaboration with various musicians and ensembles like the Chamber Choir, Davos School of Music, Swiss Army Band, among others. By merging different artistic backgrounds together on stage during performances conducted by Dalia Stasevska with cellist Nicolas Altstaedt and pianist Friedrich Gulda playing alongside musicians from the Swiss Army Band; acute attention will be drawn towards experiencing new soundscapes.  The Swiss Army's involvement arose when Ueli Maurer was approached regarding his ministry's responsibility over safeguarding careful study through listening - something deemed endangered by those involved in organizing this eventful festival – which lead him promising 120 soldiers in their capacity as musicians from their very own Swiss Army Band.  One important theme shared throughout this piece is the notion of youth. The author believes that being young is not just about age; it also encompasses a carefree, original, and unreflective mindset. By combining the perspectives and experiences of both young and old musicians, the festival aims to create a unique and enriching experience for both performers and audiences alike.  The festivals' intention is not merely limited to hosting concerts; it aspires to become a platform for inspiration, an escape from daily routines or responsibilities. It encourages open-mindedness among participants, fostering an environment where questioning assumptions and engaging in discussion are encouraged.  The article concludes by mentioning that the opening piece at the Festival will be ""Living Room"" composed by American composer John Cage. This piece symbolizes the potential for anything to happen within this welcoming space created by the festival organizers. Davos itself is described as one big living room with its doors wide open, inviting people from all walks of life to gather together.  The author recognizes that most profound experiences occur before and after concerts when individuals discuss their thoughts and reflections on what they have heard. Surprisingly, they even express their desire for listeners to get incredibly bored during performances because boredom allows time to pass slowly – an amazing phenomenon according to them.  Overall, this news article highlights how important it is for individuals in our modern world filled with hectic schedules and constant distractions, to pause, reflect upon history while enjoying classical music alongside contemporary compositions featured at this unique festival held in Davos.",explain
"This news article is about the creation and development of a unique luxury watch by the company HYT. The watch, called the H1, is a mechanical-fluidic hybrid watch that uses two flexible reservoirs filled with different-colored liquids to indicate the time. The concept was conceived by engineer and inventor Vouillamoz, who came up with the idea of using two liquids that repel each other to create a visually stunning display.  Vouillamoz teamed up with his friend Patrick Berdoz, an experienced entrepreneur in the medical technology field, to turn his idea into reality. They recruited additional engineers and together developed the first technical specifications for the watch. Emmanuel Savioz, another experienced start-up entrepreneur, also joined the team and they set up HYT company.  After a year of intensive research and development work, an initial prototype of the H1 was produced. However, before they could start producing luxury watches, they needed to overcome some challenges. Despite having no prior experience in the watch industry, they were able to hire CEO Vincent Perriard in 2010. Perriard had years of experience working for renowned watch companies such as Audemars Piguet and Concord.  The biggest challenges in creating this unique timepiece were finding an interface between the mechanical movement in the watch mechanism and fluid system, housing both systems in a confined space while ensuring perfect interaction between them. Additionally, they had to develop special fluids that meet requirements for resistance to vibration, knocks,and temperature fluctuations.  HYT also developed a special system for adjusting the time ofthe watc hhich prevents mixing ofthe two liquids by controlling their flow rate.Furthermore,the watch mechanism itself hadto be developed from scratch due too much space being taken up by thereservoirscontainingthe liquids.  The conceptofthisnewtypeofwatchwas presentedto variouswatch dealersand distributors starting from summer 2011.The H1 was finally presented to anenthusiastic audience at the Baselworld 2012 watch and jewelry fair. The watch was well-received, with many dealers and collectors paying upfront for their orders, which is unusual in the watch industry.  HYT has already started working on successor models totheH1, includingtheH2,H3,and H4. The target audience for these watches mainly consists of collectors andwatch aficionados from around the world.  To bring their product to market successfully, HYT received funding from SVC Ltd., a renowned investor specializing in risk capital for SMEs. This funding helped HYT deliver on advance orders and further expand their operations to fully exploit the potential of their innovation.  In addition to creating luxury watches, HYT's technology has also opened up new possibilities in other industries. They have acquired unique expertise in microfluidics through the development of the H1 watch, which could be applied to areas such as accurate injections in the medical sector or fragrance diffusion.  Overall, this news article highlights how engineer Vouillamoz's initial idea was transformed into a unique luxury watch through collaboration with experienced entrepreneurs and engineers. The challenges faced during development were overcome by leveraging expertise within different industries. HYT's success with the H1 has opened doors for future innovations and opportunities beyond just luxury watches.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of the Swiss economy and provides analysis and projections for the future. The article begins by stating that while only 7 percent of voters expect their personal well-being to decline, two-thirds believe that their situation will remain unchanged. These survey results are consistent with economic indicators showing a moderate level of optimism but also some pessimism in the fall of 2014.  The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which measures the expansion or contraction in Switzerland's industrial sector, indicates continued growth. However, expectations for economic growth have declined since spring due to various factors. One major reason is a slowdown in the eurozone caused by Italy and France slipping back into recession, which has affected Germany, Switzerland's most important trading partner. Additionally, conflicts in Ukraine have led to a drop in German exports to Russia and Eastern Europe.  Germany's economic problems have had a significant impact on Switzerland's export industry, along with persistent economic slowdowns in China and other emerging markets. These negative effects cannot be offset by the relatively weak US economy.  Despite these challenges, Switzerland has been successful in weathering turbulence within Europe thanks to what is referred to as the ""super cycle"" in its domestic economy. This super cycle can be attributed to low interest rates set by the Swiss National Bank and increased demand for credit-financed residential property and durable goods.  The overall impact on Switzerland's economy will depend on two key questions: whether global growth will return soon and if the super cycle within Switzerland's domestic economy can continue or come to an abrupt end at some point.  Regarding global growth prospects, there are fundamental considerations suggesting that it may remain fragile. High levels of private debt around developed countries coupled with increased public debt make it unlikely that governments will adopt policies promoting growth through investments. Cautious consumers and financial uncertainty also discourage substantial corporate investment. Geopolitical tensions further inhibit investment activity, especially during periods of economic instability when protectionism tends to increase.  Another concern is the progressive aging of the population, which limits growth in Switzerland and other countries.  In terms of the super cycle within Switzerland's domestic economy, there are concerns about increasing household debt as a result of persistently low interest rates and a real estate boom. Regulators are starting to address potential instabilities in the financial system caused by rapid loan growth.  In conclusion, while some moderate optimism exists about Switzerland's economy, there are also reasons for pessimism. Global economic conditions remain fragile due to various factors such as high private and public debt levels and geopolitical tensions. The future of Switzerland's domestic super cycle also poses challenges due to concerns over increased household debt. The article goes on to highlight the difficulty in achieving cooperative and efficient international solutions, especially in stabilizing the international financial system. The multipolar world, which has replaced the dominance of the United States and the West, is marked by ongoing geopolitical tensions that are unlikely to decline in the long term. This further inhibits investment activity.  Furthermore, there is a structural problem contributing to pessimism about Switzerland's future super cycle - the progressive aging of the population. As more people retire and fewer young workers enter the workforce, growth becomes limited.  Additionally, concerns over potential instability in Switzerland's financial system have prompted regulators to impose self-regulatory measures to curb loan growth and address areas of potential risk.  All these factors suggest a cautious outlook for Switzerland's economy. While there are still favorable conditions such as low interest rates stimulating domestic demand for goods and property, external pressures from global economic fragility and geopolitical uncertainties pose significant challenges.  The overall tone of the article leans towards pessimism regarding global economic prospects and potentially an end or slowdown in Switzerland's super cycle. The question of whether robust global growth will return soon seems uncertain due to fundamental considerations such as high debt levels and geopolitical tension.  While it acknowledges that Switzerland has shown resilience against past upheavals in Europe, it remains unclear if this can be sustained given current economic conditions. The article highlights various risks that could impact both domestic demand within Switzerland as well as external factors affecting its export industry.  In conclusion, this news article provides an analysis of survey results indicating moderate optimism from voters but also notes declining expectations for economic growth. It discusses various challenges facing both global economies and specifically Switzerland's domestic economy. The outcome remains uncertain but leans towards caution or even pessimism given existing uncertainties surrounding debt levels, geopolitical tensions, ageing populations, regulatory measures aimed at curbing loan growth and other structural concerns impacting future economic growth.",explain
"This news article discusses the anticipation surrounding the launch of Apple's new smartwatch, known as the iWatch or Apple watch. The article highlights that the watch is expected to be a revolutionary product and could potentially be worn by millions of people worldwide.  The article mentions that Apple was granted a patent for a ""wrist-worn electronic device"" by the relevant authority in the USA on July 22, 2014. Illustrated drawings titled ""iTime"" show a strap that allows for attachments to be clipped into it. It also states that production has already begun in Asia, according to industry consultant Robert Weiss.  The author points out that what sets Apple's watch apart from competitors is its integration with other devices such as iPhones and iPads. This compatibility with existing devices is seen as crucial for success in the market. The announcement of iOS 8 also showed that Apple is placing emphasis on health functions, leading analysts to speculate on potential medical applications for the device.  Discussions between Apple and the United States Food and Drug Administration have allegedly taken place regarding health-related functionalities, suggesting that one day users may even be able to buy an iWatch through prescription if it can measure vital signs like blood pressure.  Although other companies like Swatch have announced their own smartwatches, experts believe that Apple's product will stand out due to its integration with Siri voice-activated software and its ability to serve as a communication center within an ecosystem of other devices.  Surprisingly, despite discussions between Swatch Group and Apple about potential partnerships, it appears Swatch declined any involvement. Industry consultant Robert Weiss expresses his astonishment at this decision since Swatch possesses expertise in areas such as production technology which could have been beneficial for both companies.  Luxury conglomerate LVMH (Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton S.A.) also seems interested in exploring their own means of accessing this market but without ignoring the new product entirely.  Credit Suisse analyst Uwe Neumann believes that the iWatch cannot stand alone but rather needs to be integrated with Apple's existing products like the iPhone and iPad. He suggests that the watch will provide an incentive for consumers to buy other Apple devices, while also noting the importance of having a wide variety of compatible apps available as previous smartwatches have suffered from inadequate integration.  Neumann further speculates that a slimmed-down and cheaper version of the iWatch might initially enter the market, offering basic functionalities such as receiving emails from linked iPhones. He estimates that this introductory version could cost between $150 and $200, while a fully matured product would likely cost around $350.  Overall, this article emphasizes Apple's entry into the smartwatch market with its highly anticipated iWatch. It highlights potential features, collaborations, and competition in various sectors related to wearable technology. The article suggests that the entry of Apple into the smartwatch market could have an impact on other manufacturers, particularly in the low- and medium-price segments. Fitness wearable companies like Polar may face increased competition and potentially be affected by Apple's presence in the market.  However, despite potential competition, experts believe that Apple's strong brand reputation and existing customer base give them a significant advantage. The integration of their smartwatch with other Apple devices is seen as a key selling point, as customers already invested in the Apple ecosystem are more likely to consider purchasing an iWatch.  The article also mentions that some industry experts see the iWatch as more than just a watch; it is intended to serve as a communication center within the larger ecosystem of devices. Integration with Siri voice-activated software is seen as a particularly intriguing feature that sets it apart from other smartwatches.  While some skeptics may argue that there are already competing smartwatches available on the market, analysts believe that Apple's strong emphasis on integration and its ability to leverage its existing products will give them an edge over competitors.  In terms of production, speculation suggests that manufacturing has already begun in Asia.

"This news article discusses the career and performance of the young violinist Vilde Frang, who recently won a prestigious music prize. The article highlights her talent, maturity, and growth as a musician over the past few years.  The article starts by mentioning how winning this prize can launch a musician's career, as seen in the case of cellist Sol Gabetta. On the other hand, it can also expose the limits of a young musician. However, in the history of this particular prize, there haven't been any negative examples. It only showcases nuances between high and very highest levels.  Vilde Frang is described as someone who doesn't believe in perfection but instead strives to do better after every concert. She prefers taking risks while playing and accepting minor errors rather than aiming for perfection. This attitude has made her performances unique and captivating.  The focus then shifts to Frang's performance of Jean Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor at the Lucerne Culture and Convention Center. The article mentions that she had previously recorded this piece for EMI with another orchestra but now delivers a perfect rendition with conductor Bernard Haitink at this concert.  Frang's interpretation is described as having tension, emotionality, fire, ice- strength and silence - making it poetic and captivating for the audience. Despite any possible errors during her performance being unnoticed by most listeners.  It is mentioned that Frang debuted at the Lucerne Festival performing Sibelius' work back in 2009 with pianist Julien Quentin. This performance was inspired by an earlier experience where she reached the final but didn't win at Eurovision Young Musicians contest held in Lucerne in 2004.  The article then explores how Frang sees music as constantly evolving just like love does throughout life experiences and phases. She associates Sibelius' music with melancholy and desolation which resonates with her upbringing in Nordic landscapes even though she currently lives in Munich.  Overall, the article highlights Frang's growth as a musician and how her unique interpretation captures the emotions and essence of Sibelius' music. It also mentions her previous experiences, both successful and not-so-successful, which have shaped her musical journey. The article then mentions that Vilde Frang's performance of Sibelius' music is deeply influenced by her Nordic upbringing and the landscapes she associates with it. This connection to her identity adds another layer of depth and emotion to her interpretation.  It is mentioned that Frang debuted at the Lucerne Festival in 2009, where she performed Sibelius' three humoresques among other works, alongside pianist Julien Quentin. This performance was particularly significant for Frang as it followed a less successful experience at the Eurovision Young Musicians contest in Lucerne back in 2004.  Although not winning the contest, Frang made a positive impression on Michael Haefliger, who was a jury member of that competition and also serves as the Artistic and Executive Director of the Lucerne Festival. This encounter proved to be crucial for her musical future.  The article emphasizes that success does not always come immediately or through every endeavor but sometimes through learning from failure. Frang's earlier experience in Lucerne may not have been considered a failure in itself, but it ultimately became an important stepping stone towards her success as a musician.  In conclusion, this news article portrays Vilde Frang as an exceptional violinist with immense talent and maturation over time. Her unique interpretation of Sibelius' music showcases her ability to evoke emotions and captivate audiences. Despite setbacks early on in her career, she has persevered and continued to evolve both musically and personally.  Through her performances, Frang combines technical excellence with an emotional connection rooted in her Nordic upbringing. Her development as a musician is perceived as an ongoing process rather than striving for perfection alone.  Overall, this article celebrates Vilde Frang's achievement while shedding light on the journey she has taken thus far. It highlights how dedication, growth from past experiences, individuality in interpretation, and personal connection contribute to making remarkable musicians like Vilde Frang.",explain
"This news article discusses the concept of Islamic finance and its growing popularity in the global market. Islamic finance is based on the reconciliation of financial activities with Islamic law, also known as Sharia.  Sharia is derived from spiritual and legal sources such as the Quran (the holy book of Islam) and the Sunnah (the way of life of Prophet Muhammad). The Quran is considered by Muslims to be the word of God, while the Sunnah contains advice and rules on economic practices based on Muhammad's own experiences as a tradesman.  One of the key features of Islamic finance is its prohibition on Riba, which means interest or usury in Arabic. This reflects a broader historical distrust towards interest in many monotheistic religions including Judaism and Christianity. In ancient Jewish tradition, for example, interest was initially considered a sin but over time became more accepted through certain permissions for non-Jews to participate in interest-based lending.  Islamic finance not only prohibits interest but also has specific regulations regarding risk, speculation, gambling-like situations, and classifying certain business sectors as ""good"" or ""bad."" These rules aim to promote sustainable growth for local economies and reduce social disparities between rich and poor.  In addition to these principles, Islamic finance applies a negative screening approach to determine compliant business sectors. Some sectors that are not considered compliant with Islam include alcohol- tobacco- pork-related products production, conventional financial services sector, entertainment sector, weapons industry defense industry.  The history of Islamic finance dates back to experiments in Egypt during the 20th century but gained significant attention during the oil crisis in 1970s Middle East where new wealth prompted further development. Over time, institutions focused on developing an Islamic form of economic action emerged mainly in Gulf countries supported by organizations like the Islamic Development Bank founded In 1973.  In contrast to Middle Eastern markets that primarily served wealthy private banking clients and engaged in private equity activities; South East Asian markets embraced retail clients and saw wider adoption of Islamic financial services in the 1980s. However, until the end of the 20th century, Islamic finance had limitations due to the prohibition of direct interest, which limited complete banking services for Islamic clients.  This changed in the new millennium when Islamic institutions invested more in research and development. Consequently, the Islamic fixed income market grew, popularity increased for products such as Islamic mortgages and Sharia-compliant credit cards. This led to a fully-fledged Islamic financial service sector emerging by the end of last decade.  During this period, Sukuk (Islamic bonds) became popular among Middle Eastern and South East Asian companies as a means to raise capital in financial markets. The word ""Sukuk"" translates to ""deed"" or ""legal document"" and is derived from an old tradition of issuing documents to verify outstanding debt.  Overall, this article highlights how Islamic finance has evolved over time, becoming a significant player in global finance with its unique principles rooted in Sharia law. It also explains how different religious traditions have grappled with their own perception and regulation of interest-based financial activities.",explain
"This news article highlights the challenges facing the Swiss financial center and explores potential strategies for its future success. It mentions that financial centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dubai are experiencing growth and facing less international political pressure compared to Switzerland.  One of the main challenges faced by Swiss banks is increasing fiscal pressure on cross-border private banking, as well as declining profitability in private banking. Furthermore, regulatory developments in the US and EU have a significant impact on the Swiss financial center. These developments require Swiss financial institutions to adhere to national rules for market access.  To address these challenges, the report calls for proactive measures from various stakeholders such as financial institutions, policymakers, supervisory authorities, and academics. It emphasizes that embracing a business model based solely on tax-compliant money is essential for success. The regularization of past practices through tax treaties with partner nations is seen as indispensable.  The report suggests setting up a withholding tax agreement on future capital gains generated from assets invested in Switzerland as a sensible approach. It also argues that Swiss banks should take advantage of opportunities presented by domestic companies' banking needs. Currently, only a small portion of these transactions are captured by Swiss banks.  Additionally, there is potential for increased market share in trade finance since Swiss exports account for 54% of GDP. The report also identifies corporate financing and funding innovative companies or start-ups as areas where Swiss banks can expand their presence.  In terms of retail and private banking clients within Switzerland itself, there are opportunities to develop electronic and mobile banking products and services. Encouraging appropriate national legislation would enable leveraging these opportunities effectively.  The article mentions philanthropy, microfinance sustainable investments, impact investing as potential areas where Swiss banks can broaden their product offerings. Attracting investment managers like hedge funds and fund administration to relocate in Switzerland is another avenue worth exploring.  Swiss banks should improve access to new growth markets located in Asia, the Middle East,and Latin America by expanding their local presence in the region. The article highlights the need for investment in infrastructure to handle complex financial flows between developed and emerging markets.  Furthermore, Switzerland could aim to become the data and infrastructure backbone of the global financial services industry. This would require investing in reliable technical infrastructure and business systems for data storage and processing.  Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner presented a reform agenda called ""Switzerland as a Financial Center"" to initiate a constructive debate among all relevant stakeholders. The proposed measures aim to create a stable environment and avoid excessive regulation.  In conclusion, this news article discusses the challenges faced by Swiss banks, including fiscal pressure, eroding profitability, and increasing regulatory demands. It suggests various strategies for Swiss banks to remain competitive, such as focusing on tax-compliant money, regularizing past practices through tax treaties, expanding market share in various banking sectors (trade finance, corporate financing), developing innovative products/services like electronic/mobile banking or impact investing,and expanding into new growth markets globally. Ultimately,the goal is to strengthen Switzerland's position as a financial center through structural changes and collaboration between private sector players and government entities. ",explain
"This news article discusses the concerns surrounding sluggish global economic growth after major financial crises. The Vice Chairman of Global Fixed Income and Economics Research at Credit Suisse, Neal Soss, states that it is not unusual to experience periods of slow growth after a financial crisis as various entities retrench, including governments, businesses, financial institutions, and consumers. However, if this retrenchment phase lasts too long, it can lead to more permanent mediocre growth and a decline in investment incentives for businesses.  The article also highlights the potential negative consequences of prolonged sluggish growth. One concern is that the skills of long-term unemployed individuals may deteriorate to the point where they become permanently unemployable. Additionally, if sluggish growth continues without any new fiscal or monetary stimulus on the horizon, there is a risk that the potential of the economy will deteriorate.  The reluctance among world leaders to implement explicit fiscal stimulus due to concerns about public sector balance sheet leverage is causing further worry among economists. For instance, European officials have imposed strict austerity requirements on countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland as part of their bailouts. In the United States too, a combination of tax increases and spending cuts has helped reduce the budget deficit but has also limited economic stimulus measures.  Similarly in Japan and China efforts are being made to reduce deficits by implementing austerity measures and reducing credit availability respectively. Additional monetary stimulus seems unlikely as central banks like Federal Reserve are winding down quantitative easing programs while other central banks have not eased further as expected.  Despite all these factors contributing to short-term pain for different economies across various regions due to reforms or fiscal policies aimed at reducing deficits or containing inflation rates; some positive indicators suggest potential improvements in business spending which could revive global economic activity. US businesses have been recording record profits post-tax which indicates healthy corporate cash flow levels; however private domestic business investment remains weaker than pre-crisis levels suggesting caution among business leadership about medium- and long-term future prospects.  The article concludes by suggesting that an unexpected positive surprise or a few more months of encouraging economic data could potentially boost confidence and prove that the current recovery, although slower and weaker than expected, is sustainable.  Overall, the article highlights concerns about sluggish global economic growth after financial crises and the potential consequences if this situation persists. It also identifies various measures taken by different economies to reduce deficits and contain inflation but discusses how these actions have contributed to short-term pain. Finally, it suggests the need for increased business spending or positive economic surprises to revive global economic activity. In addition to the concerns about sluggish economic growth and the potential risks associated with it, the article also discusses some specific measures taken by various countries in an attempt to revive their economies.  For example, China is trying to rebalance its economy by shifting its focus towards domestic consumption. This shift is expected to create a more sustainable growth model that is not reliant on risky local government borrowing financed by shadow banking. However, this transition has resulted in a decline in China's GDP growth, which is even lower than the government's own forecast.  Another example provided is India's aim to bring down inflation from an average of 8.4 percent since 2005 to 4 percent within two years. To achieve this goal, policymakers are implementing extremely conservative policies that are likely to restrict economic growth.  To counteract these challenges and stimulate economic recovery, increased business spending is suggested as a potential solution. The article highlights favorable conditions for businesses, such as record post-tax profits and high levels of corporate cash flow in the United States. Despite these positive indicators, however, private domestic business investment remains below pre-crisis levels. This cautious approach may be attributed to a lack of confidence among business leaders regarding medium- and long-term prospects.  The article concludes by posing possible solutions or factors that could boost confidence and strengthen the recovery process. It suggests that unexpected positive surprises or continued encouraging economic data could potentially provide the necessary impetus for businesses to invest and drive actual business activity.  In summary, this news article explores concerns surrounding sluggish global economic growth following major financial crises and highlights various measures taken by different countries in response. It emphasizes both short-term pain caused by fiscal policies aimed at reducing deficits or containing inflation rates and potential solutions such as increased business spending or positive surprises that could accelerate global economic recovery.",explain
"This news article discusses the slowing population growth in Switzerland over the past few decades, accompanied by higher life expectancy and lower birth rates. The country is projected to have a population of 7.9 million by 2030, and it is unlikely that the majority of this population will be ""truly"" Swiss.  In the mid-1960s, the average Swiss woman had 2.68 children. However, with the introduction of contraceptive methods like the pill, this rate decreased to 1.5 children by the middle of the 1970s. Today, Swiss women have an average fertility rate of 1.3 children, which is projected to decline further to 1.2 children by 2030.  To maintain a steady population size, an average of 2.1 children per woman is required; however, this figure is very close to current fertility rates for non-Swiss women living in Switzerland.  The article also highlights that both men and women can expect longer life expectancies in Switzerland. The average life expectancy for men will increase from 76.7 years to 81.8 years by 2030 and for women from 82 time time-subject crowdsourced information mins banned from Wikipedia six-part video

"This news article discusses the importance and role of financial markets in allocating global resources efficiently. It highlights how financial markets make money available to those who need it through investments, creating value and allowing everyone to profit.  The article acknowledges that while trillions of dollars were created in the financial markets, there have been instances where certain areas, particularly the stock market and technology sector, experienced a burst of the tech bubble leading to a destruction of value. However, diversification across different asset classes can help mitigate such effects.  The central theme explored is asset management and how expertise and experience play essential roles in generating and maintaining value in financial markets. The author stresses the need for comprehensive solutions that not only generate returns for clients but also manage their risks.  Different investment styles are discussed in terms of total return orientation versus returns based on equity and bond markets. Total return investors aim for positive returns every year while sacrificing some longer-term return potential. On the other hand, investors focused on market returns are willing to endure negative years but have a longer time horizon to capture risk premiums offered by financial markets.  The article emphasizes that it is crucial for investors to decide on an investment plan or style and stick with it rather than constantly switching strategies based on short-term performance fluctuations. Switching strategies often leads to dropping performance levels and increased transaction costs.  The concept of risk is explored as being subjective; different individuals perceive risk differently. Portfolio fluctuation is identified as one form of risk along with the probability of falling short of desired long-term returns. The article notes that equities tend to be riskier than investment-grade bonds; however, diversification across various assets, regions, countries, styles, and issuers can help mitigate some risks.  While systematic risk cannot be eliminated entirely from portfolios through diversification alone, accepting higher levels of remaining risk may potentially result in higher long-term returns.  The importance of having a structured investment process is highlighted by the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) mentioned in the article. A structured investment process serves as a check on the work of investment professionals and allows for the consideration of various factors that determine the value of different asset classes.  The CIO takes responsibility for asset allocation in discretionary mandates, determining how much to invest in bonds, equities, cash, or alternative investments. They also decide on allocation within different sub-asset classes such as credits, hedge funds, or private equity.  The Investment team continuously monitors markets and factors influencing them—including valuations, economic indicators, quantitative models output—and incorporates these results into their investment process. The decisions are then discussed within a committee comprised of senior management at Credit Suisse along with other bank strategists before being implemented into mandate portfolios.  The article concludes by highlighting that while mistakes can be made in the profession of asset management like any other field; having a structured and comprehensive approach helps reduce potential errors. The author emphasizes the importance of teamwork and constant monitoring to make informed decisions aligned with clients’ goals.  Overall, this news article provides insights into various aspects related to financial markets’ role in allocating resources efficiently and highlights key considerations for successful asset management.",explain
"This news article discusses the evolution and history of drive-through banking and its relationship to the fast food industry. It highlights the claim made by Jack in the Box, a fast food chain founded by Robert Oscar Peterson, that they opened the world's first drive-through restaurant in San Diego in 1951, thus inventing the fast food industry.  The article notes that while drive-through restaurants became popular in the US, it was actually Dallas, Texas that saw the opening of the first drive-through bank in 1938. The Hillcrest State Bank is credited with introducing this new type of banking facility. In Switzerland, drive-through banking also gained popularity quickly with notable success at Paradeplatz.  However, as traffic congestion increased and preferences shifted over time, drive-through banking began to decline. In 1983, SKA (Swiss Credit Management AG) finally ended its experiment with drive-through banks due to lack of profitability caused by decreased customer interest.  Despite this decline in Switzerland, America still maintains a strong culture of using drive-throughs for various services including banking. Major banks like Citibank,Bank of America,Bank One continue to offer nationwide options for customers through their ATMs or even traditional counter services accessible from a driver's window.  The article also mentions Asia as an up-and-coming market where drive-through banks are gaining traction due to increased car ownership rates. Additionally,it highlights how technology is now merging two concepts: McDonald's has partnered with British Telecom to provide wireless broadband access zones at some UK locations. This allows customers who are eating at McDonald's restaurants to use their own devices for internet banking and other online activities while enjoying their meal.  Finally,the author humorously adds that this trend could potentially give rise to ketchup-resistant notebooks as people may accidentally spill condiments on their devices while multitasking between eating and managing their finances.  In summary,this article explores how drive-thrus have become prevalent not only within fast-food establishments but also in the banking industry. It charts the history of drive-through banking from its early roots in the US to its decline and potential resurgence in Switzerland and other markets around the world. The article also highlights how advancements in technology, such as wireless internet access, are further merging fast food and banking services for convenience-seeking customers. The article raises an interesting question regarding which came first: the drive-through bank or the drive-through restaurant. While Jack in the Box claims to have pioneered the concept of a drive-through restaurant in 1951, records show that drive-through banks actually opened much earlier, with the first one opening in Dallas, Texas in 1938.  This discussion about the timing of these innovations leads to a reflection on the history and impact of fast food and banking. The article mentions that drive-through banking lagged behind fast food by approximately 13 years. This highlights the significance and influence that fast food had on shaping consumer behavior and expectations.  It is also worth noting how both industries capitalized on America's love affair with cars. The rise of car culture provided fertile ground for these businesses to flourish, allowing people to conveniently access their meals or conduct financial transactions without leaving their vehicles.  However, while drive-through restaurants continued to thrive in America, especially amidst a busy lifestyle and reliance on convenience, Switzerland faced challenges with its own drive-through banking model due to growing traffic congestion in downtown Zurich during the '70s. As a result, fewer customers were willing to make pit stops at underground bank locations for cash withdrawals.  Nevertheless,the article suggests that technological advancements have breathed new life into this concept.It cites examples like ATMs,making payment transactions by mail or phone banking as alternate ways through which customers access banking services beyond traditional branches.The potential resurgence of drive-thru banks is also highlighted,suggesting that Swiss customers may once again embrace this convenient form of service delivery if modernization is introduced and traffic concerns are addressed.  Additionally,the article expands its viewpoint towards Asia as an emerging market where cars are becoming more prevalent.This hints at possible opportunities for further growth and adoption of such innovative concepts across different regions around the world.  The integration of wireless broadband access zones at McDonald's further exemplifies how technology continues to evolve methods for accessing services.Communications infrastructure advancements enable customers to conduct internet banking activities with ease while enjoying a meal at one of these locations.  In conclusion, the article provides a historical overview of drive-through banking and its connection to the fast food industry. It sheds light on the different timelines for their emergence and highlights the enduring popularity of drive-through services in America. It also considers how technological advancements continue to reshape traditional methods of service delivery and explores potential opportunities for growth in different markets.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state and future prospects of Africa, as well as its relationship with Europe and China.  The article begins by acknowledging that Africa has long been neglected but is now experiencing significant growth. However, in order to overcome its problems, it requires support. The article mentions prominent African figures such as Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan who have made a positive impact, along with President Mubarak of Egypt who has been an international figure for many years.  The European approach towards Africa varies among countries but is generally disappointing. Some European countries are actively involved in providing aid, conflict prevention, and addressing issues like drug exports and counter-terrorism. Trade still exists between former colonial partners; however, there are difficulties stemming from old resentments from the colonial era. These resentments are diminishing over time.  The author believes there should be greater symbiosis between Africa and Europe. Europe represents a significant market for African raw materials and products while Africa presents a long-term investment opportunity for European capital.  China's presence in Africa is also highlighted. China is actively involved in various parts of the continent, especially countries like Sudan or Angola where they have substantial contracts for buying oil. Additionally, China invests in infrastructure projects tied to aid using Chinese partners and contractors which improves African infrastructure significantly. Their interest extends beyond oil to minerals, forests in Congo, and arable products in other countries.  Economically speaking, African growth currently averages at around 6 percent with Angola being the fastest growing country globally presently. There is potential for Africa to narrow the gap on growth with mature Western countries due to continued demand for its commodities like food, oil, and natural resources; however reaching parity will take time compared to much of the rest of the world.  To achieve sustained growth and improved quality of life for Africans entails addressing key challenges such as political stability (eliminating corruption), AIDS healthcare provision ,and mitigating climate change impact on food production which has the potential for adversity. The article emphasizes that political stability is crucial for sustained growth and development.  The diversity of Africa's strengths is highlighted, including an abundance of oil, minerals, arable products, and human resources. However, these strengths vary between countries.  Addressing ancient feuds and political instability are cited as the biggest dangers facing Africa. The elimination of corruption in several countries will be critical in ensuring wealth is effectively utilized to underpin prosperity.  Sport plays a role in bringing people together in Africa as well. Africans have a great affinity for sports evident by achievements like South African cricket, remarkable athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia, and success in soccer seen through the African Nations Cup where many stars also excel in professional leagues like the English Premier League.  The author expresses a desire to attend the FIFA World Cup scheduled to be held in South Africa in 2010 but cannot confirm plans yet. Nevertheless, they are certain about visiting various African countries before then due to personal enjoyment derived from such trips.  Overall, the news article highlights Africa's growing significance economically but underscores the need for addressing fundamental problems such as political stability and healthcare provision while emphasizing opportunities for closer partnerships with Europe and acknowledging China's influential role on the continent.",explain
"This news article is a personal account of a conductor named Lorin Maazel, who reflects on his journey as a musician and the meaning of fame. Maazel shares that he started his musical career as a child prodigy during World War II, playing various instruments and studying composing. However, in his late teens, he felt the need to explore other subjects such as literature, history, philosophy, and languages. He worked during the day playing violin in the Pittsburgh Symphony while attending night school at the University of Pittsburgh.  Maazel explains that his performances with renowned conductors during this time unknowingly shaped his future in music. These experiences convinced him that his path would continue to be in music just as it had been in childhood. He then talks about fame and how it is merely what others think or know about you beyond your close circle of family and friends. Whether known by 50 people or 50 million people, Maazel suggests that fame has no inherent value.  According to him, he experienced fame at a young age but found that people eventually lost interest in him as a young adult. This realization led him to understand the ephemeral nature of fame and how many great artists throughout history have been forgotten over time. Therefore, Maazel believes that obsessing over one's legacy or place in history is irrelevant for performers.  He emphasizes that performers should focus on communicating their knowledge of music with people at present moments rather than worrying about their future recognition. As an experienced conductor himself, he dismisses the opinions of critics who know nothing about music.  Maazel then discusses the personality traits necessary for success as a conductor: excellent memory and preferably perfect pitch; ability to perform publicly while believing in the audience; desire to open musical vistas for listeners; respect for composers; helping musicians find purpose and worthiness through their dedication to practicing; earning respect instead of imposing it; motivating musicians musically while incorporating individual expression into a larger structure.  In conclusion, Maazel believes that classical music, rooted in religiosity and compassion for the human experience, should be approached with sensitivity and understanding. He values the collaboration between conductor and musicians to create a harmonious blend of colors and phrasings that align with his guiding hand.  This article serves as an insight into the personal experiences, reflections, and insights of Lorin Maazel as a conductor. It provides an understanding of his musical journey, views on fame, and thoughts on what it takes to be a successful conductor. The article delves deeper into Lorin Maazel's perspective on the role of a conductor in a musical performance. He emphasizes the importance of meeting the musicians' expectations professionally to gain their respect. Rather than imposing his own viewpoint, Maazel seeks to incorporate their individuality into a larger structure, resulting in a diverse range of musical expressions that mesh well due to his guidance.  Maazel also mentions his belief that classical music should be approached with reverence for its origins and the composers who have shaped it. He sees himself as a facilitator, someone who helps musicians realize the purpose and value behind their years of practice and technical expertise.  Furthermore, he recognizes that each musician has their own way of making music and expressing themselves. In order to create cohesive performances, Maazel strives to incorporate personal musical views within an overarching structure while maintaining musical coherence and logic.  When there is disagreement between himself and an individual soloist regarding musical interpretation or viewpoint, he prefers quiet discussions to explain his reasons rather than imposing his own opinions. However, Maazel notes that more often than not, what first chair players bring to the table is of exceptional quality.  Concluding his reflection on conducting, Lorin Maazel considers classical music's roots in religiosity and compassion for humanity. He believes that performers should focus on communicating these aspects with audiences at each given moment rather than obsessing over future recognition or legacy.  The article provides valuable insights into Lorin Maazel's growth as a musician from prodigious child performer to esteemed conductor. It highlights his understanding of fame as transient but also questions society's perception towards fame by pointing out how great artists can be forgotten throughout history.  Moreover, it offers guidance on what makes a successful conductor - from technical aptitudes like memory and perfect pitch to having respect for composers while motivating musicians musically through incorporating their unique expressions into collective performances.  Overall, this news article serves not only as an account of one person's experiences but also as a thought-provoking reflection on the nature of fame, the purpose of performers, and the role of a conductor in creating memorable musical experiences.",explain

"mark.  Several factors have contributed to this increase in global household wealth. Firstly, the global economy has been slowly recovering from the financial crisis of 2008. Many countries have implemented economic stimulus measures and structural reforms that have helped restore stability and confidence in the markets. This has led to growth in asset prices, particularly in equities and real estate, which are major components of household wealth.  Secondly, emerging markets have played a significant role in driving global wealth growth. Countries like China and India have experienced rapid economic expansion over the past decade, leading to an increase in incomes and living standards for their populations. As a result, these individuals have accumulated more assets and contributed to the overall rise in global wealth.  Furthermore, advancements in technology and increased access to financial services have made it easier for individuals around the world to save, invest, and grow their wealth. Online trading platforms and mobile banking applications enable people to participate in financial markets regardless of their location or income level. This democratization of finance has opened up opportunities for individuals across all segments of society to build their personal wealth.  However, it is essential to highlight that not all regions or population groups have benefited equally from this increase in global wealth. Disparities exist both within countries as well as between different geographic regions. Developed economies tend to have higher levels of average personal wealth compared to developing economies due to factors such as higher wages, stronger social safety nets ,and access advanced financial services.  Moreover , there are persistent gender disparities when it comes personal wealth accumulation . Women often face greater challenges accessing credit , investment opportunities or even receiving equal pay for equal work . Addressing these inequalities is crucial not only for social justice but also for unlocking the full potential of human capital around the world .  Looking ahead , there are both opportunities and risks that could impact global household wealth trends . On one hand , continued economic growth is expected across many regions which will likely support further increases n asset prices and overall wealth . Emerging markets , in particular , are projected to continue growing at a faster pace than developed economies.  On the other hand , there are potential risks that could disrupt the positive trajectory of global wealth. Geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts, and natural disasters can create volatility in financial markets and impact asset values. Moreover , rising income inequality is a persistent challenge that could limit the ability of individuals to accumulate wealth and contribute to social unrest.  In conclusion, global household wealth has reached new all-time highs despite ongoing economic challenges. Factors such as economic recovery, emerging market growth, technological advancements, and increased access to financial services have contributed to this trend. However, disparities in wealth distribution persist both within and between countries. Addressing these inequalities will be crucial for ensuring sustainable global prosperity in the future. Additionally , potential risks such as geopolitical tensions and income inequality should be carefully managed to safeguard continued growth in household wealth worldwide",continue
"saw a slowdown in growth due to government budget cuts and spending constraints.  However, it is expected that Swiss industries can expect some positive developments in 2015. One of the key factors that will drive growth is the strengthening of foreign trade. Despite some setbacks in 2014, Switzerland's export-oriented industries are poised for a comeback. The global economy is forecasted to improve, particularly in major trading partners such as the United States and European Union. This will create new opportunities for Swiss manufacturers and exporters.  The manufacturing sector, which suffered from a slowdown last year, is expected to rebound strongly in 2015. With improving global demand, companies can anticipate higher production levels and an increase in orders from abroad. Moreover, the weak Swiss franc has also made exports more competitive and attractive for international buyers.  A particular area of strength for Swiss industries lies in precision engineering and high-tech manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, and electronics. These sectors have always been reliable sources of revenue for Switzerland due to its highly skilled workforce and innovative technologies. In 2015, these sectors are likely to continue attracting investments both domestically and internationally.  Another positive outlook for Swiss industries comes from increased government spending on infrastructure projects. Recognizing the need to stimulate economic growth after a period of stagnation, the government plans large-scale investments in areas such as transportation networks and renewable energy systems. This will not only create jobs but also boost demand for materials and services provided by local businesses.  Furthermore, Switzerland's renowned financial services industry should not be overlooked when considering future prospects. Despite facing challenges due to international tax regulations and increased competition from other financial centers like London or Singapore,  Switzerland remains a hub for wealth management services thanks to its stable political climate,  strong banking secrecy laws (although these have been eroded over recent years),  and expertise accumulated over centuries.  Additionally,  the country’s solid reputation built upon trustworthiness  and transparency continues  to attract wealthy individuals and corporations looking  for safe havens to protect their assets.  Although the sector may experience some adjustments  in response to global financial regulations,  Switzerland's financial services industry is projected to remain resilient,  creating opportunities for growth and innovation in 2015.  While there are positive indicators for Swiss industries, challenges remain. The country's high immigration rates have led to a surge in population growth, putting pressure on housing and infrastructure. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding European Union relations could impact trade agreements and market access.  In conclusion, Swiss industries can expect a mixed bag of opportunities and challenges in 2015. The strengthening of foreign trade, particularly with key trading partners like the United States and European Union, will drive growth in export-oriented sectors. Manufacturing, precision engineering, high-tech industries are likely to rebound strongly. Increased government spending on infrastructure projects will create new job opportunities and boost demand for local businesses' goods/services. The stable political climate and reputation of Switzerland's financial services industry should also contribute positively to overall economic prospects. However, challenges related to population growth and EU relations need careful consideration moving forward. ",continue
"This trend of increased consumer confidence and spending in emerging markets is a reflection of various economic factors. Firstly, the rapid urbanization and industrialization in many emerging economies have led to a significant expansion of the middle class. As more people move from rural areas to cities, their disposable income increases, fueling consumption.  Additionally, improved access to credit and financial services has played a crucial role in driving consumer spending. Many emerging market consumers now have easier access to loans and credit cards, enabling them to make larger purchases that were previously out of reach.  Furthermore, advancements in technology have played a pivotal role in increasing consumer confidence and fostering a culture of online shopping. With internet penetration on the rise in many emerging markets, consumers now have access to an array of products at competitive prices. This has not only expanded their choices but also made shopping more convenient.  Moreover, economic stability and robust GDP growth rates in many developing countries have positively impacted consumer confidence levels. As these economies continue to grow at a steady pace, consumers feel more secure about their financial futures and are therefore willing to spend more.  Another important factor contributing to the growth of consumer expenditure in emerging markets is changing demographics. Younger populations with high aspirations for better living standards are driving demand for goods and services across various sectors such as housing, automobiles, smartphones, and travel experiences.  The rebalancing from developed market consumption towards emerging market consumption has far-reaching implications for global businesses. Companies that can effectively tap into these growing consumer markets stand poised for significant growth opportunities. However, understanding local preferences and adapting business models accordingly is crucial for success.  For multinational corporations seeking entry into these markets or expanding their existing presence further, it is imperative that they develop localized strategies tailored specifically to each region or country within an emerging market. Adapting products or services according to local tastes will help gain stronger customer acceptance.  Lastly- engaging with local communities through corporate social responsibility initiatives can build trust among consumers. Emerging market consumers tend to favor companies that display a genuine commitment to environmental sustainability, social impact, and ethical business practices.  While the rebalancing of consumer growth between developed and emerging markets certainly presents diverse opportunities for businesses, it is not without its challenges. Political instability, currency fluctuations, regulatory barriers, and cultural differences can all pose obstacles to success.  Nevertheless, with the continued rise in consumer confidence and expenditure in emerging markets, businesses that are able to navigate these challenges effectively will reap substantial rewards. The rebalancing of consumer growth towards these markets is reshaping the global economic landscape and providing exciting opportunities for both local and multinational companies alike. One of the key factors driving consumer confidence in emerging markets is the increasing focus on infrastructure development. Governments in many of these countries are investing heavily in building modern transportation networks, expanding access to electricity, and improving telecommunications. These infrastructure improvements not only support economic growth but also enhance living standards for citizens, further boosting consumer spending.  Furthermore, as education levels rise in emerging markets, consumers have become more discerning and demanding. They are seeking higher-quality products and services that align with their aspirations for a better lifestyle. This shift towards premium brands presents a lucrative opportunity for companies that can offer superior goods and experiences.  In addition to economic factors, social and cultural changes are also impacting consumer behavior. As societies become more urbanized and globalized, there is a greater exposure to new ideas and lifestyles through media platforms like television, movies, and social media. This has led to an increased desire for Western-style products, such as fashion trends or tech gadgets.  However, it's important to note that consumer preferences can vary significantly across different emerging markets due to local traditions and values. Companies must invest time and resources into market research to identify these nuances so they can tailor their offerings accordingly.  Another noteworthy aspect of the strengthening consumer confidence in emerging markets is the growing focus on sustainability. Environmental awareness has gained traction among consumers worldwide, including those in developing economies. Many consumers now prefer eco-friendly products or those from companies with sustainable business practices.  The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly impacted consumer behavior globally; however, its effects have been particularly pronounced in emerging markets due to vulnerabilities within healthcare systems and economies. Nonetheless,rising vaccination rates combined with government stimulus measures have helped restore confidence among consumers.  Looking ahead,sustaining this upward trend will depend on various factors.Post-pandemic recovery efforts need to prioritize job creation,stabilizing inflation,and ensuring income growth.Digitalization will continue shaping consumption patterns,given the accelerated adoption during lockdowns.Another crucial determinant will be the ability of governments to support entrepreneurship and foster innovation, which can spur economic growth and boost consumer confidence.  In conclusion, the rebalancing of consumer growth towards emerging markets is a significant megatrend that presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses. The strengthening consumer confidence in these markets reflects various economic, social, and cultural factors. As consumers gain higher disposable incomes, improved access to credit, and increased exposure to global trends, their purchasing power continues to grow. For companies looking to tap into this market potential, a deep understanding of local preferences coupled with tailored strategies will be key to success. While obstacles such as political instability or cultural differences exist, businesses that can navigate these challenges stand poised for substantial rewards in these dynamic and evolving markets.",continue
"underwhelming, with many banks choosing not to take advantage of the cheap loans. This lack of demand has cast doubts over the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy in stimulating economic growth and combating deflation in the Eurozone.  However, the announcement of quantitative easing (QE) by the ECB has injected a renewed sense of optimism into the Eurozone economy. QE involves purchasing government bonds from member countries, injecting liquidity into financial markets, and lowering borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The aim is to encourage lending and investment, which will in turn boost economic activity.  There are several reasons why quantitative easing is expected to improve prospects for the Eurozone. Firstly, it will provide much-needed stimulus to an economy that has been struggling with low inflation and weak growth. By increasing liquidity in financial markets, QE will make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money. This is likely to lead to increased spending on goods and services, which will stimulate economic activity.  Secondly, quantitative easing can help alleviate concerns about deflation in the Eurozone. With inflation rates persistently below target levels over recent years, there have been fears that Europe could fall into a deflationary spiral - where falling prices reduce consumer spending further, leading to even lower prices. By injecting liquidity into financial markets through bond purchases, QE can help boost demand and raise inflation rates towards more desirable levels.  Thirdly, quantitative easing is expected to improve confidence in the European economy both domestically and internationally. Confidence plays a crucial role in driving economic activity as businesses are more willing to invest and consumers are more likely to spend when they have faith in future prospects. The announcement of QE by central banks often sends positive signals about their commitment towards supporting economic growth.  Moreover , while there may be concerns about potential negative consequences such as asset bubbles or moral hazard , these risks can be mitigated if policymakers carefully manage their exit strategies once conditions improve . In fact , one should not forget that the ECB only initiated its unconventional monetary policy measures after cutting interest rates to the zero lower bound and implementing negative deposit rates . Thus , QE is seen as an additional tool to be used alongside conventional monetary policy rather than a stand-alone measure .  Already, there are some early signs that quantitative easing is having a positive impact on the Eurozone. Stock markets have rallied, and bond yields have fallen. This suggests that investors are more confident in the outlook for Europe and are willing to invest in riskier assets.  Additionally, some countries within the Eurozone are already benefiting from lower borrowing costs due to quantitative easing. For instance, Spain has seen its borrowing costs fall significantly since the announcement of QE. This has reduced pressure on government finances and allowed for increased spending on public infrastructure projects.  Overall, while it may be too early to fully assess the impact of quantitative easing on the Eurozone economy, there are reasons to be optimistic about its prospects. By providing stimulus and boosting confidence, QE has the potential to invigorate economic growth and alleviate deflationary pressures in Europe. However, it will be important for policymakers to carefully manage their exit strategies and monitor potential risks associated with prolonged monetary accommodation. Only time will tell whether quantitative easing proves successful in improving prospects for the Eurozone.",continue
"will exceed growth expectations? In terms of which parts of the world are expected to exceed growth expectations, there are a few key regions that should be highlighted.  First and foremost, the United States is likely to lead the pack when it comes to surpassing growth expectations. The US economy has shown remarkable resilience and recovery in recent years. With a combination of strong consumer spending, robust job creation, and continued business investment, the US is expected to maintain its momentum in 2022. The successful rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and significant fiscal stimulus packages have provided a solid foundation for economic growth. Additionally, President Joe Biden's ambitious infrastructure plans are poised to further stimulate economic activity and create new employment opportunities.  Another region that holds great potential for surpassing growth expectations is Asia, particularly countries like China and India. China's swift containment of the pandemic coupled with aggressive fiscal policies has put it on track for rapid recovery. The country's strong manufacturing sector and growing middle class continue to drive domestic consumption and fuel export-driven growth. Similarly, India has been gradually bouncing back from the impact of Covid-19 as businesses reopen and consumer demand picks up pace.  Furthermore, some European economies such as Germany are also anticipated to outperform previous projections. Europe as a whole faced significant challenges due to lockdown measures and trade disruptions during the pandemic; however, governments have implemented effective vaccination campaigns while implementing support measures for businesses impacted by restrictions. As these economies gradually reopen and adapt to post-pandemic conditions, they are likely to experience an uptick in consumer spending accompanied by increased business investment.  It is important not only to focus on specific regions but also specific sectors that are set for rapid expansion in a post-pandemic world. One such sector is technology-driven industries including e-commerce platforms, digital services providers, telecommunication companies - entities catering towards remote work culture which has become more prevalent during ongoing travel restrictions across nations.  Moreover various renewable energy sectors like solar power generation or electric vehicles (EVs) manufacturing are likely to thrive, as governments worldwide prioritize sustainable practices and shift toward green infrastructure. These sectors offer significant growth opportunities as they align with global efforts to combat climate change while creating new jobs and innovation.  However, it is important to note that these predictions are subject to various factors such as ongoing geopolitical tensions, potential future waves of the pandemic, and unforeseen economic shocks. While there is optimism for exceeding growth expectations in certain regions and sectors, vigilance must be maintained to address potential risks and challenges that may arise.  In summary, while the global economy is undoubtedly in recovery mode, there are specific regions like the United States, Asia (especially China and India), and select European countries that are expected to exceed growth expectations. Additionally, sectors such as technology-driven industries and renewable energy hold immense potential for rapid expansion in a post-pandemic scenario. However, uncertainties persist which require proactive measures from governments, businesses, and individuals alike to ensure a sustained recovery path.",continue
"It reminded me of the immense dedication and talent required to succeed in the world of classical music.""  Among the impressive lineup of young artists was Norwegian violinist, Emma Jensen. A rising star in her field, Jensen's performance left a lasting impression on the judges and audience members alike. Her technical prowess combined with emotional depth set her apart from the other participants.  Born into a musical family, Jensen's love for the violin blossomed at an early age. Her father, Lars Jensen, himself a renowned cellist, recognized his daughter's extraordinary talent from the moment she first picked up a bow. Determined to nurture her potential, he became Emma's primary source of inspiration and guidance.  As she grew older, it became clear that Emma had inherited not only her father's passion but also his remarkable skill. Lars Jensen made it his mission to expose his daughter to various musical influences and opportunities that would cultivate her unique talents.  When they learned about the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award, Lars immediately knew that this was an opportunity too valuable to pass up. He encouraged Emma to apply and supported her throughout every step of the rigorous selection process.  Traveling together to Vienna for the award ceremony felt like a significant milestone in their journey as musician and mentor. They both understood that this event could mark a turning point in Emma's burgeoning career.  Throughout two days of intense competition filled with exceptional performances from talented young musicians around Europe, both Lars and Manuel Rybach closely observed each candidate's abilities and potential.  As they listened attentively during discussions amongst jury members before announcing their decision, anticipation weighed heavy in their hearts. The realization that winning this award could open doors for Emma added extra pressure onto their already nervous states.  Finally came the moment when Manuel Rybach stood proudly on stage holding an envelope containing their verdict: ""The winner of the 2012 Credit Suisse Young Artist Award is...Emma Jensen!""  Both father and daughter shared tears of joy and relief. The immense honor and recognition that accompanied the prize were surpassed only by the sense of pride welling up inside Lars Jensen's heart.  Emma's victory solidified her position as a promising violinist on the brink of a remarkable career. The financial reward enabled her to pursue further studies with renowned instructors, expand her repertoire, and participate in prestigious music festivals worldwide.  But beyond the material benefits, Lars knew that this achievement represented something more profound - affirmation of Emma's unwavering commitment to her art. It validated all those years he spent nurturing her talent and encouraging her to reach for unreachable heights.  Looking back at that pivotal moment during the award ceremony, both Emma and Lars recognize it as a transformational experience that shaped their lives forever. It not only propelled Emma towards international recognition but also deepened their bond as father and daughter.  With each subsequent success in Emma's career, whether it be performing at illustrious concert halls or collaborating with esteemed musicians globally, Lars remains by his daughter's side – guiding, supporting, and believing in her unequivocally.  As they reflect upon their journey together, they are grateful for organizations like Credit Suisse Foundation who recognize and support emerging talent. Without such opportunities or individuals like Manuel Rybach taking notice of these young artists' passion and dedication, many extraordinary musicians may go unnoticed or unrealized in their full potential.

"and EU membership have a significant impact on the Swiss economy and the future of our nation.  One of the most pressing issues we face is immigration. Switzerland has long relied on a steady influx of foreign workers to fill gaps in our labor market. Immigrants bring much-needed skills, expertise, and diversity to our country. They contribute to our economic growth and innovation, playing a vital role in several industries such as healthcare, hospitality, and technology.  However, recent anti-immigration sentiments have been gaining momentum within certain factions of society. These sentiments are fueled by fears that immigrants could displace Swiss workers or strain public resources. While it is important to address these concerns, it is equally vital for us to acknowledge the benefits that immigration brings.  The Confederation of Swiss Employers recognizes that we depend on immigration for our continued economic success. With an aging population and low birth rate, Switzerland needs a constant stream of skilled workers to maintain its thriving industries and support social programs such as retirement provision.  Maintaining the free movement of persons with EU countries is crucial for us. It allows Swiss businesses access to a broader talent pool within Europe and enables easier trade relationships with neighboring nations. Any restrictions or barriers imposed on this freedom would hamper economic growth and diminish Switzerland's competitiveness on the global stage.  Besides immigration, unnecessary regulations pose another threat to our labor market's flexibility and efficiency. Overly burdensome regulations hinder entrepreneurship and job creation by discouraging investment in new ventures or expansion projects.  Switzerland's status as the most competitive country globally did not come about by chance; it stems from policies that promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and free-market principles while safeguarding worker rights. We must remain vigilant against excessive regulation that could stifle these conditions which attract both domestic enterprises as well as foreign investors who create jobs here at home.  Another critical issue affecting voters' decisions is wages - specifically whether there should be a minimum wage implemented in Switzerland. While some argue that a minimum wage guarantees fair compensation and protects workers from exploitation, it is essential to consider the potential consequences on employment and economic growth.  Switzerland's unique labor market model is characterized by high wages and strong social benefits negotiated between employers' associations and trade unions. It has proven successful in maintaining a healthy balance between worker rights and business competitiveness. Introducing a rigid minimum wage might disrupt this delicate equilibrium, leading to unintended consequences such as job losses or reduced hiring.  The question of EU membership also looms large in our national conversation. The outcome of any potential referendums on this issue will have profound implications for Switzerland's economy. While being outside the EU allows us greater independence in decision-making, it also means we must navigate complex trade agreements with the bloc.  EU membership provides access to an enormous market with over 400 million consumers, making it easier for Swiss businesses to export their goods and services abroad. However, joining the EU would require us to adhere to its regulations without having a say in shaping them.  Ultimately, voters play a crucial role in shaping Switzerland's future through their decisions on these critical issues. It is essential that we base our choices on factual information, taking into account both short-term concerns and long-term implications for our economy.  As Valentin Vogt rightly states: ""Voters have a good sense of things."" Let us trust that Swiss voters will make informed decisions that allow our nation to continue prospering while ensuring fairness and opportunity for all citizens",continue
"his team argue that the idea of currency wars is largely a media exaggeration.  According to Credit Suisse, the term ""currency war"" implies an intentional and coordinated effort by central banks to devalue their currencies in order to gain a competitive advantage in international trade. However, the report suggests that central banks are primarily focused on domestic economic conditions rather than engaging in deliberate currency manipulation.  The ultra-loose monetary policies implemented by the United States, Japan, and Britain were primarily a response to weak domestic demand and concerns about deflation. These measures aimed to stimulate economic growth and boost inflation rather than intentionally devaluing their currencies. As Credit Suisse points out, if these countries were truly engaged in a currency war, they would have taken more aggressive actions such as direct intervention in foreign exchange markets or imposing capital controls.  Furthermore, the report highlights that central banks have different policy objectives which may lead to divergent monetary policies and subsequent currency movements. The US Federal Reserve's main priority is employment growth and stable prices while the Bank of Japan has been striving for higher inflation levels after years of deflationary pressures. Each country's unique economic circumstances drive their respective monetary policy decisions rather than an explicit intention to manipulate exchange rates.  While it is true that emerging market economies have faced challenges due to stronger currencies resulting from loose monetary policies in major economies, Credit Suisse argues that blaming this solely on deliberate manipulation overlooks larger structural issues within these emerging economies themselves. Countries with stronger currencies often struggle with exports competitiveness due to factors such as high labor costs or infrastructure constraints.  Instead of actively waging a currency war against each other, major economies are more likely engaged in ""competitive easing"". This refers to individual efforts by central banks seeking internal goals but unintentionally impacting exchange rates indirectly. Global capital flows respond differently between countries depending on their specific needs for safe assets or higher returns. As investors search for yield opportunities worldwide they flow towards different financial markets, impacting currency valuations along the way.  Credit Suisse's report suggests that instead of focusing on a supposed currency war, policymakers should address structural issues within their economies. Advancing structural reforms, improving productivity, and investing in education and infrastructure are more crucial for long-term competitiveness rather than relying solely on exchange rate fluctuations.  Furthermore, the report calls for enhanced international policy coordination to manage potential spillover effects from monetary policies. Policies such as quantitative easing can lead to unintended consequences globally; therefore, communication and cooperation between central banks are vital to prevent destabilizing market reactions.  In conclusion, Credit Suisse argues that the notion of a currency war is inflated by media sensationalism. Central banks' policies primarily aim at addressing domestic economic challenges rather than intentionally manipulating exchange rates. While there are implications for emerging market economies due to stronger currencies resulting from loose monetary policies in major economies, these challenges stem from larger structural issues within these countries themselves. Addressing these underlying vulnerabilities and enhancing international policy coordination will be key moving forward rather than fixating on a hypothetical ""currency war"".",continue
"it is unlikely to happen in the near future due to political considerations.  Euro bonds, or commonly known as common euro zone bonds, are debt instruments that would be issued jointly by the member countries of the eurozone. These bonds would allow countries with higher borrowing costs, such as Greece or Italy, to benefit from lower interest rates on their debt by pooling their risk with other member states. From a theoretical standpoint, this makes a lot of sense.  Firstly, euro bonds would create a more stable and integrated financial system within the eurozone. Currently, each country issues its own sovereign debt, which means that financial crises in one country can quickly spill over and affect neighboring economies. By pooling risks and resources through common bond issuance, it would provide stability by ensuring that any economic shocks are shared among all member states rather than concentrated on individual countries.  Secondly, euro bonds could lead to lower borrowing costs for struggling member states. Countries like Greece have been burdened with high interest rates due to market perceptions of their credit risk. By issuing joint bonds backed by stronger economies like Germany or France, these weaker economies could benefit from lower interest rates and reduce their debt servicing costs. This would enable them to allocate more funds towards economic growth initiatives instead of using a significant portion of their budgets for debt payments.  Additionally, euro bonds could contribute to greater fiscal discipline among member states. When countries issue their own sovereign debt backed solely by themselves, there is little external pressure on them to maintain sustainable fiscal policies. However, if they were dependent on joint issuance with other nations who have stricter fiscal standards (such as Germany), there would be greater incentives for adherence to responsible budgeting practices.  Despite these theoretical advantages of Eurobonds; however; political challenges make it difficult for them to become a reality at this point in time.  One major obstacle is the concern among creditor nations about assuming additional risks associated with weaker economies' debts. Countries like Germany fear that they would be held liable for the debts of countries that have a history of lax fiscal policies or economic mismanagement. This creates a moral hazard issue as it decreases incentives for countries to reform and imposes an undue burden on fiscally responsible nations.  Another hurdle is the lack of political consensus within the eurozone. Each member state has its own set of economic priorities and policy preferences, making it challenging to reach an agreement that satisfies all parties involved. Countries with stronger economies may not see the immediate benefits of euro bonds and are therefore reluctant to take on additional risks.  Furthermore, there are legal barriers that make euro bond issuance complicated. The creation of common debt instruments requires changes to existing treaties and legal frameworks, which can be a lengthy and complex process.  In light of these challenges, alternative solutions have been proposed. One possibility is the creation of a European financial stabilization fund that would issue bonds backed by member states' contributions without joint liability. This approach could provide some benefits without requiring significant changes to existing structures or constituting a full commitment to common bond issuance.  In conclusion, while euro bonds may make theoretical sense in terms of stabilizing the financial system, reducing borrowing costs for struggling economies, and promoting fiscal discipline within the Eurozone; political considerations currently hinder their implementation. Creditor nations' concerns about assuming additional risks from weaker economies' debts, divergent economic priorities within the Eurozone countries themselves, and legal complexities surrounding joint debt issuance all contribute to this obstacle. It remains uncertain when or if such an arrangement will become politically viable in the future as policymakers continue to grapple with finding solutions that strike a balance between collective responsibility and national interests.

These elements have allowed Swiss companies to thrive and maintain their status as global leaders across various industries.",continue
"have some impact on the Swiss real estate market in 2013. This measure, known as the ""Switzerland Federal Council's Self-Regulation"", was introduced in October 2012 to curb potential risks in the housing market. According to this regulation, prospective buyers must now provide a minimum of 20% equity when purchasing a property, up from the previous requirement of 10%.  This increase in equity requirements is likely to have an effect on both demand and supply in the real estate market. On one hand, it may deter some potential buyers who may not have sufficient funds to meet the higher equity threshold. This could lead to a slight decrease in demand for residential properties, especially among first-time buyers or those with limited financial resources.  On the other hand, this measure could also dampen investment activity by institutional investors and speculators who previously relied heavily on leverage when purchasing properties. With higher equity requirements, these investors may find it more difficult or less attractive to enter or expand their positions in the market. This could result in a decrease in speculative buying and potentially contribute to stabilizing property prices.  Furthermore, there are concerns that increasing interest rates globally could impact mortgage affordability for homeowners. While mortgage rates are currently low and expected to remain so for another year as mentioned earlier, any sudden increase can significantly affect individuals' ability to service their loans. If interest rates rise sharply or unexpectedly during 2013 without corresponding wage increases or improvements in income levels, it could put pressure on homeowners' finances and potentially cause distressed sales or foreclosures.  Additionally, external factors such as economic uncertainty at both national and global levels can also impact the Swiss real estate market. The ongoing Eurozone crisis and its effects on Switzerland's economic stability cannot be ignored. A worsening of this crisis or any other major geopolitical event can create turmoil within financial markets that might spill over into real estate.  Moreover, there is always a possibility of oversupply if property developers and construction companies continue to aggressively build new housing units without considering market demand. While the current supply-demand dynamics seem relatively balanced, any significant increase in unsold inventory could put downward pressure on prices.  In conclusion, while the Swiss real estate market appears robust with strong demand driven by low mortgage interest rates and stable salary trends, several factors could potentially curb its growth in 2013. The self-regulatory measures requiring higher levels of equity for home buyers, potential interest rate hikes, economic uncertainties both domestically and globally, and the risk of oversupply are among the key factors to watch. It is essential for market participants to carefully monitor these developments in order to navigate any potential challenges or opportunities that may arise this year. The impact of the self-regulatory measures on the Swiss real estate market in 2013 is still uncertain. While it may deter some potential buyers and dampen speculative buying, it could also contribute to a more stable market and prevent a housing bubble from forming. The increase in equity requirements aims to reduce the risk of borrowers defaulting on their mortgages if property values decline or interest rates rise significantly.  However, there are concerns that this measure may have unintended consequences. Some argue that higher equity requirements could result in a slowdown in construction activity as developers struggle to find buyers who can meet the new criteria. This could potentially lead to job losses within the construction sector and have wider implications for the Swiss economy.  Another factor that could curb the Swiss real estate market in 2013 is a potential slowdown in net immigration. While net immigration is estimated to be slightly below the figure for 2012, any significant decrease could impact demand for residential properties, especially in areas with high immigrant populations such as Zurich and Geneva.  Additionally, changes in government policies or regulations relating to foreign ownership of real estate may also have an impact on the market. The Swiss government has been tightening regulations on foreign property ownership over recent years due to concerns about rising housing prices and affordability issues for locals. Any further restrictions or changes to these policies could lead to a decrease in demand from foreign investors and potentially affect property prices.  Furthermore, global economic conditions play an important role in shaping Switzerland's real estate market. If there is a downturn or recession at a global level, it will likely have ripple effects on Switzerland's economy as well as its housing market. A decrease in consumer confidence or economic instability can result in reduced demand for residential properties and slower price growth.  It is worth noting that while there are potential factors that could curb growth, Switzerland's strong economy and stable political climate provide some level of resilience for its real estate market compared to other countries experiencing economic uncertainties.  In conclusion, while the demand for residential property in Switzerland remains strong, there are several factors that could potentially curb the growth of the market in 2013. The self-regulatory measures requiring higher levels of equity, potential interest rate hikes, economic uncertainties both domestically and globally, changes in immigration patterns and foreign ownership regulations are all important elements to consider. Monitoring these factors will be crucial for market participants to make informed decisions and navigate any challenges or opportunities that may arise throughout the year.",continue

"aging index, which measures the number of years a person can expect to live in good health, has been steadily increasing. This means that people are not only living longer but also enjoying better physical and mental wellbeing during their later years.  While this is undoubtedly great news for individuals and society as a whole, it also poses several challenges when it comes to financing pensions. The traditional model of pension systems relies on a steady flow of contributions from current workers to fund the retirement benefits of current retirees. However, with increasing life expectancy and a shrinking workforce in many countries, this model is becoming unsustainable.  The key question arises: Who will pay for my pension? As the burden of supporting an aging population grows, governments, employers, and individuals must come together to find innovative solutions that ensure everyone's retirement needs are met.  One possible solution is raising the retirement age. By extending the working lives of individuals, pension systems can alleviate some of the financial strain caused by longer life expectancies. However, this approach has its limitations. While many older adults are healthy and willing to work past traditional retirement ages, others may face physical or mental challenges that make continued employment difficult or impossible.  Another alternative is encouraging private savings and investment in addition to government-backed pension programs. Individuals could be incentivized to contribute more towards their own retirement through tax breaks or other financial incentives. This would help reduce reliance on government-funded pensions and provide individuals with greater control over their financial futures.  Additionally, governments and employers could explore options such as mandatory employer-sponsored savings plans or automatic enrollment in private pension schemes alongside traditional public pension programs. These initiatives would ensure that all workers have access to a basic level of retirement income while allowing them the flexibility to supplement it through personal savings.  Furthermore، fostering technological advancements and automation could potentially address some concerns about labor shortages caused by an aging population while simultaneously boosting productivity levels. By investing in industries such as robotics or artificial intelligence (AI), societies could create new job opportunities for younger generations while simultaneously reducing the need for physical labor among older workers.  However, these solutions are not without their challenges. Striking a balance between individual responsibility and social safety nets is crucial to prevent inequalities among retirees who may have had different opportunities for saving and investing throughout their working lives. Governments must ensure that any reforms consider the needs of vulnerable populations who may not have the means or capacity to save significant amounts for retirement.  In conclusion, addressing the question of who will pay for pensions requires a multi-faceted approach involving individuals, employers, and governments. By considering innovative strategies such as raising retirement ages, promoting private savings, fostering technological advancements, and ensuring social safety nets are inclusive and adequate, we can navigate the challenges posed by an aging population. It is essential that we act now to develop sustainable pension systems that guarantee financial security for current and future retirees in an era of increasing longevity. Only through collaboration and forward-thinking can we ensure a dignified retirement for all individuals in our society",continue

"and Greater Geneva. The increase in population, combined with an economic boom and a thriving tourism industry, has put immense strain on the Swiss road network. Congestion, accidents, and air pollution have become major concerns for both residents and policymakers.  To tackle this issue, several solutions can be explored. One potential solution is to invest heavily in public transportation infrastructure. Enhancing the capacity and accessibility of trains, trams, buses, and other forms of public transport would encourage people to rely less on private vehicles. This can be done by expanding existing railway lines and building new ones to connect remote areas to major cities. Additionally, creating efficient intermodal hubs where different modes of transportation intersect could further motivate people to switch from cars to public transport.  Another approach is the promotion of carpooling and ridesharing services. Encouraging commuters to share their rides through online platforms or organized carpooling programs can help reduce the number of vehicles on the roads during peak hours. This not only alleviates traffic congestion but also reduces carbon emissions.  Furthermore, implementing smart traffic management systems powered by advanced technologies could greatly improve traffic flow efficiency. Intelligent transportation systems can monitor real-time traffic conditions using sensors and data analysis algorithms to dynamically optimize signal timings at intersections or suggest alternative routes for drivers based on current congestion levels.  To discourage unnecessary car usage within cities' limits, imposing congestion charges during peak hours might prove effective in reducing traffic volume. By charging vehicles entering specific zones at certain times of the day or week, people may opt for alternative means of transport or choose off-peak hours for travel.  Additionally, incentivizing electric vehicle (EV) adoption through financial incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies can help accelerate the transition towards a greener future while simultaneously alleviating pressure on the road network caused by gasoline-powered vehicles.  Alongside these measures aimed at reducing private vehicle usage within cities lies the need to enhance connectivity between urban centers through enhanced cross-border connections. Coordinated efforts with neighboring countries, such as France, Germany, and Italy, could lead to the development of efficient high-speed rail networks that foster seamless travel across borders. By providing attractive alternatives to traveling by car or plane, these high-speed rail connections can help reduce congestion on the road network while promoting sustainable and efficient transportation.  However, it is evident that a comprehensive solution requires not only infrastructure improvements but also societal changes. Promoting a shift in mindset towards more sustainable modes of transportation can be achieved by raising awareness through education campaigns on the benefits of public transport usage and reducing car dependency.  In conclusion, addressing Switzerland's overburdened road network necessitates a multi-faceted approach involving investments in public transport infrastructure, promoting ridesharing and carpooling services, implementing smart traffic management systems utilizing cutting-edge technologies, imposing congestion charges during peak hours to discourage unnecessary car usage within cities' limits while incentivizing electric vehicle adoption. Additionally, cross-border connectivity enhancements along with educational campaigns to promote sustainable transportation choices are crucial components for a sustainable solution. Through this holistic approach encompassing various measures at infrastructure and societal levels Switzerland can alleviate its road network burden and pave the way for a more efficient and greener future.",continue
"also includes a desire to align their investments with their values and avoid supporting companies engaged in unethical practices.  Responsible investing, also known as sustainable or ethical investing, is a growing trend among investors. It involves considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. ESG factors include things like climate change policies, labor practices, board diversity, and community relations. By focusing on these aspects of a company's operations and impact on society, responsible investors aim to support businesses that demonstrate good corporate citizenship.  The notion that responsible investing might come at the expense of financial returns has been challenged in recent years. Various studies have shown that companies with strong ESG performance tend to outperform their peers in the long run. Credit Suisse's study sought to provide further insights into this area by examining whether avoiding so-called ""sin stocks"" (companies involved in activities like tobacco production or weapons manufacturing) had any effect on investment returns.  The study analyzed the performance of various equity portfolios over an 11-year period from 2007 to 2018. The portfolios were divided into two groups: one that excluded sin stocks based on market norms for responsible investing and another that included them for comparison purposes.  Interestingly enough, the results showed that excluding sin stocks did not result in inferior financial performance. In fact, the portfolio without sin stocks delivered slightly higher returns compared to its counterpart over the period studied. This finding indicates that responsible investing can potentially offer both financial gains and alignment with personal values.  Furthermore, it is worth noting that companies engaging in unethical practices often face legal risks and reputational damage that can adversely affect their long-term profitability. By avoiding these types of companies altogether or encouraging them to improve their behavior through active ownership strategies (such as voting at shareholder meetings), responsible investors can indirectly contribute to better business practices overall.  To further illustrate this point, some studies have highlighted how businesses focused on sustainability may be more resilient in times of crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, companies with strong ESG practices were often better equipped to handle the disruption and adapt to new market conditions. This suggests that responsible investing can also provide some level of risk mitigation and resilience during uncertain times.  Despite the increasing popularity of responsible investing, challenges remain. One challenge is defining what exactly constitutes a sin stock or an ""unacceptable"" corporate behavior. Different investors may have different thresholds for what they consider unethical or unsustainable.  Another challenge is measuring ESG factors accurately and consistently across different companies and industries. Without standardized reporting frameworks, it can be difficult for investors to compare potential investments based on their ESG performance accurately.  To address these challenges, various organizations are working on developing industry standards and frameworks for assessing sustainability risks and opportunities. The United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative is one such example that encourages signatories (institutional investors) to incorporate six principles focused on responsible investing into their investment processes.  In conclusion, responsible investing does not necessarily mean sacrificing financial returns; in fact, it can potentially enhance them over time while aligning investments with personal values. As awareness of corporate behavior continues to grow among investors, it becomes clear that being ""bad"" does not pay off in the long run both financially and ethically.  By actively engaging with companies through voting rights or divesting from those engaged in unethical practices altogether, responsible investors play a crucial role in creating positive change within businesses worldwide. As more evidence points towards the benefits of responsible investing beyond just financial gains, this approach has become more than just a trend - it's a way forward towards a more sustainable future for everyone involved.",continue
"conditions in Switzerland as positive . However , despite this positive outlook , uncertainty still inhibits investment for many Swiss SMEs .  The study reveals that uncertainty surrounding economic and political factors is the main reason why Swiss SMEs are hesitant to invest. This uncertainty stems from various sources, including global economic instability, trade disputes, and political tensions both domestically and internationally. Many SMEs are wary of making long-term commitments when there is so much volatility and unpredictability in the market.  One key aspect of uncertainty affecting investment decisions is the impact of trade disputes on Swiss SMEs. The ongoing trade conflict between major economies such as the United States and China has created a ripple effect felt worldwide. As a small open economy heavily dependent on exports, Switzerland has not been immune to this impact. Many Swiss SMEs rely on international markets for their products and services, making them particularly vulnerable to disruptions in global trade.  Political uncertainties also play a significant role in inhibiting investment for Swiss SMEs. In recent years, Switzerland has faced several critical political events such as Brexit and discussions about its relationship with the European Union (EU). These events have raised concerns among Swiss SMEs about accessing EU markets, regulatory changes, and potential barriers to cross-border trade.  Furthermore, domestic policy uncertainties also contribute to hesitation among Swiss SMEs when it comes to investing. Changes in tax regulations or labor laws can have a substantial impact on business operations and profitability. This lack of stability makes it difficult for small businesses to plan for the future with confidence.  Another factor highlighted by the study is access to financing options that meet the specific needs of small businesses. Although Switzerland boasts a well-developed financial sector, many entrepreneurs find it challenging to secure affordable capital for their ventures. The stringent lending criteria imposed by banks make it difficult for startups or smaller firms without extensive collateral or track records to obtain funding.  To overcome these challenges associated with uncertainty inhibiting investments by Swiss SMEs , Credit Suisse economists recommend several measures. Firstly, they emphasize the importance of stable and predictable political and economic environments. Government policies should aim to reduce uncertainty and ensure a favorable business climate for SMEs.  Secondly, there is a need for targeted support programs that address the specific financing needs of small businesses. This could include initiatives to facilitate access to capital, such as alternative financing options outside traditional banking channels or government-backed loan programs tailored for SMEs.  Furthermore, boosting innovation and digitalization efforts can also help Swiss SMEs become more agile in responding to uncertainties. Investing in new technologies and fostering an entrepreneurial spirit could enable companies to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.  The study concludes by stressing the significance of addressing uncertainty as a crucial factor in promoting investment by Swiss SMEs. By implementing strategies that reduce volatility and provide greater clarity regarding trade relations, regulatory frameworks, and financial access, Switzerland can enhance its appeal as an attractive environment for small business investment.  In conclusion , while Swiss SMEs generally view Switzerland as an advantageous location for business , uncertainty remains a significant deterrent when it comes to investment decisions . Addressing these uncertainties through stable political environments , targeted support programs , innovation initiatives , and enhanced financial accessibility will play a vital role in encouraging investments by Swiss SMEs . This will not only benefit individual businesses but also contribute positively to employment growth and overall economic development in Switzerland",continue
"or discarded at the retail and consumer level. It includes food that is spoiled, expired, or deemed unfit for consumption due to aesthetic reasons.  The environmental impact of food loss and waste goes far beyond just the economic implications. It also puts a significant strain on natural resources and exacerbates climate change. The production and distribution of food require land, water, energy, and other inputs that contribute to deforestation, water scarcity, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil degradation.  When food is lost or wasted, all these resources invested in its production are essentially wasted as well. For example, when crops are left to rot in fields or during post-harvest handling due to inadequate infrastructure or market access issues in developing countries, it not only means lost income for farmers but also an unnecessary depletion of land and water resources.  Moreover, the decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces a significant amount of methane gas – a potent greenhouse gas that contributes greatly to global warming. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), if food waste were a country's carbon footprint, it would rank third after China and the United States.  Reducing food loss in developing countries requires investment in improved storage facilities such as warehouses with temperature control systems to preserve perishable produce like fruits and vegetables. Additionally maintaining proper transportation infrastructure is crucial for reducing losses during transit from rural areas to markets where refrigerated trucks can help mitigate spoilage caused by extreme temperatures.  In developed countries where most consumer-level wastage occurs due to buying more than needed or improper storage at home redistributing excess edible foods through donations can be an effective solution. Moreover educating consumers about smart shopping habits such as planning meals ahead reducing impulse buying products approaching expiration dates properly storing leftovers could significantly reduce household wastage levels.  Efforts should also focus on improving supply chain efficiency across all stages - from farm-level practices like avoiding overplanting crops with low market demand -to better inventory management transportation networks enhanced coordination between food producers retailers and consumers to minimize waste.  Addressing food loss and waste is a multifaceted challenge that requires collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society. Governments can play a pivotal role in establishing policies that incentivize sustainable production practices and develop infrastructure to support efficient post-harvest management. Businesses can adopt circular economy approaches by implementing strategies like utilizing imperfect or surplus produce creatively or investing in research for new technologies that extend shelf life without compromising quality.  Additionally, raising awareness among consumers about the environmental impact of their food choices is crucial. Wasting less food not only conserves resources but also helps alleviate hunger and reduce pressure on natural ecosystems.  In conclusion, mitigating the environmental impact of food loss and waste should be a priority for both developed and developing nations. By implementing comprehensive strategies that address inefficiencies at every stage of the food system, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, preserve natural resources, and contribute to global efforts in combating climate change while ensuring sustainable access to nutritious food for all",continue
"from each other? This is where social networks come in.   Social networks have become powerful political tools because they provide a platform for individuals with similar grievances or interests to connect and mobilize. They allow people from different walks of life, with varying backgrounds and beliefs, to unite around a common cause. In the case of revolutionary uprisings, social networks have played a crucial role in fostering solidarity among diverse groups.  One of the key strengths of social networks is their ability to break down barriers of distance and geography. Traditional forms of organizing, like face-to-face meetings or physical protests, often require individuals to be physically present in the same location. This can be a challenge when dealing with large populations or when trying to coordinate efforts across vast regions. Social networks overcome these limitations by providing virtual spaces where people can communicate instantaneously regardless of their physical location.  Through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, activists are able to share information about protests, organize demonstrations, and spread awareness about injustices at an unprecedented speed. Messages can be disseminated instantly to thousands or even millions of users who are connected through these social networking sites. The ability to reach such wide audiences quickly and efficiently has revolutionized the way political movements operate.  Moreover, social networks have empowered previously marginalized voices by giving them a platform on which they can express their opinions freely without fear of retribution from oppressive regimes or powerful elites. Online spaces offer an opportunity for individuals who may not have access to traditional media outlets or formal channels for political participation to make their voices heard.  This inclusivity has been particularly crucial for youth populations who often feel disenfranchised by mainstream politics but find solace in the virtual communities that form on social networking sites. The youth unemployment crisis faced by many countries creates fertile ground for discontentment among young people seeking change and better opportunities for themselves and future generations.  While it is true that people within these social networks may hold differing views beyond the common cause, the power of social networks lies in their ability to create a sense of solidarity around a shared goal. Social activists understand that unity is strength, and by focusing on the common grievances they can mobilize large numbers of people towards political change.  However, it is important to recognize that social networks alone cannot bring about lasting political transformation. They can serve as catalysts for mobilization and organization but ultimately need to be coupled with concrete actions and strategies. For example, protests organized through social networks must translate into tangible demands and negotiations with those in power in order to achieve meaningful change.  In addition, governments have also recognized the power of social networks and have employed various strategies to control or manipulate these platforms for their own benefit. Some regimes have resorted to surveillance techniques or internet shutdowns during times of heightened political tension. However, such attempts are often met with fierce resistance from tech-savvy activists who find ways around censorship measures.  In conclusion, social networks have proven themselves as powerful political tools by facilitating connections among diverse groups and enabling rapid dissemination of information. They offer previously unheard voices a platform on which they can express themselves freely and mobilize for change. While challenges exist in bridging differences among individuals within these networks, the ability to unite around shared grievances has been instrumental in driving revolutionary upsurges across various regions worldwide. Nonetheless, it is crucial for activists to recognize that digital organizing must be coupled with offline actions if true political transformation is to be achieved",continue

"on four key areas: regulation, technology, globalization, and risk management.  Regulation is one of the most critical issues facing the financial industry after the crisis. Governments and international bodies such as the G20 have put in place stringent regulations to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial meltdown. These regulations aim to increase transparency, reduce systemic risk, and ensure that banks maintain adequate capital buffers. While these measures have made the financial system more resilient, they have also increased compliance costs for banks and constrained their ability to take on risky investments.  Technology is another key factor shaping the future of the financial industry. The rise of fintech has disrupted traditional banking models by offering innovative solutions such as peer-to-peer lending platforms, robo-advisors, and mobile payment systems. These technologies are making financial services more accessible and affordable for consumers while also increasing competition within the industry. Banks are adapting by investing heavily in digital transformation initiatives to stay relevant in this new landscape.  Globalization is undergoing a significant shift as emerging markets become increasingly important drivers of global economic growth. Countries like China and India are experiencing rapid urbanization and a growing middle class that demands access to higher-quality financial services. This presents both opportunities and challenges for global banks that need to navigate local regulations while tapping into these emerging markets' potential.  Risk management has become a top priority for banks in light of past failures. They now face stricter oversight from regulators who require them to improve their risk assessment frameworks, stress testing methodologies, and capital allocation practices. Additionally, banks are investing heavily in advanced analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to enhance their risk modeling capabilities further.  Looking ahead at these developments , it is clear that there will be winners and losers within the financial industry . Smaller regional banks may struggle with compliance costs associated with increased regulation , while larger institutions with economies of scale can better absorb these expenses . Fintech firms may challenge traditional banking models , but collaboration between the two sectors could also drive innovation and create new market opportunities . Banks that successfully navigate the globalization trend and tailor their offerings to emerging markets' needs are likely to gain a competitive edge .  The crisis has reshaped the financial industry in fundamental ways, leading to a more cautious regulatory environment, increased adoption of technology, changing patterns of globalization, and a focus on robust risk management. As the industry continues to evolve over the next decade, it will be essential for financial institutions to remain agile and adaptive. Partnering with fintech companies can provide access to cutting-edge technology while collaborating with global regulators can help ensure compliance with evolving regulations. By embracing these changes proactively, banks can position themselves for success in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic financial landscape. Another significant trend to watch in the post-crisis financial industry is the increasing focus on sustainability and responsible investing. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the need for better risk management practices and a more conscientious approach to investments. As a result, there has been a growing demand for investments that not only generate financial returns but also have positive social and environmental impacts.  Asset managers are now incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into their investment strategies. They are conducting thorough due diligence on companies' sustainability practices before making investment decisions, considering factors such as carbon emissions, labor rights, diversity, and corporate governance. This shift towards sustainable investing reflects changing consumer preferences as more individuals prioritize supporting companies that align with their values.  At the same time, blockchain technology is starting to revolutionize the way financial transactions are conducted. Blockchain's distributed ledger system enables secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries. It has the potential to streamline processes such as cross-border payments, trade finance, and supply chain management while reducing costs and fraud risks.  Central banks are also exploring digital currencies powered by blockchain technology. These central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could provide faster payment settlements while improving financial inclusion by reaching unbanked populations in remote areas.  Another aspect of the post-crisis financial landscape is cybersecurity. With increased digitization comes greater exposure to cyber threats. Financial institutions need robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive customer data from unauthorized access or breaches that can lead to severe reputational damage or massive losses.  Moreover, as economies become increasingly interconnected through globalization efforts like international trade agreements or collaborations on infrastructure projects like China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), managing geopolitical risks becomes crucial for financial institutions involved in cross-border activities.  Lastly, demographic shifts present both challenges and opportunities for the financial industry after the crisis. Aging populations put pressure on pension systems while creating opportunities for firms specializing in retirement planning products or senior-focused services.  On the other hand, the rise of millennials as a key consumer segment has led to greater demand for digital banking services and impact investing options. This demographic shift requires financial institutions to adapt their product offerings and communication strategies to cater to millennials' unique preferences.  In conclusion, the financial industry has experienced significant changes in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Increased regulation, technology advancements, changing patterns of globalization, enhanced risk management practices, sustainability aspirations, blockchain innovation, cybersecurity concerns, geopolitical risks, and demographic shifts are all shaping the future trajectory of this industry.  To thrive in this evolving landscape, financial institutions must embrace these trends proactively rather than resisting change. Banks need to strike a balance between compliance with regulations and innovation initiatives through strategic partnerships with fintech firms for collaboration opportunities.  By leveraging technology advancements such as AI algorithms or blockchain solutions while aligning themselves with sustainable investing principles and prioritizing risk management protocols against cyber threats or geopolitical events they can position themselves as leaders in an increasingly interconnected global financial system.  As markets continue to evolve amid economic uncertainties and emerging challenges like climate change or pandemics such as COVID-19 outbreak resilient financial institutions that seize these opportunities will not only survive but also excel in a new era of finance driven by sustainable growth models.",continue
"reserve requirements for banks , and injected liquidity into the financial system.  These measures, coupled with the country's strong domestic consumption and robust export sector, helped Brazil weather the storm of the global financial crisis. While other economies around the world experienced sharp contractions, Brazil managed to keep its economy afloat with minimal damage.  One key factor that contributed to Brazil's resilience was its relatively closed financial system. Unlike many developed nations heavily reliant on foreign capital flows, Brazil had imposed stricter regulations on international investments and maintained capital controls. This limited exposure to volatile global markets and shielded Brazil from much of the turmoil experienced elsewhere.  Additionally, Brazil benefited from its large agricultural and commodity sectors. These industries remained largely unaffected by the global downturn as demand for food and raw materials remained relatively stable. The country's abundant natural resources allowed it to continue exporting commodities such as soybeans, iron ore, and oil at favorable prices even during uncertain times.  Furthermore, social programs implemented by former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva played a crucial role in supporting Brazilian households during the crisis. Programs such as Bolsa Família provided cash transfers to low-income families, helping them maintain their purchasing power even as unemployment rates rose. This direct injection of funds into the economy stimulated domestic demand and supported overall economic stability.  Another factor that contributed to Brazil's successful navigation through the financial crisis was its strong banking sector. State-owned banks played a significant role in providing credit to businesses and consumers when private-sector banks were hesitant due to heightened risk aversion. Their ability to maintain a steady pace of credit growth ensured that liquidity continued flowing through the economy despite external shocks.  However, it is important to acknowledge that not all sectors of the Brazilian economy emerged unscathed from the crisis. The manufacturing industry faced challenges due to decreased external demand for goods amid global recessionary pressures. Additionally, some local businesses struggled with high inflation rates driven by increased government spending during this period.  Nevertheless, Brazil's ability to withstand the financial crisis and continue growing is a testament to the resilience of its economy and the effectiveness of its counter-cyclical policies. The government's proactive measures, combined with favorable domestic conditions and careful economic management, allowed Brazil to bounce back relatively quickly compared to many other nations.  Looking ahead, Brazil continues to face ongoing challenges such as structural reforms, fiscal sustainability, and reducing income inequality. However, the lessons learned from successfully navigating past crises position Brazil well for future economic stability and growth. Building on its strong fundamentals and continuing to implement prudent policies will be crucial in ensuring that Brazil remains resilient in the face of future global shocks. Overall, Brazil's successful weathering of the financial crisis has instilled confidence in its economy and bolstered its reputation as a stable emerging market. This has attracted foreign investors seeking opportunities for growth and diversification.   In the years following the crisis, Brazil experienced a period of sustained economic expansion. The country's GDP grew at an average annual rate of around 4%, fueled by robust domestic consumption, increased investment, and strong exports. This economic growth helped lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty and contributed to a rising middle class.  Additionally, Brazil took advantage of the post-crisis period to address some structural weaknesses in its economy. Efforts were made to improve infrastructure, enhance competitiveness, and attract more foreign direct investment. The government implemented measures to streamline bureaucracy, reduce red tape for businesses, and promote innovation.  Moreover, Brazil recognized the importance of diversifying its export base beyond commodities in order to reduce vulnerability to external shocks. Investments were made in sectors such as technology, renewable energy, and services industries like tourism and entertainment. These initiatives aimed at fostering a more balanced economy that is less dependent on fluctuations in global commodity prices.  Furthermore, Brazil strengthened its role on the international stage during this period. It became increasingly active in multilateral organizations such as BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa), where it cooperated with other emerging economies to advocate for fairer global trade agreements and reforms within international financial institutions.  However effective Brazil's response was during the financial crisis; it still faces ongoing challenges that need attention moving forward. One key issue is long-term fiscal sustainability due to high public debt levels and growing pension obligations. Reforms are necessary to contain public spending while ensuring social programs remain intact.  Another critical challenge for Brazil involves reducing income inequality that persists within society despite progress made over recent years. Investing in education further narrowing gaps between rural areas versus urban centers will be essential objectives towards achieving this goal.  Moreover, Brazil must continue its efforts to combat corruption and improve governance practices. These issues have undermined confidence in the country's institutions and hindered investment. Taking strong measures to enhance transparency, strengthen the rule of law, and reform political processes will be imperative for Brazil to attract sustained foreign investment.  In conclusion, Brazil's ability to successfully weather the financial crisis was a result of solid domestic fundamentals, proactive fiscal and monetary policies, a diversified export base, social programs supporting vulnerable populations and a resilient banking sector. Building on these strengths while addressing ongoing challenges will be crucial for sustaining economic stability and promoting inclusive growth moving forward. By continuing prudent economic management and implementing necessary structural reforms, Brazil can position itself as a stronghold among emerging markets with the potential for long-term sustainable development.",continue
"to Earth, and gave the stolen fire to mankind. This act of defiance sparked a revolution in human civilization, enabling progress and innovation.  As humanity progressed, so did its hunger for energy. Fire was just the beginning; humans began to exploit their surroundings for various sources of power. Early civilizations harnessed the strength of wind through sails to navigate oceans and rivers. They built waterwheels to grind grain or pump water, utilizing the power of flowing rivers. It was during this era that ingenuity flourished as individuals sought inventive ways to fulfill their energy needs.  The discovery of coal marked a significant turning point in human history. With coal's immense energy potential, industries boomed and societies flourished during the Industrial Revolution. Factories sprang up like mushrooms across landscapes previously untouched by human expansion, fueled by black gold extracted from deep underground mines.  However, as progress marched forward unabatedly, so did humanity's impact on the environment. The alarming rate at which forests were felled for fuel raised concerns about deforestation and its devastating consequences on ecosystems worldwide. And thus emerged a need for alternative forms of energy; ones that could satiate mankind's ever-growing demands while being more sustainable.  Enterprising scientists turned their attention towards harnessing another gift from nature: sunlight. Solar power became an intriguing possibility with vast untapped potential lying beyond our atmosphere - an unending source capable of transforming lives without depleting precious resources or polluting our planet.  Advances in technology brought solar panels that could convert sunlight into usable electricity- opening up boundless possibilities for Earth's inhabitants who craved affordable clean energy. Governments started investing heavily in solar farms while corporations embraced sustainability practices by installing solar rooftops on their buildings.  Yet even as solar energy soared towards prominence, humans sought still more diverse options to satisfy their insatiable thirst for power and innovation continued unabatedly to bring forth revolutionary concepts like geothermal energy - tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface, wind farms - harnessing the power of relentless gusts on land and at sea, and hydroelectric power systems - converting energy from flowing water.  The exploration of nuclear power unfolded with both excitement and apprehension. The prospect of a virtually limitless source of energy fascinated minds around the globe; however, concerns about safety and waste management persisted as well.  Today, humanity finds itself at a crossroads. The climate crisis has reached a critical junction, prompting urgent calls for more sustainable energy solutions to combat global warming.

"in 1832, further deepening mistrust towards the banking sector.  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was a response to the need for stability and oversight in the financial system. It established a central bank that would act as a lender of last resort, provide liquidity to banks during times of crisis, and regulate the overall money supply. This gave birth to the Federal Reserve System, which consists of twelve regional banks spread across major cities in the US and overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.  The primary responsibilities of these ""watchmen"" are twofold: controlling inflation and maximizing employment. Through its monetary policy tools, such as setting interest rates or conducting open market operations, the Fed aims to maintain price stability while promoting sustainable economic growth. By adjusting interest rates upward or downward based on economic indicators, they attempt to strike a delicate balance between boosting employment levels without sparking excessive inflation.  One key aspect that makes the Federal Reserve unique is its independence from political influence. While it is indeed created by Congress and subject to some oversight from elected officials, it operates with significant autonomy when making monetary decisions. This insulation shields it from short-term political pressures and allows it to focus on long-term economic goals.  Another critical function performed by these watchmen is supervising financial institutions within their jurisdiction. The Fed monitors banks' activities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations designed to protect consumers' interests and maintain financial stability. By conducting regular examinations or stress tests on member banks, they work diligently towards averting potential crises or identifying weaknesses that might require corrective actions.  This regulatory role extends beyond traditional banking institutions too; after experiencing one of history's worst financial meltdowns in 2008—the subprime mortgage crisis—the Fed's mandate was broadened through Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform legislation passed by Congress in 2010. It empowered them with greater oversight over non-bank entities like hedge funds or insurance companies that could pose systemic risks to the economy.  In addition to their regulatory and monetary responsibilities, the Federal Reserve acts as a hub for economic research and analysis. Economists employed by the Fed routinely study various aspects of the economy, analyzing data, and publishing reports on trends or emerging risks. This research informs policymakers on appropriate courses of action while enhancing public understanding of economic dynamics.  However, being a powerful organization comes with immense scrutiny and criticism too. Critics argue that the Fed's policies disproportionately benefit Wall Street or wealthy elites at the expense of ordinary citizens. They question its independence, arguing that political considerations occasionally influence its decisions. Furthermore, others argue that excessive intervention in markets can distort market signals and lead to unintended consequences.  Despite these controversies surrounding its role in shaping national monetary policy, there is no denying that the Federal Reserve plays an essential role in maintaining stability within the US financial system. Its actions reverberate globally due to the US dollar's status as a reserve currency—a widely accepted medium for international trade—and as such hold significant sway over global economic conditions.  As we navigate an increasingly complex world driven by interconnected financial systems, having watchmen like those at the Federal Reserve becomes ever more crucial so that they may keep a vigilant eye on potential dangers lurking around corners while promoting steady growth for all stakeholders involved in this intricate dance called modern economics",continue

", making it a much more efficient and accurate monitoring system.  Natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods can cause immense damage to infrastructure and endanger human lives. These events are often sudden and unpredictable, making it difficult to take immediate action to prevent or mitigate their effects. However, with the advent of fiber optic monitoring technology, we now have a powerful tool at our disposal to enhance early warning systems and prevent these catastrophes from occurring.  Fiber optic cables used for communication purposes are made up of thin strands of glass or plastic that transmit light signals carrying information over long distances. However, when these cables are utilized for monitoring purposes, they become even more invaluable. By incorporating various sensors along the length of the cable, changes in temperature, strain levels, pressure variations, and vibrations can be detected with exceptional accuracy.  In the case of earthquakes, which are one of the most destructive natural disasters known to humanity, fiber optic monitoring plays a crucial role in providing real-time data on ground movements. By placing fiber optic cables underground or on structures susceptible to seismic activity such as bridges or dams, any subtle shifts in strain or movement can be detected instantly. This early warning system allows authorities to evacuate people from affected areas before any major damage occurs.  Similarly important is using fiber optic monitoring for landslide detection. Landslides can occur due to heavy rainfall or seismic activity and can result in devastating consequences for communities situated near steep slopes or unstable terrain. Fiber optic sensors placed strategically along hillsides can measure soil moisture content as well as detect any slight movements indicative of an impending landslide. This information enables local authorities to take preventive measures such as stabilizing slopes or evacuating residents before disaster strikes.  Flooding is another natural calamity that causes widespread destruction every year around the world. Fiber optic technology excels in flood prevention by continuously monitoring water levels in rivers and reservoirs with great precision. By identifying rising levels at an early stage, measures can be taken to reinforce riverbanks, divert water flow, or evacuate low-lying areas. These proactive steps significantly reduce the impact of flooding on infrastructure and save lives.  In addition to natural disasters, fiber optic monitoring finds applications in monitoring vital infrastructure such as gas pipelines and high-voltage electrical cables. Temperature variations or strain points along these systems can be detected promptly through the sensors embedded within the fiber optic cables. This enables timely maintenance and repair work to prevent leakages, explosions, or power outages that could have severe consequences for communities.  Investing in fiber optic monitoring technology is not only a prudent decision for preventing natural catastrophes but also a cost-effective one in the long run. The accurate detection capabilities of this technology minimize false alarms and unnecessary evacuations while maximizing response time when there is an actual threat. Furthermore, by allowing preventive measures to be taken before disasters occur, significant economic losses can be avoided.  In conclusion, fiber optic monitoring has revolutionized our ability to prevent natural catastrophes by providing real-time data on various environmental parameters. With its ability to detect changes in temperature fluctuations, strain levels, pressure variations, and vibrations with exceptional precision over long distances, this technology plays a crucial role in enhancing early warning systems for earthquakes, landslides, floods as well as ensuring the integrity of critical infrastructure systems.

In healthcare, mobile technology plays an essential role in bridging gaps between medical professionals and patients in rural areas. Through telemedicine initiatives such as ""M-Tiba,"" patients can consult doctors remotely via their phones without traveling long distances for check-ups or treatment. Mobile apps also provide women with crucial information about maternal health during pregnancy or childcare after delivery.  Moreover, education is another sector benefiting from this digital revolution. In many parts of Kenya, access to quality education is still limited. However, mobile phones have become powerful tools for learning, allowing students to access educational content and resources remotely. For instance, the eLimu app provides interactive lessons aligned with the national curriculum and has made learning more engaging and accessible for thousands of students.  The remarkable success of Kenya's mobile phone industry can be attributed to various factors. First and foremost is the government's commitment to creating an enabling environment for technological innovation.

Rio+20 emphasizes the need for more efficient farming methods that minimize wastage, promote biodiversity conservation, and ensure food security for all. Delegates are exploring ways to incentivize organic farming practices, invest in agricultural research, and support small-scale farmers who practice sustainable techniques.  Furthermore, waste management is also a pressing issue at Rio+20 discussions. Landfills overflowing with non-biodegradable waste pose significant threats not only to human health but also pollute oceans and harm wildlife habitats. The summit seeks innovative solutions such as recycling programs, waste-to-energy technologies, and increased public awareness about responsible consumption habits.  In addition to these specific areas of focus, Rio+20 encourages cross-sector collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations on a scale never seen before. The summit recognizes that addressing global challenges requires collective action from all stakeholders involved – from policymakers shaping regulations to businesses adopting environmentally friendly practices.  However ambitious these goals may be; implementation remains one of the biggest challenges facing Rio+20. The lack of enforcement mechanisms in previous agreements has hindered progress towards sustainability. Rio+20 delegates are keen to overcome this hurdle by devising strategies to monitor and evaluate the implementation of commitments made during the summit.

"therefore, investing in education should be a top priority. By providing accessible and high-quality education, we can equip our workforce with the necessary skills to adapt to a rapidly changing job market.  Additionally, fostering innovation and promoting entrepreneurship will contribute to economic growth and job creation. We should create an environment that encourages risk-taking and supports small businesses. This can be achieved by reducing bureaucratic red tape, offering tax incentives for startups, and providing mentorship programs for aspiring entrepreneurs.  Another crucial aspect of improving the standard of living is ensuring affordable access to healthcare services. We must work towards a system that provides high-quality healthcare while keeping costs under control. This could involve increasing efficiency in the healthcare sector through digitalization and streamlining administrative processes.  Furthermore, addressing income inequality should be at the forefront of our political agenda. It is unacceptable that a small segment of society enjoys disproportionate wealth while many struggle to make ends meet. Implementing progressive taxation measures can help redistribute wealth more equitably and ensure social justice.  However, it is important to note that these objectives cannot be achieved without fiscal responsibility. We must balance our social goals with sound economic policies that prevent excessive debt accumulation. The Pensions 2020 reform will require careful consideration of how to align benefits with available financial means without burdening future generations.  In order to navigate these challenges successfully, we need effective leadership and cooperation between different political parties. Engaging in constructive debates based on facts rather than ideological differences will enable us to find pragmatic solutions that benefit society as a whole.  Moreover, it is crucial for citizens themselves to actively participate in the political process by staying informed and voicing their concerns. Civil society has an important role in holding politicians accountable for their actions and advocating for policies that reflect the needs of the people.  Ultimately, achieving prosperity requires a comprehensive approach encompassing education, innovation, healthcare access, income equality, fiscal responsibility, leadership excellence ,and citizen engagement.The Worry Barometer should serve as a platform for open discussions and debates on these issues, enabling us to make informed decisions that shape our collective future.  In conclusion, the challenges ahead are significant, and it is through open dialogue and collaboration that we can find effective solutions. By aligning future benefits with available financial means, investing in education and innovation, ensuring accessible healthcare services, addressing income inequality, promoting fiscal responsibility ,and fostering strong leadership with active citizen participation, we can navigate the complexities of the political and economic landscape successfully. The Worry Barometer provides an important forum to address these concerns and work towards a more prosperous future for all. In order to tackle the social and political challenge of the Pensions 2020 reform, it is crucial to adopt measures that prioritize long-term sustainability. This requires finding a balance between providing adequate pensions for current retirees while also ensuring that future generations can rely on a stable social security system.  One approach could be gradually increasing the retirement age to reflect longer life expectancies and demographic shifts. By doing so, we can alleviate some of the financial strain on the pension system without unfairly burdening any specific age group. Additionally, encouraging individuals to save for their own retirement through private pension plans can help diversify funding sources and reduce reliance solely on government-funded schemes.  However, as we make adjustments to pension systems, it is important not to overlook vulnerable groups who may have limited opportunities for savings or face other challenges in securing their financial future. Measures such as means-tested benefits or targeted support programs can be implemented to ensure that those with lower income levels or individuals facing hardship are still adequately supported.  Furthermore, it is essential to build a strong economy that generates sufficient revenue and creates employment opportunities. This means promoting a business-friendly environment, attracting investments, and fostering innovation across industries. A thriving economy not only provides individuals with better job prospects but also contributes significantly towards generating tax revenues necessary for public welfare programs like pensions.  Alongside economic considerations, we must address the issue of demographic changes impacting pension systems. As populations age and birth rates decline in many countries, there will be fewer active workers contributing taxes compared to retirees receiving benefits. To counteract this effect, governments should explore initiatives aimed at encouraging higher birth rates or attracting skilled immigrants who could contribute positively both socially and economically.  In addition to these reforms specific to pensions and economics, politicians should actively engage with citizens in order to understand their concerns and aspirations better. Proper communication channels need to be established through regular town hall meetings or online platforms where citizens can voice their opinions and provide feedback on proposed policies.  Moreover, by encouraging transparency and accountability, politicians can rebuild trust with the public. This can be achieved by implementing measures to reduce corruption, ensuring fair and equitable distribution of resources, and providing comprehensive information about government decisions.  Lastly, the Worry Barometer should also consider environmental sustainability as a key component of long-term prosperity. As climate change poses significant threats to our economies and societies, it is essential to prioritize actions that mitigate environmental risks while promoting sustainable development practices. By investing in clean technologies and transitioning towards a low-carbon economy, we can safeguard future generations' well-being and economic stability.  In conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by the Pensions 2020 reform requires a multifaceted approach that combines economic reforms with social policies focused on education, healthcare accessibility, income equality measures along with fiscal responsibility. It requires collaboration between different political factions alongside active citizen participation to create sustainable solutions that benefit all members of society. The Worry Barometer serves as an essential tool for facilitating open dialogue and informed decision-making in order to shape a prosperous future for everyone.",continue

"They argue that the recent stabilization is merely a temporary fix to Argentina's underlying economic issues. The country has a history of boom and bust cycles, and it seems like they are once again heading towards another downturn.  One of the main concerns is Argentina's mounting debt burden. The government has been borrowing heavily in recent years to finance its spending, but with a weak economy and high inflation, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to service their debt. The sharp devaluation of the peso only exacerbates this problem as it increases the cost of servicing their foreign currency denominated debt.  Furthermore, Argentina's fiscal deficit remains stubbornly high. Despite implementing some austerity measures, such as cutting public spending and increasing taxes, the government has struggled to bring down its deficit to sustainable levels. This has led investors to question Argentina's ability to maintain fiscal discipline and reignite concerns about their long-term economic stability.  Another issue plaguing Argentina is its lackluster productivity growth. Years of protectionist policies have limited competition in many sectors of the economy, leading to inefficiencies and low productivity gains. This not only hampers economic growth but also makes it harder for Argentine firms to compete on a global scale.  In addition, political instability continues to be a major challenge for Argentina. The current administration under President Alberto Fernandez has faced criticism for its handling of the economy and pandemic response. There have been tensions within his coalition government, making it difficult for them to push through much-needed reforms that could address some of these structural weaknesses in the economy.  To make matters worse, external factors are also working against Argentina's recovery efforts. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted international trade and tourism – key sources of revenue for Argentine exports – further hampering economic recovery prospects.  Given these challenges, Credit Suisse analysts believe that without significant reforms aimed at addressing these structural issues facing Argentina's economy – including reducing red tape barriers for businesses, promoting competitiveness through market-oriented policies, and implementing sustainable fiscal measures – the country will continue to face an uphill battle towards sustainable economic growth.  Furthermore, Argentina's reliance on foreign financing to fund its economic recovery may become increasingly difficult as global investors become more risk-averse amid uncertainties in the global economy. With rising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions in the United States, it could become expensive for Argentina to attract foreign investment. This could exacerbate their already dwindling foreign reserves situation and put further strain on their ability to finance their debt obligations.  In conclusion, while Argentina may have temporarily stabilized its currency and slowed down the decline in its foreign reserves, the underlying issues plaguing its economy are far from resolved. Without significant structural reforms and a commitment to fiscal discipline, Argentina remains vulnerable to another economic crisis. The country must tackle issues such as high levels of debt, fiscal deficit reduction targets, low productivity growth, political instability, and external uncertainties head-on if it wants to avoid finding itself trapped in yet another boom-bust cycle.",continue
". This framework outlines the key areas and priorities that the applicant country needs to address and fulfill in order to become a member state.  One of these key criteria is the requirement for an applicant country to have stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for and protection of minorities. This implies that a country aspiring to join the EU must have a functioning legal system, an independent judiciary, and effective public administration.  Additionally, economic criteria play a crucial role in determining whether a country is ready to join the EU. An applicant country must demonstrate a sustainable market economy with competitive forces at work. It should also have the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU.  Furthermore, an applicant country needs to adopt and implement European Union legislation (acquis communautaire) across all sectors including justice and home affairs, agriculture and rural development, among others. This means aligning national laws with EU rules in order to ensure compatibility between existing legislation in member states.  Geographical factors are also taken into consideration when EU borders are determined. The proximity of an aspiring country's borders plays into its suitability for membership as it affects issues such as cross-border cooperation on trade, security concerns related to organized crime or migration flows.  However, it is important not only to assess whether an aspiring country meets these criteria but also any potential implications its membership might have on current member states. The expansion of co-operation within the European Union may necessitate adjustments in policies or institutions which could impact existing members economically or politically.  Once an applicant fulfills all requirements outlined by both Copenhagen criteria and negotiating frameworks set by the EU Commission, accession negotiations can begin towards establishing terms for membership. These negotiations cover various aspects including specific conditions that need fulfilling before becoming part of the European Union.  It is crucial for both parties involved - current member states as well as new applicants - that these negotiations are conducted thoroughly so that any potential issues regarding borders, policies, and institutions can be resolved in a manner that is mutually beneficial.  Determining EU borders requires a thoughtful and meticulous assessment of various factors including the applicant country's readiness to meet EU criteria, its geographical location, potential implications of membership on existing member states, and ultimately ensuring that the European Union is well-equipped to face future challenges.  In conclusion, while the determination of EU borders is not solely based on geographical considerations alone, it is an important factor taken into account. The expansion of cooperation within the European Union necessitates careful evaluation of all aspects including political stability, economic readiness, adoption of EU legislation, and geographic proximity to existing member states. Only with a comprehensive understanding of these factors can the EU make informed decisions about its borders and effectively navigate future challenges. The issue of EU borders is a complex and sensitive one, as it involves not only the practical aspects of defining the geographical limits of the Union but also considerations of political, historical, and cultural significance. The process even becomes more challenging when dealing with candidate countries located in regions where border disputes exist or where there are ongoing conflicts.  In such cases, the EU has played a vital role in promoting dialogue and conflict resolution among countries to facilitate peaceful resolutions to border disputes. The prospect of EU membership has often served as an incentive for neighboring countries to engage in negotiations and find mutually acceptable solutions.  It is worth noting that the European Union functions on the principle of solidarity among its members. Therefore, any decision regarding EU borders must take into account not only the interests of individual member states but also broader considerations related to stability, security, economic integration, and shared values.  As new challenges emerge over time - whether they are related to migration flows, security threats or changes in geopolitical dynamics - these factors may necessitate reevaluations or adjustments in determining EU borders. Flexibility and adaptability are crucial for ensuring that the Union remains effective in addressing evolving challenges while upholding its core principles.  The ""widening versus deepening"" debate often arises when discussing further enlargement of the European Union. Some argue that existing member states should focus on consolidating integration efforts before considering additional enlargements. Others believe that expansion should continue to incorporate countries committed to European values and willing to contribute positively to the Union's development.  Ultimately, any decisions regarding future EU borders require consensus among member states through diplomatic negotiations and agreement-making processes. It is a collective endeavor that demands political will from both current members and aspiring candidates alike.  In recent years there have been discussions about potential new applicants from Western Balkans including Albania,Serbia,North Macedonia,Montenegro or Bosnia-Herzegovina.Significant progress has been made by some of these nations towards fulfilling membership criteria outlined by the European Union. However, challenges still remain as each candidate country faces its own unique obstacles in terms of political stability, economic development, and institutional reforms.  As the European Union continues to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances, the determination of its borders will remain an ongoing process. It is crucial that this process is conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, with careful consideration given to all relevant factors. By doing so, the EU can ensure that any enlargement or adjustment of its borders is undertaken strategically and in line with its overarching goals of promoting peace, prosperity, and unity among member states.  In conclusion, determining EU borders is a multifaceted undertaking that requires meticulous evaluation of various criteria including geographical factors as well as political, economic ,and institutional readiness. The expansion of cooperation within the European Union must be approached cautiously but also with a long-term perspective for both current members and aspiring countries seeking membership. Ultimately ,the key objective remains fostering stability,stregthening democracy,and building a prosperous Europe based on shared values.",continue

"is the rise of a new generation of leaders in China. This transition marks a significant shift in leadership and could potentially shape the country's future trajectory.  Hu Jintao, the new General Secretary of the Communist Party, represents this new generation. He is a fresh face to many both within China and on the international stage. Unlike his predecessor Jiang Zemin, who was known for his strong personality and charisma, Hu Jintao exudes a more reserved and cautious demeanor.  As President Jiang prepares to step down from all his positions, he leaves behind a mixed legacy. Under his leadership, China experienced rapid economic growth and modernization. The country's GDP soared to unprecedented levels, lifting millions out of poverty.  However, there were also criticisms during Jiang's rule regarding human rights abuses and lack of political reforms. Many hoped that with this change in leadership comes an opportunity for progress on these fronts.  The outgoing Premier Zhu Rongji also played a crucial role in shaping China's transformation over the past decade. Known for his bold economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, Zhu was widely respected domestically as well as internationally.  Yet with these retirements comes uncertainty about how smoothly power will transition to the next generation of leaders. It remains to be seen how their policies will differ from those of their predecessors or if they will continue on similar paths.  One thing that is clear is that economic development will remain at the forefront of their agenda. For years now, maintaining high growth rates has been considered essential for social stability in China. As such, it can be expected that this new generation will prioritize sustaining economic growth while also addressing some longstanding challenges such as income inequality and environmental degradation.  Another area of interest will be political reform within the Chinese system itself. While it is unlikely that drastic changes will occur overnight or jeopardize one-party rule entirely, there are hopes that this new leadership might introduce more transparency and accountability into government affairs.  Interestingly enough, some members of this new generation come from more humble backgrounds compared to their predecessors. This could potentially bring a different perspective to the table and help address issues relating to social inequality that have plagued China for years.  Furthermore, the international community is eagerly watching how this new leadership will handle China's foreign policy. As the country continues to ascend on the global stage, questions arise about how it will assert its influence and interact with other nations.  China's relationship with the United States will undoubtedly be of utmost importance. Despite occasional tensions, both Hu Jintao and then-US President George W. Bush expressed a desire for strong bilateral ties during their respective transitions. The next few years may present opportunities for collaboration but could also test the resilience of this relationship.  Overall, there is a sense of anticipation and curiosity surrounding this new generation of leaders in China. The decisions they make and actions they take have far-reaching consequences not only for their own people but also for the rest of the world.  As they navigate various domestic and global challenges, it remains to be seen whether they can steer China towards continued growth while addressing societal issues effectively. Only time will tell if this new generation can live up to expectations or bring about meaningful change in one of the world's most influential nations.",continue
"When I first arrived in Bulgaria, it was clear that the business environment was not for the faint-hearted. The country, still in its early stages of transition from a communist regime, was struggling to find stability and establish a thriving economic system. Corruption and organized crime were prevalent, making every business decision an unpredictable gamble.  Setting up my own business importing sporting goods from Asia had already exposed me to some challenges. But when the opportunity to invest in a bicycle factory presented itself, I saw it as a chance to not only expand my entrepreneurial venture but also contribute to Bulgaria's economic growth.  The decision wasn't easy. The chaotic nature of the market fueled by mafia influence was intimidating, and the widespread existence of an underground economy made any attempt at fair competition seem futile. However, I firmly believed that with determination and strategic planning, success could be achieved even in such adverse conditions.  My journey into entrepreneurship in Bulgaria proved to be both rewarding and arduous simultaneously. It often felt like a perpetual balancing act between embracing the opportunities that arose while navigating through treacherous waters filled with unscrupulous individuals seeking personal gain at any cost.  Building relationships with local suppliers became paramount as they held knowledge about navigating bureaucratic red tape – an art form in itself within Bulgarian society back then. They helped me avoid potential pitfalls while ensuring my supply chain remained secure amidst prevalent corruption practices.  Another significant aspect of doing business in Bulgaria during those times was adapting operations to fit within an ambiguous legal framework where loopholes were exploited left and right by those who disregarded ethical considerations for financial gain. Staying compliant with regulations while avoiding being taken advantage of required constant vigilance and negotiation skills.  Yet despite these challenges, there were undeniable advantages unique to conducting business within this unconventional landscape. The lower labor costs compared to other European countries allowed us room for competitive pricing on our products without compromising quality or profitability significantly.  Furthermore, being at the forefront of developing industries offered immense potential for growth. Bulgaria's strategic location between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East made it an ideal trading hub, attracting interested parties from across the globe. This created a network of opportunities for my business that I wouldn't have found elsewhere.  Additionally, the optimistic spirit prevalent during that time was infectious. Many entrepreneurs like myself embraced the ""Wild West"" capitalism with a fierce determination to defy all odds and establish prosperous enterprises despite the challenging circumstances. We understood that perseverance and adaptability were prerequisites for success.  Over time, as Bulgaria slowly began to mature economically and politically, things started changing for SMEs like mine. The government recognized the need to tackle corruption head-on and implemented reforms aimed at fostering transparency and fair competition.  These changes brought about a more stable business environment where SMEs could thrive without constantly looking over their shoulders or encountering roadblocks at every turn. Increased foreign investment poured into diversifying industries across Bulgaria, providing new opportunities previously untapped.  Looking back on my decision to invest in Bulgaria's bicycle factory during those volatile years brings a sense of pride mixed with gratitude for having weathered such uncertain times successfully. It taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, resourcefulness, and adaptability – qualities that continue to help me navigate through challenges even now.  Ultimately, despite its initial hardships, doing business in Bulgaria proved lucrative both financially and personally. It was an adventure filled with risks but also immense rewards – not just in terms of profits but also in contributing to the economic development of a nation striving towards stability and progress.",continue
"As a result, emerging market economies are facing significant economic challenges that cannot be ignored. While these nations were initially seen as immune to the global crisis, it has become evident that they are not entirely spared from its impact.  The decline in international financial flows has greatly affected emerging markets. As developed countries grapple with their own economic struggles, investors have become more cautious and risk-averse. This has resulted in a decrease in capital flows to emerging markets as investors seek safer investments elsewhere. The reduction in foreign investment can have severe consequences for these economies as it hampers their ability to fund infrastructure projects and stimulate growth.  Furthermore, the drop in commodity prices has dealt a heavy blow to many emerging market economies heavily reliant on exports of natural resources such as oil, metals, and agricultural goods. With global demand shrinking due to the sluggish economic conditions worldwide, prices have plummeted considerably. This sharp fall drastically reduces the revenue generated from exports, obstructing economic progress and development.  The sudden contraction of credit flow from major developed countries further exacerbates the challenges faced by emerging markets. As banks tighten lending standards and reduce exposure to riskier assets amid uncertainty regarding the future direction of global growth, access to external financing becomes increasingly limited for these nations. Reduced credit availability hinders businesses' ability to expand and invest while also impeding consumer spending power.  Governments of emerging market economies are now grappling with balancing fiscal prudence while simultaneously stimulating their economies amid this crisis. They face difficult choices concerning whether or not to engage in countercyclical measures such as increasing government spending or implementing expansionary monetary policies that run counterintuitive during downturns but may prove necessary for jump-starting growth.  While some argue that fiscal stimulus can lead to long-term debt burdens and inflationary pressures if not appropriately managed, others believe it is crucial for providing much-needed liquidity into fragile economies struggling with reduced private sector activity.  In response to these challenges, several emerging market governments have implemented policies to bolster their economies. These measures include interest rate cuts, fiscal stimulus packages, and targeted support for vulnerable sectors. However, the effectiveness of these efforts varies across different nations as they grapple with unique economic circumstances and limited policy space.  The path to recovery for emerging markets amidst this global crisis remains uncertain. The extent of the damage inflicted by the economic downturn is yet to be fully realized, further complicating efforts for revival. Moreover, newfound challenges such as rising social unrest and political instability add additional layers of complexity that impede timely recuperation.  Despite these obstacles, many emerging market economies have demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity throughout history. By implementing sound economic policies and structural reforms focused on diversifying their industries and improving productivity, these nations can mitigate the impact of external shocks while fostering long-term sustainable growth.  As the global economy gradually recovers from this crisis, it is crucial that developed countries recognize the interdependence between their own well-being and that of emerging markets. Collaborative efforts must be undertaken to facilitate a sustainable recovery globally while also addressing imbalances in trade and finance systems to enhance stability in an interconnected world economy.  In conclusion, emerging markets have not been spared from the challenges posed by the global crisis. Declining international financial flows, plummeting commodity prices, reduced credit availability – all contribute to significant economic hardships faced by these nations. Governments must navigate carefully through this turbulent period by implementing prudent policies aimed at restoring confidence while nurturing long-term growth strategies that enhance resilience against future crises. International cooperation will play an instrumental role in achieving a truly inclusive recovery worldwide.",continue
"inequalities in terms of wealth and poverty. India is home to a staggering number of billionaires, yet it also has one-third of the world's poor population living below the poverty line.  The charts and figures depicting India's economic growth and population size can often overshadow the reality on the ground. Behind these numbers are real people with real stories that paint a more nuanced picture of a country undergoing tremendous transformation.  One cannot ignore the remarkable progress India has made in various sectors. The booming IT industry has put cities like Bangalore on the global map as technology hubs, creating countless job opportunities for skilled professionals. New Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai have become thriving financial centers attracting major investments from around the world.  However, beyond these urban centers lies an entirely different story. Rural areas continue to face numerous challenges - inadequate infrastructure, lack of access to basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation facilities, and limited educational opportunities. The rural-urban divide is glaringly apparent when one ventures outside major cities.  India's demographic dividend - its large young population - is often touted as an advantage for future growth. However, it also poses immense challenges for education and employment opportunities. With a vast youth population aspiring for better lives, there is immense pressure on the government to create jobs at a rate that matches this demand.  Another crucial aspect that goes beyond charts is gender inequality in India society. Despite significant progress in recent years regarding women empowerment initiatives such as education campaigns and legal reforms addressing gender-based violence, there remains a long way to go before true gender equality can be achieved across all sections of society.  These complex issues cannot be understood by simply looking at numerical data alone; they require putting faces to those numbers — hearing stories from individuals who are grappling with these realities every day.  Consider Rajesh Kumar from rural Bihar – among millions like him who migrate to cities seeking work due to limited employment prospects in their villages. Rajesh left his family behind three years ago to work as a construction worker in Delhi. He shares a cramped room with six others, sending most of his earnings back home to support his family. While the numbers might show economic growth for the country, Rajesh's story reminds us of the sacrifices made by countless individuals striving for a better life.  Similarly, Sarita Devi's story highlights the plight of many women across India. Despite being educated and talented, Sarita faces discrimination at her workplace due to prevailing gender biases. She encounters hurdles in climbing the corporate ladder and earning equal pay as her male colleagues. Her story shows that although progress has been made towards women's empowerment, there is still work to be done to ensure true gender equality in India.  These stories remind us that India is more than just charts and figures. They shed light on the struggles and aspirations of its diverse population - each person facing unique challenges amidst rapid societal changes.  To truly understand India and its dynamic nature, we must listen to these stories, acknowledging both progress and setbacks along the way. It is only then that we can paint an accurate picture beyond numerical data – one that captures the resilience and determination of its people on their journey towards a brighter future for all Indians",continue
"terms , China will be the world's largest economy according to the World Bank . This is driven in large part by the rise of the Chinese consumer.  There are several factors contributing to this growth. First and foremost, China's middle class is expanding at an unprecedented rate. As more people move out of poverty and into the middle class, their purchasing power increases significantly. This trend is expected to continue as more rural areas develop and urbanization spreads across the country.  Furthermore, Chinese consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and discerning. They no longer solely focus on basic necessities but also prioritize quality, safety, and luxury goods. This shift in consumer behavior has created opportunities for international brands that can cater to these demands.  Another important aspect shaping the rise of the Chinese consumer is technology. The ubiquity of smartphones has transformed how consumers shop and interact with brands. E-commerce platforms like Alibaba's Taobao have made it easier for individuals to access a wide range of products from around the world with just a few taps on their mobile devices.  The government has also played a significant role in promoting domestic consumption as part of its economic development strategy. Policies such as tax cuts, subsidies for certain industries, and relaxing regulations have all aimed at stimulating consumer spending.  Moreover, increased urbanization has led to changes in lifestyle preferences among Chinese consumers. They now place greater emphasis on experiences rather than material possessions alone. This shift has fueled growth in sectors such as tourism, entertainment, dining out, and recreational activities.  However, challenges still exist that must be navigated carefully by businesses looking to tap into this burgeoning market. For instance:  1) Regulation: The complexity surrounding regulations related to imports/export procedures can make it difficult for foreign companies seeking entry into China's consumer market. 2) Competition: Both domestic companies and international brands face fierce competition from each other within various sectors. 3) Local preferences: Understanding local tastes and adapting products or services accordingly is crucial for success in penetrating the Chinese consumer market. 4) Distribution channels: Establishing efficient distribution networks and partnerships that can reach China's vast geography is a daunting task. Resource allocation must be carefully considered to maximize returns.  Despite these challenges, the opportunities presented by the rise of the Chinese consumer cannot be ignored. With a population of over 1.4 billion and an expanding middle class, businesses that are able to adapt their strategies to cater to this market stand to benefit greatly.  Moreover, as China continues with its economic reforms and opens up further to foreign investment, it is expected that additional avenues for growth will emerge. The Belt and Road Initiative is just one example of how China aims to expand its influence globally while simultaneously stimulating domestic consumption.  In conclusion, while the current size of the Chinese consumer market may not yet rival some of its counterparts like the US or Europe, its trajectory suggests significant growth potential in the years ahead. By understanding local preferences, leveraging technology, adapting distribution strategies, and navigating regulatory challenges wisely - businesses can position themselves for success in this dynamic marketplace. As China continues on its path towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, it is essential for companies around the world to seize opportunities offered by this rising wave of Chinese consumers.",continue
"stability and play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of the Swiss economy.  One of the primary functions of large banks is to provide financial intermediation services. This involves facilitating the flow of funds from savers to borrowers, ensuring that capital is allocated efficiently throughout the economy. By offering a wide range of banking services such as deposits, loans, and payment systems, big banks enable individuals and businesses to manage their finances effectively. They act as intermediaries by accepting deposits from customers and providing loans for various purposes such as housing, business investments, or consumer spending.  Furthermore, large banks play an important role in asset management. They not only manage investment portfolios for individual clients but also offer various investment products like mutual funds and pension funds for broader market participation. These asset management services help individuals grow their wealth over time while diversifying their risks across different asset classes. Moreover, these services attract international investors who seek professional expertise in managing their assets within a stable economic environment.  Additionally, big banks possess robust investment banking divisions that provide support for corporate finance activities including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), initial public offerings (IPOs), debt issuance, underwriting securities offerings, advisory services, and more. Investment banking plays a critical role in driving economic growth by facilitating capital formation through equity financing or debt markets. Large banks with extensive networks have access to global capital markets which enables them to assist companies in raising funds both domestically and abroad.  The contribution of large banks goes beyond just financial intermediation; they also foster innovation within the economy through research departments that analyze market trends and offer insights on emerging industries or technologies. By providing expert advice on potential investment opportunities or risks associated with certain sectors or regions globally or domestically , these institutions contribute significantly towards informed decision making by investors.  Moreover , as global players , big banks are instrumental in supporting international trade by offering trade financing solutions such as letters of credit , export credits , foreign exchange transactions etc . These services facilitate cross-border transactions and mitigate risks for businesses involved in global trade.  However, the concentration and size of big banks also pose risks to the economy. The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated how the failure of large banks can have a devastating impact on the global financial system. To address this concern, regulators have imposed stricter regulations on these institutions to ensure their stability and mitigate systemic risks. Banks are now required to hold higher capital buffers, improve risk management practices, undergo regular stress tests, and comply with stringent reporting requirements.  In conclusion, large banks such as Credit Suisse and UBS play a critical role in supporting the Swiss economy as pillars of stability. They provide essential financial intermediation services that ensure efficient allocation of capital throughout the economy. Their asset management divisions contribute to wealth creation for individuals while attracting international investors to Switzerland. Additionally, investment banking activities drive economic growth by facilitating corporate finance activities and innovation through research departments. Although these institutions present risks due to their size and interconnectedness with global markets, regulators have implemented measures to enhance their stability. In summary, a strong financial sector led by big banks is crucial for maintaining a healthy Swiss economy and its position as an international hub for finance. ",continue
"environment for equities. However, the path towards this global recovery is likely to be uneven, with central banks playing a crucial role in shaping market dynamics.  Currently, the United States and Europe find themselves at different stages of their economic recoveries. The US Federal Reserve has already started tapering its monetary stimulus and is expected to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. On the other hand, the European Central Bank continues to provide accommodative policies in an effort to stimulate economic growth and combat deflationary pressures.  This divergence in monetary policy presents an interesting opportunity for investors. O'Sullivan believes that companies located in countries where central banks are still easing will benefit from lower borrowing costs and improved business conditions. These companies are likely to see a boost in their profitability and valuations, making them attractive investment prospects.  One region that stands out in this context is emerging markets. With countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa continuing with loose monetary policies, these economies have room for further growth potential compared to their developed counterparts. Additionally, their relatively attractive valuations make them appealing investments for risk-seeking investors.  Furthermore, China's central bank also remains supportive of its economy as it seeks to navigate through structural reforms without causing excessive disruption. This policy stance could translate into additional opportunities within Chinese equities as businesses receive ongoing support from easy credit conditions.  However, not all emerging markets are created equal when it comes to investment prospects amid divergent central bank actions. Investors would need careful scrutiny of individual country fundamentals before allocating capital towards them.  Additionally, while equities may seem like an attractive asset class amidst diverging central bank policies globally; risks still persist due to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 variants or geopolitical tensions across different regions—highlighting the importance of prudent risk management strategies when investing during such times of uncertainty  Moreover , it's essential not forgetting that diverging monetary policies do have consequences beyond just equity markets . As central banks tighten or ease their policies , currency exchange rates can be significantly impacted. A rising interest-rate environment in the United States, for example , could lead to a stronger US dollar, which may adversely affect emerging market economies that have high levels of debt denominated in foreign currencies.  Overall, investors need to carefully navigate through these divergent central bank policies and assess country-by-country opportunities based on relative valuations, growth prospects, and risk appetite. While equities in countries with dovish central banks may present attractive investment opportunities, prudence is necessary given the uncertain global landscape.  In conclusion , as central banks continue to diverge in their monetary policies, eq uites may experience a divergence as well. While some regions and countries may see outperformance in their equity markets, others may face challenges. It is crucial to consider the broader economic conditions and factors that can influence investment outcomes.  In addition to monetary policy, other variables such as fiscal policy, inflation rates, geopolitical tensions, and overall market sentiment can also impact equity markets. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis is needed to make informed investment decisions.  Furthermore, investors should not solely focus on the short-term implications of divergent central bank policies but also consider the long-term consequences. For instance, if an economy continues with loose monetary policies for an extended period without addressing structural issues or implementing reforms, it could lead to imbalances and fragilities in the long run.  Moreover , global coordination among central banks is critical in managing the potential risks arising from divergent policies. Collaborative efforts can help minimize spillover effects on financial markets and promote stability.  For individual investors seeking exposure to equities during this period of divergence, diversification becomes even more important. Spreading investments across different asset classes and regions can help mitigate risks associated with diverging central bank actions.  Additionally , it is important for investors to stay updated with the latest developments related to central bank actions globally. Changes in policy outlooks or unexpected shifts in economic conditions can have significant impacts on market dynamics.  Finally , it's worth noting that while divergence between central banks' monetary policies presents opportunities for potential gains in certain areas of equities markets it also carries inherent risks such as increased volatility or sudden shifts in investor sentiment . As such , careful risk management strategies along with regular portfolio reviews are essential .  In conclusion , as central banks continue their divergent paths regarding monetary policy , equities are likely to experience divergences as well . Countries and regions where central banks continue easing measures might present attractive opportunities for investors due to favorable business conditions arising from lower borrowing costs . However , evaluating individual country fundamentals and considering other factors such as fiscal policy and geopolitical tensions is necessary for making informed investment decisions . Furthermore , global coordination among central banks is crucial to manage potential risks associated with divergent policies . Overall , investors should remain vigilant, diversify their portfolios, and stay updated with market developments to navigate through the complexities of diverging central bank actions in equity markets.",continue
"which he won against David Ferrer, was Federer's 80th career title. It marked a significant milestone in his already illustrious career, reaffirming his status as one of the sport's greatest champions.  But as Federer savored this victory and prepared for the US Open, there was one key ingredient that had contributed to his recent success—a secret elixir that had propelled him to new heights on the court. This elixir, a special concoction of herbal supplements and vitamins formulated by a renowned sports nutritionist, had revolutionized Federer's approach to training and recovery.  It all started when Federer faced a series of setbacks earlier in the season. Struggling with injuries and poor form, he knew he needed to make some significant changes if he wanted to remain competitive at the highest level. That was when he crossed paths with Dr. Lucas Chambers.  Dr. Chambers was known within professional sports circles for his groundbreaking work in optimizing athletes' performance through nutrition. Having heard about Federer's struggles, he reached out offering his expertise. Intrigued by the proposition of finding an edge over his rivals through dietary means, Federer agreed to meet with Dr. Chambers.

It was a defining moment for both Federer and Dr. Chambers.  The secret elixir became the topic of speculation in the tennis world, with pundits and fans desperate to uncover its ingredients. However, Federer remained tight-lipped about the specifics, not wanting his competitors to gain access to this precious formula.  As Federer prepared for his journey to New York, he reflected on how this small vial of elixir had transformed his career in such a short span of time. It wasn't just the physical benefits that impressed him but also the mental aspect—the renewed sense of confidence and belief that he could still compete at the highest level against younger opponents.  As he bid farewell to Cincinnati, Federer couldn't help but feel a profound sense of gratitude towards Dr. Lucas Chambers.

"result of the implementation of stricter immigration regulations. These factors, along with global economic uncertainties, are leading economists to suggest that the Swiss economy is coming to the end of its super-cycle.  One key driver that has fueled Switzerland's economic growth over the past decade is the booming residential property market. However, in recent years, various measures have been put in place to curb excessive price rises and prevent a housing bubble. As a result, the growth in property prices has already started to weaken and is expected to continue cooling in 2015.  The introduction of stricter lending standards and higher mortgage rates have contributed to this slowdown. Additionally, measures such as increased taxes on second homes and stricter regulation on rental contracts have made it more difficult for investors and speculators to profit from rising property prices. This cooling effect on the housing market will likely dampen consumer spending and slow down overall economic growth.  Another major contributor to Switzerland's economic success has been immigration. Over the past decade, an influx of foreign workers has helped drive productivity gains and fill labor gaps in various sectors of the economy. However, political pressure from anti-immigration groups led to a referendum in 2014 where voters opted for stricter immigration controls.  As a result, net immigration is expected to decline moderately in 2014 but should intensify further in 2015 as new regulations take effect. The implementation of quotas for EU immigrants will limit their access to jobs and require employers to prioritize Swiss residents first. This could lead to labor shortages in certain industries that heavily rely on foreign workers.  The end of this era of high immigration could impact both productivity levels and wage growth. With fewer skilled workers entering Switzerland, companies may struggle with meeting their labor demands which could hinder innovation and overall productivity gains.  Furthermore, lower population growth will also put pressure on government finances as they face challenges maintaining a social welfare system with an aging demographic profile. The strain on public resources may lead policymakers towards implementing austerity measures to balance the budget, potentially dampening economic growth even further.  Global economic uncertainties also pose significant risks to the Swiss economy in 2015. Switzerland is highly dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for a substantial portion of its GDP. The ongoing economic slowdown in China and the eurozone's fragile recovery could dampen demand for Swiss goods and services, negatively impacting export-oriented industries such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, and luxury goods.  In conclusion, while Switzerland has enjoyed a prosperous period of economic growth fueled by a super-cycle driven by property prices and immigration, signs are pointing towards this cycle coming to an end. Cooling property prices and declining net immigration are already indicating slower growth prospects for 2015. Additionally, global economic uncertainties present further challenges for Switzerland's export-oriented sectors. Policymakers will need to navigate these headwinds carefully by implementing targeted measures to stimulate domestic demand and promote innovation in order to sustain future economic growth. To mitigate the potential slowdown and adapt to changing economic conditions, Swiss policymakers will likely need to implement a range of strategies. One approach could involve stimulating domestic demand by promoting investment and consumption. This could be achieved through fiscal measures such as tax cuts or targeted spending on infrastructure projects.  Investment in innovation and research and development (R&D) will also be crucial to strengthen Switzerland's competitiveness in the global market. By encouraging businesses to invest in new technologies, product development, and process improvements, the country can maintain its position as a hub for innovation.  Moreover, diversifying export markets will be vital for reducing dependence on specific regions such as the EU or China. Swiss companies should explore emerging markets with growing consumer bases like Southeast Asia and Latin America. Strengthening trade relationships with these regions can help offset any potential decline in demand from traditional trading partners.  Addressing labor shortages caused by stricter immigration controls will require a multi-faceted approach. Encouraging investment in education and training programs can help develop the skills needed within industries facing shortages of skilled workers. Fostering collaboration between industry stakeholders, educational institutions, and government agencies can facilitate the identification of skill gaps and design tailored training programs.  Additionally, Switzerland may need to reconsider its immigration policies to ensure that it attracts high-skilled workers who can contribute to its economy effectively while addressing public concerns about unemployment among Swiss residents.  In terms of housing policy, finding a balance between ensuring affordable housing options for all income groups while avoiding speculative bubbles will be paramount. Policymakers may consider implementing measures that promote long-term stability in residential property prices while ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing for both renters and buyers.  Furthermore, strengthening social safety nets will become increasingly important due to an aging population resulting from declining net immigration rates. The government must anticipate future demographic changes by developing comprehensive retirement plans that address funding sustainability while guaranteeing support for elderly citizens.  While there are challenges ahead for the Swiss economy, it has a strong foundation of economic stability and a highly skilled workforce. By embracing innovation, diversifying export markets, and addressing labor shortages strategically, Switzerland can weather the end of the super-cycle and set itself on a path for sustained long-term growth.  Overall, while there may be some headwinds ahead for the Swiss economy in 2015 and beyond, proactive measures taken by policymakers and businesses can help navigate these challenges successfully. With a focus on promoting domestic demand, fostering innovation, diversifying markets, addressing labor shortages thoughtfully, and strengthening social safety nets - Switzerland can continue to position itself as a resilient and dynamic player in the global economy.",continue
"the dollar began in 2014, solidifying its position as the dominant currency in the global market. This surge came as a result of various factors, including an improving U.S. economy, diverging monetary policy from other major economies, and geopolitical events that increased demand for safe-haven assets.  The U.S. economy was on the path to recovery after the global financial crisis of 2008. As interest rates started to rise and unemployment levels decreased, investors gained confidence in the strength of the American economy. With higher interest rates, foreign capital flowed into U.S. financial markets seeking better returns, thus driving up demand for dollars.  At the same time, major central banks around the world were implementing different monetary policies. While countries like Japan and Europe were easing their monetary policies by implementing negative interest rates and quantitative easing measures to stimulate their economies, the U.S Federal Reserve embarked on tightening measures by tapering its bond-buying program and discussing potential rate hikes.  This divergence in monetary policy created a significant advantage for the dollar compared to other currencies. The prospect of higher yields attracted investors seeking stable returns amidst global economic uncertainties.  Geopolitical events further fueled demand for safe-haven assets and boosted international confidence in holding dollars. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated throughout 2014, resulting in economic sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries. These sanctions led to a flight to safety with investors rushing towards safer assets such as U.S Treasuries and dollars.  Furthermore, emerging markets faced significant headwinds during this period due to a slowdown in China's growth rate and declining commodity prices. As these economies struggled with high debt levels and capital outflows intensified, their currencies depreciated against the dollar even further enhancing its strength.  Despite some fluctuations throughout 2014 due to short-term market volatilities or temporary shifts in sentiment towards riskier assets like stocks or other currencies at certain points within that year; overall trends pointed towards a sustained upward trajectory for the dollar.  Looking ahead, Credit Suisse's foreign exchange analysts predict that the dollar will continue to strengthen over the next few years. They highlight that although interest rates play a crucial role in driving the dollar's value, other factors such as economic growth, inflation differentials, and geopolitics also influence currency movements.  One of their key reasons for projecting further strength in the dollar is based on expectations of continued solid economic growth in the United States. With increasing consumer spending, business investment, and job creation, the U.S. economy is expected to outperform its global counterparts.  Additionally, uncertainties surrounding other major currencies such as Brexit and ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States are likely to drive investors towards safer assets like dollars. The stability of the U.S. financial system and its status as a safe haven make it an attractive option during times of global uncertainty.  However, it is important to note that currency markets can be unpredictable in some instances. Factors like shifts in central bank policies or unforeseen events may challenge these projections. It is crucial for investors and businesses alike to stay informed about global economic developments and carefully manage their exposure to currency risks.  In conclusion, 2014 marked the beginning of a multi-year bull market for the dollar with various factors propelling its strength: an improving U.S economy compared to other major economies worldwide; diverging monetary policies among central banks; geopolitical tensions increasing demand for safe-haven assets; struggles faced by emerging markets; all contributed towards enhancing value perceptions regarding holding dollars relative to other currencies on a long-term basis. Looking forward into 2015 and beyond provides positive prospects for further appreciation of USD values against major global alternatives due primarily if not exclusively (if nothing else it provides especially) because these trends evidenced positive overall net flows globally favoring USD stability especially given market expectations suggesting this trend will likely remain consistent going forward amidst developing macroeconomic sensitivities potentially impacting other major currencies.",continue
"In the years following the publication of this report, several developments have taken place that have necessitated a revisiting of these EMU scenarios. The muddling-through scenario seemed to be the prevailing narrative for some time, as European leaders attempted to contain and manage the crisis without making any significant breakthroughs toward stabilization.  However, it became increasingly clear that simply muddling through would not be enough to address the underlying issues plaguing the EMU. As economies continued to struggle and debt levels soared in countries such as Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal, it became evident that more decisive action was needed.  The worsening crisis scenario started becoming a reality as market pressures intensified. In 2012, with borrowing costs for struggling countries skyrocketing and Greek elections leading to political uncertainty, eurozone leaders were forced to take decisive action. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced its intention to do whatever it takes to preserve the Eurozone's stability. This commitment was followed by various measures such as massive bond-buying programs (Quantitative Easing) and later on massive stimulus packages (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme), all aimed at stabilizing financial markets and promoting growth.  This shift in strategy marked a turning point in addressing the crisis within the EMU. It demonstrated a recognition by policymakers that deeper integration was necessary if they wanted to prevent further deterioration of the situation.  As doubts about fiscal sustainability grew and concerns over banking sector stability mounted in some countries, there was increasing recognition of the need for a fiscal union within Europe. This positive-side scenario gained traction as discussions around tighter fiscal coordination among member states gained momentum.  Efforts toward establishing stricter rules on budget deficits - like those outlined in the Stability and Growth Pact - were reinforced with new mechanisms such as fiscal compacts or banking unions intended for more rigorous oversight over national budgets or financial institutions respectively.  While progress has been made towards greater fiscal coordination within Europe since then through these mechanisms, the path to a full-fledged fiscal union remains uncertain.  On the negative side, there were always concerns that the crisis could lead to a break-up of the monetary union altogether. The possibility of one or more countries exiting the euro was widely debated as some argued that weaker economies may benefit from regaining control over monetary policy and devaluing their currencies.  However, despite occasional moments of instability and political turmoil in certain countries like Greece or Italy, no country has yet made a definitive move towards leaving the Eurozone. The costs and uncertainties associated with such a drastic step have proven too high to be seriously considered.  Nevertheless, it is important to note that challenges still persist within the EMU. Disparities in economic performance among member states persist and issues such as high levels of public debt and structural reforms remain unresolved. These challenges highlight that while progress has been made since 2011, there is still work to be done to ensure long-term stability within the euro area.  In conclusion, revisiting EMU scenarios reveals both successes and ongoing challenges. While decisive action has been taken through massive stimulus programs and efforts towards greater fiscal coordination are underway, establishing a full-fledged fiscal union remains elusive. Moreover, though talk of a break-up has diminished in recent years due to economic realities, underlying issues continue to persist within certain member states. It is evident that finding sustainable solutions for these challenges will require continued commitment from European leaders and stakeholders alike in order to secure stability within EMU for future generations.",continue
"there is much more to Renoir's talent than what meets the eye. His early works reveal a unique style and an innate ability to capture light and movement that set him apart from his fellow Impressionists.  Renoir, along with Monet, Pissarro, and others, was at the forefront of the Impressionist movement in the late 19th century. Their revolutionary approach to art challenged traditional techniques and embraced direct observation of their subjects. Renoir's early works exemplify this innovative spirit as he sought to capture not just the physical appearance of his subjects but also their essence.  One such example is Renoir's painting ""Luncheon of the Boating Party,"" which portrays a group of friends enjoying a leisurely afternoon on a balcony overlooking the Seine River. The vibrant colors and loose brushstrokes give life and energy to each individual in the scene. Renoir masterfully captures both their distinct personalities and their interaction with one another, creating a sense of joyous camaraderie.  Another noteworthy aspect of Renoir's early work is his skillful depiction of everyday life scenes. His paintings often depict ordinary people engaged in simple activities such as strolling through parks or enjoying outdoor gatherings. Despite their seemingly mundane nature, these paintings evoke a sense of tranquility and appreciation for life's small pleasures.  In addition to his exceptional technique, it is important to recognize Renoir's contribution to pushing art beyond traditional gender roles. While it may be true that he painted numerous nudes throughout his career, dismissing them as mere clichés undermines his intentions. By portraying women confidently embracing their own bodies, Renoir challenged societal norms that often constrained female sexuality within narrow boundaries.  Furthermore, when examining Renoir's later works more closely, one can find subtleties that defy initial judgments. It becomes evident that beneath what may seem like repetitive motifs lies an exploration of different themes such as love, sensuality, and the passage of time. Through his unique use of color, texture, and composition, Renoir transforms seemingly banal subjects into meditations on the human experience.  To truly appreciate Renoir's artistic evolution, one must embrace a balanced view that encompasses both his early and later works. By doing so, we can recognize the depth and range of his talent as well as the significant contributions he made to Impressionism as a whole.  A Renoir revival is long overdue. It is time for art enthusiasts and critics alike to revisit Renoir's oeuvre with fresh eyes and open minds. By looking beyond the surface-level criticisms often associated with his later works, we can rediscover the brilliance of his earlier paintings that influenced an entire generation of artists.  In a period marked by innovation and experimentation in art, it is essential not to overlook an artist who was at its forefront. Renoir's early works provide insight into his artistic genius while also demonstrating how he shaped Impressionism as a movement. Let us celebrate this remarkable artist by embracing all facets of his work – both celebrated and controversial – for they are all part of what makes Renoir an enduring figure in art history.",continue
"times higher than in the late 1990s. While the public sector has deleveraged, private sector borrowing has surged, creating a potential vulnerability for emerging markets.  Garthwaite emphasized that this private sector leverage is largely driven by China. He stated that China's domestic debt stands at a whopping 254% of GDP, which is significantly higher than the global average of 173%. This level of debt poses risks to the Chinese economy and could have spillover effects on other emerging markets as well.  Another concerning aspect is the lack of structural reforms in many emerging markets. Garthwaite noted that although some countries have made progress in implementing reforms, such as India with its Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform, many others have not taken sufficient steps to address their structural issues. These include problems with corruption, inefficient governance systems, and inadequate infrastructure. Without these much-needed reforms, it will be challenging for these economies to sustain long-term growth.  The third concern highlighted by Garthwaite is geopolitical risks. Emerging markets are often more exposed to political instability and conflicts compared to developed economies. Recent events such as trade tensions between the United States and China or political unrest in countries like Turkey or Brazil highlight how vulnerable these markets can be to external shocks. Political instability not only affects investor confidence but can also disrupt economic activities leading to lower growth prospects.  Lastly, Garthwaite highlighted the risk of inflation in emerging market economies. With tight labor market conditions and rising wages in some countries alongside increased fiscal spending plans by governments, inflationary pressures could arise. Central banks may respond by tightening monetary policy through interest rate hikes which could significantly impact businesses' ability to invest and consumers' ability to spend.  Despite these concerns, there are reasons for optimism regarding emerging markets' performance going forward. Firstly, many EMs today boast better fiscal balances due to improved fiscal discipline over time as compared with late 1990's. Stronger fiscal positions allow governments to respond flexibly during economic downturns through stimulus measures, which can help maintain growth.  Secondly, demographics continue to work in favor of emerging markets. These economies often have young and growing populations that contribute to increased domestic consumption and a productive workforce. This demographic advantage has the potential to drive sustainable growth in the long term.  Moreover, emerging markets are becoming more integrated into the global economy. As their economies become more open, they benefit from increased trade and foreign direct investment flows which can boost productivity and drive economic growth.  In conclusion, while there are challenges facing emerging markets that could impact their performance, there are also reasons for optimism. Structural reforms, economic stability, fiscal discipline and favorable demographics all contribute to their resilience. However, caution must be exercised due to private sector leverage and potential geopolitical risks. Investors need to carefully evaluate individual countries' circumstances before making investment decisions in the emerging market space as performance may vary greatly from one country to another.  Additionally, technological advancements and digital innovation also present opportunities for emerging markets. Many countries in these regions are adopting technology at a rapid pace, which can drive efficiency gains and promote productivity growth. Emerging market companies that embrace technology have the potential to leapfrog their developed counterparts and gain a competitive edge.  Furthermore, global trends such as the shift toward sustainable development and renewable energy sources can also benefit emerging markets. These economies often have abundant natural resources like solar or wind power, which can be harnessed for clean energy production. As developed countries seek to reduce their carbon footprint and invest in renewable energy, there may be increased demand for products and services from emerging market companies operating in these sectors.  Another factor that could support the performance of emerging markets is the accommodative monetary policy stance adopted by many central banks worldwide. With interest rates at historically low levels or even negative in some cases, investors are searching for yield-generating opportunities beyond traditional asset classes. This hunt for returns may lead them towards higher-yielding assets in emerging markets where potential investment gains outweigh the associated risks.  However, it is crucial to acknowledge specific country-level risks inherent within each emerging market economy. Factors such as political stability, regulatory environment, governance standards, and overall systemic risk should be carefully considered when investing in these regions.  Moreover, events such as sudden changes in government policies or regulations can significantly impact investor sentiment and create turmoil within financial markets. Therefore, thorough due diligence on individual countries' economic fundamentals is essential before allocating capital to these markets.  Additionally, during times of heightened global uncertainty or economic volatility (such as geopolitical tensions or recessions), investors tend to adopt a risk-off approach by reallocating capital from riskier assets like equities towards safer havens like bonds or cash equivalents. This flight-to-safety phenomenon may adversely affect emerging market investments due to their higher perceived risk profile compared with developed economies.  In summary, while there are both opportunities and challenges facing emerging markets, their overall performance will depend on a myriad of factors such as economic reforms, geopolitical stability, technological advancements, and favorable demographics. With proper risk assessment and a diversified investment approach, investors can potentially benefit from the growth potential that emerging markets offer. However, it is essential to remain vigilant and stay informed about evolving market dynamics and shifts in global trends to make well-informed investment decisions in these rapidly changing economies.",continue

"status in the near future.   EU accession is crucial to Serbia's economic prosperity for several reasons. Firstly, becoming a member of the EU would provide Serbia with access to the largest single market in the world. This would open up vast opportunities for Serbian businesses to trade freely with other EU member states, increasing export potential and attracting foreign direct investment. With a population of over 500 million people, the EU market offers a significant customer base that can drive economic growth and create jobs.  Secondly, EU accession would bring about harmonization of Serbian laws and regulations with those of EU member states. This alignment would not only improve legal certainty but also facilitate greater integration into regional and global value chains. Meeting EU standards in areas such as product quality, safety, and environmental protection would enable Serbian companies to compete on equal footing with their European counterparts.  Moreover, joining the EU would ensure access to various funding programs aimed at supporting socio-economic development in member states. Through these programs, Serbia could benefit from financial resources allocated for infrastructure projects, job creation initiatives, research and innovation schemes, as well as support for rural development and agriculture sectors.  Furthermore, being part of the European Union provides Serbia with political stability and security guarantees that are vital for attracting foreign investors. Potential investors seek stable environments where property rights are protected by robust legal systems. Membership in the EU signifies adherence to democratic norms and institutions which enhance investor confidence.  EU membership also promotes good governance practices through anti-corruption measures, transparency initiatives, and rule-of-law reforms. These efforts help create an environment conducive to business growth while ensuring fair competition among market participants.  In addition to economic benefits associated with membership in the European Union’s customs union and single market; Serbia’s integration into Euro-Atlantic structures strengthens regional stability by fostering cooperation among neighboring countries.This collaboration contributes towards resolving political disputes peacefully rather than resorting to armed conflicts or aggression which negatively impact social cohesion,economic well-being,and overall development.  However, Serbia still faces some challenges on its path to EU accession. One of the main obstacles is the normalization of relations with Kosovo. The EU has made it clear that resolving this issue is crucial for Serbia's progress in the accession process. Continued dialogue and compromise are necessary to find a mutually agreeable solution.  Furthermore, Serbia needs to continue implementing structural reforms, particularly in areas such as the judiciary, public administration, and the fight against corruption. Strengthening these institutions will contribute not only to meeting EU standards but also assist in building a more resilient and transparent economy.  Overall, achieving full EU candidacy status and eventually becoming a member would undoubtedly bring numerous economic benefits and opportunities for Serbia. However, it requires consistent efforts from both Serbian authorities and citizens to meet the required criteria for membership. By taking advantage of these opportunities, Serbia can unlock its full potential for economic prosperity within a larger European community that values democracy, stability, and mutual cooperation.  To conclude, EU accession remains crucial for Serbia's economic future as it provides access to a larger market, enhances legal certainty through harmonization with EU standards,and offers support through various funding programs.Serbia must address challenges related to conflicts resolution with Kosovo as well as continue implementing important structural reforms.This journey towards membership requires dedication from both political leaders and citizens alike,but ultimately holds promising prospects for sustainable growth,economic competitiveness,and improved living standards",continue
"lead to higher returns. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""liquidity premium."" Essentially, investors are compensated for holding less liquid assets by earning higher rates of return.  But what drives this liquidity premium? Is it purely a rational economic decision, or are there psychological factors at play as well? In recent years, the field of behavioral finance has shed light on how psychology can influence investment decisions.  One important concept in psychology that ties into liquidity is loss aversion. Loss aversion refers to the idea that people feel the pain of losses more intensely than they feel the pleasure of gains. This psychological bias can impact investment decisions in several ways.  Firstly, investors may be willing to pay a premium for liquidity because it provides them with peace of mind. Knowing that they can easily sell their investments if needed reduces feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. The ability to quickly convert assets into cash provides a sense of security and control over one's financial situation.  Loss aversion also plays a role when it comes to selling less liquid assets during times of market stress or downturns. Investors tend to become more risk-averse during these periods and prefer highly liquid instruments like cash or Treasury bonds. The fear of losing even more money becomes dominant, leading individuals to prioritize liquidity over potential high returns.  Moreover, another psychological factor at play in understanding the relationship between psychology and liquidity is herd behavior. People have an inclination to follow the actions and decisions of others when making financial choices. In times of market uncertainty, this tendency intensifies as individuals look for cues from others on how to behave.  This herd mentality can lead investors to flock towards more liquid assets during volatile periods as they observe others doing so too. The belief that others must know something they don't creates an illusion of safety in numbers and reinforces the preference for liquidity over potentially higher returns from illiquid investments.  Another psychological aspect worth considering is cognitive biases such as availability bias and anchoring bias. Availability bias refers to the tendency to rely on readily available information when making decisions. When it comes to liquidity, individuals might be influenced by recent experiences of easily accessing their funds if needed, leading them to overestimate their need for liquidity.  On the other hand, anchoring bias occurs when individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information as a reference point for decision-making. In the context of liquidity, investors may anchor their perceptions of value based on past experiences with highly liquid assets. This can lead them to undervalue less liquid investments without fully considering their potential long-term returns.  Overall, psychology has a significant role in shaping how investors perceive and value liquidity in financial markets. Loss aversion, herd behavior, availability bias, and anchoring bias all contribute to the preference for liquidity and the willingness to pay a premium for it.  Understanding these psychological factors is crucial for both investors and policymakers alike. Investors can make more informed decisions by being aware of their biases and taking a long-term perspective on illiquid investments. Policymakers can design regulations that address the needs of market participants while also encouraging efficient allocation of capital across different asset classes.  In conclusion, while there is a rational economic argument behind the existence of a liquidity premium in financial markets, psychology has shown us that investor behavior plays a significant role as well. The desire for security and control, fear of losses during downturns, herd behavior driven by social cues, availability bias from recent experiences with easily accessible funds – all these psychological factors contribute to why people are willing to pay more for liquidity in stocks and other assets. By understanding these cognitive biases and behaviors, we can have better insights into how markets operate and make wiser investment choices that align our financial goals with sound principles derived from both economics and psychology.",continue
"music exists is so that it can be felt and experienced on a deep emotional level.  One individual who is particularly passionate about advocating for contemporary music is Ralph van Raat, an acclaimed pianist known for his extraordinary interpretations of 20th and 21st-century repertoire. Van Raat has dedicated his career to showcasing the immense beauty and diversity of contemporary music, challenging the common misconceptions surrounding it.  Van Raat firmly believes that contemporary music resonates with our lives in a profound way. Unlike classical compositions from centuries past, this genre speaks directly to our present experiences. Composers use contemporary music as a vessel to communicate their own personal encounters with the world around them. Thus, listeners are presented with an opportunity to connect with these artistic expressions on a universal level.  Contrary to popular belief, van Raat argues that contemporary music does not require restless intellectual analysis to understand or appreciate it. On the contrary, he asserts that its essence lies in its ability to evoke powerful emotions within listeners. Contemporary composers employ a wide array of techniques and influences from different musical traditions to create unique sonic landscapes that touch upon various aspects of the human condition.  Furthermore, van Raat emphasizes that we need not approach this genre as though we were attending an academic lecture or engaging in an intellectual exercise. Instead, he urges us to surrender ourselves completely and allow the music to wash over us without any preconceived notions or judgments. By approaching it with open hearts and minds, we can truly experience its power firsthand.  Van Raat's passion for contemporary music is evident through his performances on stage. His interpretations go beyond mere technical mastery; they breathe life into each note while revealing the immense emotional depth present within these modern compositions. He understands the intention behind each piece intimately - both intellectually and emotionally - which allows him to transmit their essence directly into the hearts of his audience members.  Through collaborations with numerous composers such as John Adams, Thomas Adès, and Magnus Lindberg, van Raat has also actively contributed to the creation of contemporary music by premiering new works specifically written for him. By engaging in these collaborations, he recognizes the importance of perpetually nurturing and evolving the genre.  Beyond performances and collaborations, van Raat is an advocate for contemporary music education. He understands that exposure is crucial to changing people's perceptions and encouraging active engagement with this often-neglected genre. As a professor at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam in the Netherlands, he imparts his knowledge and passion onto a new generation of musicians who are eager to explore contemporary compositions.  In conclusion, Ralph van Raat is not only a champion of contemporary music but also an ambassador for its accessibility and emotional depth. His unwavering belief in its ability to touch lives encourages us all to set aside preconceived notions and embark on a journey where we can discover beauty in unexpected places. Through his riveting performances, collaborations with composers, and dedication to education, he continues to break down barriers surrounding this genre – transforming it from something misunderstood into a captivating art form that speaks directly to our souls.",continue
"potential exit of Ireland from the EU-IMF bailout is indeed a significant step towards the country's economic recovery. The bailout, which was necessary to recapitalize its struggling banks in 2010, had placed Ireland under strict austerity measures and intensive financial supervision. However, with improved economic stability and growing investor confidence, experts are now optimistic about Ireland's ability to weather tough economic conditions on its own.  One of the key factors contributing to Ireland's success in restoring its economy lies in its rehabilitation by international capital markets. As investor trust returns, foreign direct investment has been pouring into the country. This influx of capital has not only created job opportunities but also strengthened various sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals, and financial services.  Moreover, the resilience that Ireland demonstrated during the European sovereign debt crisis has not gone unnoticed. Despite facing severe challenges that threatened its banking system and fiscal stability, Ireland managed to implement effective reforms and regain competitiveness. This favorable track record has garnered positive attention from both investors and international institutions.  Looking ahead, it is essential for Ireland to maintain this momentum by effectively managing potential risks related to Brexit. Being one of the countries most affected by Britain's departure from the EU due to strong trade ties between them makes it crucial for Irish policymakers to proactively assess these vulnerabilities and adopt appropriate contingency plans.  Another factor that contributes significantly to Ireland's post-bailout prospects is increased access to financing at lower costs. A testament to this improvement can be seen through declining borrowing rates on government bonds since 2012 when they hit their peak during the height of the crisis. Today, these interest rates are at historic lows due largely in part because of market recognition regarding reform efforts undertaken by successive Irish governments.  Credit Suisse's Neville Hill questioned whether an exit from bailout programs would have a severe impact on countries like Spain and Ireland where bank bailouts have already taken place—suggesting a possible divergence between prior expectations versus reality regarding post-bailout dynamics. This divergence indicates that the impacts of a country's exit from a bailout program may not be as severe as initially predicted.  Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that while Ireland has made significant progress, there are still challenges to overcome. The issue of public debt remains a concern, and the government must continue its efforts to reduce this burden further. Domestic demand also needs to improve to ensure sustained economic growth and reduce vulnerabilities in exports.  In conclusion, Ireland's potential exit from the EU-IMF bailout marks an important milestone in its journey towards economic stability and recovery. The rehabilitation by international capital markets, along with improved investor confidence and access to financing at lower costs, has set the stage for continued prosperity. However, policymakers must remain vigilant in managing potential risks and addressing ongoing challenges on the path towards long-term sustainability. With perseverance and effective implementation of reforms, Ireland can confidently assert that ""The Bonds are Back in Town,"" signaling its re-emergence as a resilient player on the global economic stage.",continue
"significantly. The Bank of England has implemented various measures to stabilize the economy, such as cutting interest rates and purchasing government bonds, which should mitigate some of the negative impacts.  However, it is important to recognize that the consequences of Brexit will not be limited to the UK alone. The decision has sent shockwaves throughout Europe and will undoubtedly have spillover effects on the global economy as well.  One immediate impact is on trade. The EU is one of the UK's largest trading partners, accounting for about 45% of its exports and 53% of its imports. With Brexit, new trade agreements need to be negotiated, which will take time and could potentially disrupt supply chains. This uncertainty in trade relations will not only affect businesses in the UK but also those across Europe who rely on a smooth flow of goods and services with their British counterparts.  The financial sector also faces potential challenges. London has long been a financial hub within Europe, hosting many multinational banks and providing services to clients across borders. With Brexit, there may be changes in regulations governing financial activities between the UK and EU member states. Companies could face increased costs associated with compliance or even relocation decisions if access to European markets becomes more difficult.  Investment flows are another area where spillovers are likely to occur. Uncertainty surrounding future economic relationships between Britain and Europe may lead investors to divert their funds away from both regions until clarity emerges. This decreased investment activity can have a dampening effect on economic growth not only in Britain but also in neighboring countries that rely heavily on foreign investments.  Furthermore, Brexit has elevated political risk across Europe as populist movements gain momentum with hopes for similar referendums or demands for concessions from Brussels. This heightened instability weakens investor confidence in European markets overall, making it more challenging for businesses throughout the continent to attract capital.  Countries like Ireland are particularly vulnerable due to their close economic ties with the UK through trade, investment flows, and border issues. The prospect of a ""hard"" border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) poses significant challenges for businesses operating across both sides.  In summary, while Brexit will undoubtedly have significant implications for the United Kingdom, its impact will extend well beyond its borders. The global economy will experience spillover effects through trade disruptions, financial sector challenges, decreased investment flows, and elevated political risk in Europe. Governments and businesses worldwide should closely monitor these developments to adapt their strategies accordingly.  It is worth noting that uncertainties persist around Brexit as negotiations continue between the UK and the EU on various aspects such as trade agreements, regulatory frameworks, immigration policies, and security cooperation. Only time will reveal how these negotiations unfold and shape the future relationships between Britain, Europe, and the rest of the world. The global economic spillovers of Brexit can already be observed in the financial markets. After the referendum in 2016, there was a sharp decline in global stock markets and increased volatility as investors tried to assess the implications of this historic decision. Currencies, particularly the British pound, experienced significant fluctuations, impacting international trade and investment.  The consequences of Brexit on the European Union itself should not be underestimated. The EU will lose one of its largest contributors to its budget with the departure of the UK. This loss will either require other member states to increase their contributions or necessitate cuts in EU programs and spending. Moreover, Brexit has exposed some underlying divisions within Europe concerning issues such as sovereignty, immigration policies, and economic integration.  Countries within Europe that heavily rely on tourism may also feel an impact due to changes in travel regulations between Britain and EU member states. The ease with which tourists can travel across borders may be affected by new visa requirements or immigration controls put in place after Brexit.  Another area where spillover effects may be felt is in research and development (R&D) collaborations between British universities/institutions and those from other European countries under EU funding programs like Horizon 2020. The uncertainty surrounding access to these programs could hamper scientific collaborations and ultimately slow down technological advancement throughout Europe.  Additionally, multinational companies that have used London as a gateway to both European markets and global talent pools might consider relocating some operations elsewhere within the EU if barriers arise due to post-Brexit agreements.  Although there are undoubtedly challenges ahead for both Britain and Europe as they navigate through this transition period, it is essential not only to focus on risks but also potential opportunities that may arise from new trade agreements enabling different regions around the globe to strengthen their ties with Britain outside of traditional European channels.  For example, countries like Australia, Canada, New Zealand have expressed interest in striking comprehensive free trade agreements with Britain post-Brexit. These discussions could potentially open up new markets and create valuable economic opportunities for the UK.  Overall, while the immediate impact of Brexit is understandably centered on the UK, it is crucial to recognize that this decision will reverberate throughout Europe and have spillover effects on the global economy. As negotiations progress and both sides adapt to a new reality, policymakers must remain vigilant in monitoring these effects and implementing measures to minimize potential disruptions. The Brexit journey is far from over, and it will require collaboration among nations to ensure a smooth transition that minimizes adverse consequences while seizing upon potential opportunities for economic growth.",continue
"consumer demand. The decline in nominal sector sales was mainly driven by the non-food retail segment, which saw a significant decrease in consumer spending. This decline can be attributed to various factors such as the strong Swiss franc, an increase in online shopping, and changing consumer preferences.  One of the major challenges faced by retailers in 2016 was the impact of the strong Swiss franc. Following the abandonment of the EUR/CHF exchange rate floor by the Swiss National Bank in January 2015, the value of the Swiss franc increased significantly. This made imported goods more expensive for consumers and affected their purchasing power. As a result, many consumers turned to online shopping platforms to find cheaper alternatives.  The rise of e-commerce has been another contributing factor to the decline in traditional retail sales. With convenient access to a wide range of products and competitive prices, online retailers have gained popularity among Swiss consumers. This trend has put additional pressure on brick-and-mortar stores as they struggle to compete with virtual platforms.  Changing consumer preferences have also played a role in shaping market dynamics within the retail sector. In recent years, there has been a shift towards lifestyle-oriented products and experiences rather than material possessions. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing experiences such as dining out or traveling over buying physical goods like clothing or electronics. This change in behavior has affected several segments within non-food retail, particularly those selling fashion items and electronics.  Despite these challenges, some sectors within the retail industry managed to perform well in 2016. Food retailers experienced slight growth in nominal sales due to stable demand for essential goods such as groceries and household supplies. However, even this segment faced pressures from changing consumer behaviors with an increasing preference for organic and locally produced food products.  Looking ahead into 2017, there are signs that indicate improvements for Switzerland's retail sector but also continued challenges that need attention from industry players. Economic forecasts suggest modest growth rates for both GDP and household income which could potentially lead to an increase in consumer spending. Additionally, the depreciation of the Swiss franc against other currencies could make imported goods more affordable and boost sales in certain segments.  However, retailers need to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and preferences in order to remain competitive. Embracing e-commerce and omnichannel strategies is crucial for brick-and-mortar stores as online shopping continues to gain popularity. Retailers can no longer rely solely on their physical presence but must also establish a strong online presence that offers convenience, competitive pricing, and personalized experiences.  Furthermore, focusing on customer experience will be essential for retailers looking to thrive in 2017. Offering unique experiences through personalized interactions, exclusive events, and innovative store designs can help attract consumers who are seeking more than just products.  In conclusion, the Swiss retail sector experienced a challenging year in 2016 with declines in nominal sales driven by changes in consumer behavior, the impact of the strong Swiss franc, and increased competition from online platforms. However, there are opportunities for growth moving forward if retailers embrace digital transformation strategies and focus on delivering exceptional customer experiences. By adapting to these shifts in the retail landscape while prioritizing consumer needs, Swiss retailers can navigate through this period of upheaval successfully",continue
"has also been attracting attention for its young and highly educated workforce, with English proficiency being a key advantage in the global outsourcing industry.  One of the major factors driving growth in the Philippines is its increasing presence in the outsourcing sector. The country has emerged as one of the world's top destinations for business process outsourcing (BPO), including customer service, IT support, and back-office operations. With a large pool of skilled workers who can communicate effectively in English, many multinational companies are choosing to set up their BPO centers in cities like Manila and Cebu. This has resulted in a surge of foreign investments flowing into the country and a booming BPO industry that contributes significantly to economic growth.  In addition to outsourcing, other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and construction are also experiencing significant expansion. The government's infrastructure development programs have led to an increase in construction activities across the country. Major projects such as new airports, highways, railways, and commercial buildings are being constructed to cater to rising demand. These investments not only boost economic growth but also create jobs for thousands of Filipinos.  Tourism is another area where the Philippines has great potential for growth. Blessed with stunning natural landscapes including pristine beaches, lush mountainsides, and vibrant coral reefs – it is no surprise that more tourists are discovering this tropical paradise. The government's efforts to improve tourism infrastructure and promote tourist attractions have started paying off with an increase in visitor arrivals year after year.  Political stability has also played a crucial role in attracting investors' confidence towards the Philippines.

"clothing tags. This technology allows retailers to track inventory accurately, reduce theft, and provide customers with a personalized shopping experience.  However, the digitalization of fashion goes far beyond RFID chips. The rapid advancements in technology have transformed the way we shop for clothes and how fashion brands interact with consumers.  One significant aspect is online shopping. E-commerce has revolutionized the retail industry by offering convenience, endless options, and easy price comparison. Today, consumers can browse through a vast range of clothing items from various brands at any time of the day without leaving their homes. This has not only expanded the customer base for fashion brands but has also enabled small independent designers to reach global audiences.

By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, fashion brands can create tailored marketing campaigns that appeal directly to their target audience.  Furthermore, social media platforms have become powerful tools for both fashion influencers and brands alike. Influencers with large followings can now collaborate with designers or retailers to showcase new collections or promote specific products directly to their audience through engaging content such as photoshoots or live videos.  On the other hand, social media enables fashion brands to connect directly with consumers in real-time by sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses into their creative process or hosting interactive Q&A sessions online. This not only humanizes these companies but also establishes trust and fosters brand loyalty among customers.  The rise of digitalization has also prompted sustainability efforts within the fashion industry. With greater awareness of the environmental impact of fast fashion, consumers are demanding more transparency and responsible practices from brands. Technological advancements provide tools to address this demand. For example, blockchain technology can enable supply chain transparency by tracking every step in the manufacturing process and ensuring ethical production practices.  Additionally, digitalization has given rise to the concept of rental and subscription-based fashion services. Instead of owning clothes outright, consumers can borrow or rent garments for a specific period, reducing waste and promoting a circular economy model.  In conclusion, digitalization is transforming fashion in numerous ways – from online shopping to virtual try-on experiences, artificial intelligence algorithms for personalized recommendations to social media platforms as marketing channels. Furthermore, sustainability efforts are being propelled by technological advancements such as blockchain supply chain tracking and rental subscriptions. The future of fashion lies in embracing these digitized trends while continually adapting to meet consumer demands through highly personalized experiences that foster sustainability and ethical practices within the industry .  Another significant impact of digitalization in fashion is the rise of influencer collaborations and social commerce. With the growing power of social media platforms, fashion brands now have a direct line to their target audience through influencers who have built loyal communities. By partnering with influencers, brands can tap into their followers' trust and credibility to promote their products. This has transformed the traditional way of brand advertising, as consumers are more likely to trust recommendations from someone they follow and relate to.  Additionally, social commerce has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook have integrated shopping features that allow users to make purchases directly within the app. This seamless integration between browsing and buying further enhances the convenience factor for consumers, leading to more impulse purchases and increased sales for fashion brands.  Furthermore, data collection and analysis play a crucial role in understanding customer preferences, market trends, and optimizing supply chains in the digital age. Brands can analyze customer data from online activities, such as browsing behavior, purchase history, and social media interactions to gain insights into consumer demands. With this information at hand, companies can tailor their marketing strategies accordingly by developing targeted ad campaigns or creating personalized product offerings.  Moreover, 3D printing technology is starting to disrupt traditional manufacturing processes in fashion. It offers designers greater flexibility in creating intricate designs while reducing waste generated during production. 3D printed clothing also allows for customization based on individual body measurements – leading to better-fitting garments that cater specifically to each customer's unique shape.  However exciting these advancements may be for both consumers and businesses alike - it is essential not to overlook potential challenges that come with digitalization in fashion. One concern revolves around issues of privacy as technological innovations gather vast amounts of personal data from individuals' online activities. Striking a balance between personalized experiences while respecting customers' privacy rights will be vital moving forward.  Moreover - accessibility remains a concern when it comes down solely relying on digital platforms for purchasing clothes. Not everyone has seamless access to the internet or digital devices, making it essential for fashion brands to consider multiple distribution channels. A hybrid approach that encompasses both online and physical retail experiences can ensure inclusivity while embracing digitalization.  In conclusion, the impact of digitalization on fashion and shopping is profound. From online shopping and virtual try-on experiences to AI algorithms and social media collaborations, technology is revolutionizing every aspect of the industry. With sustainability efforts becoming a top priority, blockchain technology and rental subscriptions are further shaping the future of fashion. Ultimately, as technology continues to evolve rapidly, staying adaptable and embracing innovation will be crucial for fashion brands to thrive in this digitized era.",continue
"Looking ahead, the Swiss economy is poised to continue its strong performance and maintain its resilience in the face of potential challenges. The country's clear orientation towards the pharmaceuticals industry has proven to be a wise choice, as it has not only shielded Switzerland from the worst effects of the global economic downturn but also positioned it for future growth.

However, it's worth noting that no economy can completely insulate itself from external shocks. As such, any potential disruptions in international trade or changes in consumer behavior could still pose challenges for Switzerland's export-dependent industries.  Fortunately, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been proactive in implementing monetary policy safeguards to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuations. One such example is maintaining a lower limit on the euro exchange rate - a strategy that has proved effective during times of uncertainty and volatility in global markets.  In addition to these structural factors supporting economic resilience, more favorable pricing conditions driven by low interest rates have supplied additional purchasing power within Switzerland. This boost in consumer spending can further contribute to domestic sales growth across various sectors of the economy.  Furthermore, Switzerland benefits from brisk immigration rates due to its attractive business environment and high standard of living. The influx of skilled workers helps fill labor market gaps while stimulating consumption through increased spending power. This trend is expected to continue as Switzerland remains an attractive destination for foreign talent and investments.  In terms of challenges, Switzerland must navigate geopolitical uncertainty and potential shifts in global trade dynamics. Rising protectionist sentiments and trade tensions between major economies could impact export-driven industries. Moreover, adjusting to new regulatory frameworks, such as Brexit-related changes in the European Union (EU), could require adaptability from Swiss businesses.  Nevertheless, Switzerland has consistently demonstrated its ability to adapt and innovate in the face of challenges throughout its history. The country's commitment to research and development, emphasis on high-quality products, stability in monetary policy, and strong institutions position it well for continued success.

However, when looking at the long-term potential, emerging markets still hold a strong appeal for investors.  One of the main drivers of growth in emerging markets is their expanding middle class. As incomes rise in these regions, more individuals are able to afford discretionary purchases and improve their standard of living. This increase in consumer spending presents a significant opportunity for companies operating in these markets. Many multinational corporations have recognized this potential and have been actively investing in emerging economies.  Furthermore, emerging markets often benefit from demographic advantages compared to developed regions. These countries typically have younger populations with growing numbers of working-age citizens.

"difficulties in communication have also led to some of the most valuable lessons and growth opportunities for me.  Coming from a wealthy family, I never really had to worry about money. It was always there, readily available to fulfill any material desire. But as I grew older and became more involved in my family's business, I realized that wealth alone is not enough. There is a deeper meaning that lies beyond the power of money.  It was during one of these events that I met Mariam, a young woman who had founded her own nonprofit organization dedicated to providing education and resources for underprivileged children. Her passion and dedication were contagious as she shared her experiences with me. This encounter opened my eyes to the real impact one can make in the lives of others by using their resources for good.  Inspired by Mariam's work, I decided to start my own philanthropic initiative within our family business. This meant diverting some of our financial resources away from personal luxuries and towards social causes. At first, it was difficult for my family members to understand why I wanted to do this when we already had everything we needed. But as they saw the positive changes it brought about in the lives of others, they too began recognizing its value.  The process required sacrifice – sacrifices not only from me but also from those around me who had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle. We had to let go of extravagant vacations and luxury items so that we could invest more into charitable projects and support organizations committed to making a difference.  But it wasn't just financial sacrifices; there were emotional ones too. Sometimes it meant missing out on personal events or spending less time with loved ones because my commitments demanded attention elsewhere. However, these sacrifices served as reminders that true fulfillment comes from contributing positively towards society rather than personal indulgence.  Through this journey of sacrifice, I have come face-to-face with various challenges that have helped shape my perspective on life and communication. The differences in values between the West and China have often posed obstacles in understanding and working together effectively. But I have learned that these challenges stem from ignorance and lack of exposure.  To bridge this gap, I immersed myself in diverse communities, studying different cultures, languages, and belief systems. This allowed me to gain a broader understanding of people's motivations and aspirations around the world. It also taught me that empathy is a powerful tool for effective communication.  By making sacrifices to step outside my comfort zone and embrace new experiences, I have been able to establish connections with people from all walks of life. These interactions have opened up new opportunities for collaboration and growth while also breaking down cultural barriers.  In retrospect, the gift lies not just in the sacrifices but also in the willingness to learn from them. Making compromises has enabled me to develop a greater sense of purpose beyond material wealth. It has given me a platform to connect with like-minded individuals who share a common goal – creating positive change.  So while it may be tempting to default towards personal comfort and luxury, sometimes sacrificing those things can lead us towards true fulfillment and make way for unforeseen gifts disguised along our journey. As we strip away the excesses that distract us from what truly matters, we find ourselves more aligned with our passions, values, and ultimately giving back meaningfully to society.  In conclusion, making sacrifices may initially seem challenging or burdensome; however it is these very sacrifices that provide us with opportunities for growth - both personally and professionally - as well as deeper connections with others. By shifting our focus away from purely material wealth towards making meaningful contributions to society, we unlock the potential for true fulfillment.""",continue
"its production process and quickly respond to customers' changing tastes. This has enabled the brand to maintain a constant flow of new, trendy designs on its racks.  So, how exactly do these fashion companies manage their supply chains so effectively? The answer lies in their unique business models. Traditional fashion companies would design their collections months in advance, placing large orders with manufacturers overseas. This meant that by the time the clothes reached the stores, it was uncertain whether they would still be in style or if consumer preferences had shifted.  Zara revolutionized this approach by implementing a fast fashion strategy. Instead of relying on long lead times for sourcing and production, Zara operates with a vertically integrated supply chain that allows them to control every step of the process – from design and manufacturing to distribution and retailing. By keeping most of its production in-house or closeby through local suppliers in Spain and Portugal, Zara can react swiftly to market demands.  The rapid pace at which Zara introduces new styles is staggering. While traditional brands may release two collections per year (spring/summer and fall/winter), Zara rolls out new designs every few weeks! This ensures that shoppers always find something fresh whenever they step foot into a Zara store.  Another key factor behind these fashion companies' success is their ability to analyze consumer data effectively. By leveraging technology and gathering insights from sales records, social media trends, and customer feedback, they understand what customers want even before they do themselves. This agile approach enables them to make informed decisions about what products should be produced more or less while minimizing waste.  In contrast, we have seen some well-established brands struggle due to an outdated mindset focused solely on maintaining exclusivity rather than understanding what consumers truly desire. These brands often rely too heavily on seasonal collections planned months ahead without considering customer feedback or current trends.  Additionally, many traditional fashion companies face challenges such as excessive inventory levels resulting from incorrect forecasting or unwillingness to take risks. These factors can lead to significant financial losses, causing them to lose their competitive edge and ultimately fade into obscurity.  Furthermore, the rise of e-commerce and online fast fashion giants like ASOS and Boohoo has intensified competition in the fashion industry. These companies have mastered omnichannel retailing, seamlessly integrating brick-and-mortar stores with online platforms. This strategy caters to today's tech-savvy consumers who expect a seamless shopping experience across all channels.  However, as with any industry, the rise of these fashion companies is not without its downsides. The fast fashion business model has received criticism for its negative impact on the environment and exploitative labor practices in some cases. By continually producing cheap clothing at such high volumes, these brands contribute to waste pollution and harm workers' rights in certain supply chain segments.  In conclusion, the success or failure of fashion companies depends heavily on their ability to adapt quickly to changing consumer preferences through an efficient supply chain. The rise of brands like Zara and H&M showcases how agile strategies can revolutionize an entire industry by providing continuous newness and value for customers. However, maintaining sustainability should also be a priority within this dynamic environment – finding a balance between speed-to-market and responsible practices is crucial for future success in the ever-evolving world of fashion.",continue

With the right support from policymakers,  continued investments,  and collaborations between industry players,  Australia has an opportunity to become a global leader in technology-driven innovation  and secure its economic future beyond the mining boom",continue
"outlook for other countries could also be affected. The repercussions of the Brexit decision are still unfolding, and the full extent of its impact remains uncertain.  In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, financial markets experienced significant volatility. Stock markets plummeted, and the British pound fell to its lowest level in decades. This indicates a loss of investor confidence and raises concerns about future investments in the UK. Many businesses are now reevaluating their plans and considering alternative locations within or outside Europe.  The uncertainty surrounding future trade arrangements between the UK and EU is another key factor contributing to an overall hazy outlook. The EU is a major trading partner for many countries around the world, and any disruption in this relationship would have far-reaching consequences. Negotiations on a new trade deal will likely be complex and protracted, adding further uncertainty to global economic prospects.  The ramifications extend beyond just economic considerations. The Brexit vote has ignited concerns about political stability across Europe, particularly in regards to anti-establishment sentiment gaining traction among other member states. This has heightened fears regarding further fragmentation within both Europe's political landscape as well as its unity on key policies.  Furthermore, rising global risks exacerbate the already uncertain economic climate brought on by Brexit. Geopolitical tensions are escalating in various regions such as Asia-Pacific with North Korea's nuclear ambitions presenting additional threats to global stability. Trade wars between major economies like China and the United States also loom large over international commerce.  As central banks around the world respond to these heightened uncertainties by signaling a more dovish stance on monetary policy, it becomes increasingly clear that growth expectations need to be revised downwards globally . Lower growth projections also come hand-in-hand with diminished inflation pressures , which may prompt central banks to pursue accommodative monetary policies such as interest rate cuts or more bond-buying programs.  In this context, it is crucial for policymakers and governments worldwide to adopt measures that enhance resilience against potential shocks arising from geopolitical risks and economic uncertainties. This includes investing in infrastructure to boost productivity, diversifying export markets, and strengthening financial regulations to prevent vulnerabilities from escalating into crises.  Despite the challenging circumstances that lie ahead, it is important to recognize that uncertainty can also create opportunities for innovation and change. The response of governments, businesses, and individuals will be critical in determining how successfully economies navigate through this transitional period. Cooperation on a global level will be imperative to address interconnected challenges and minimize the negative impact on growth prospects.  In conclusion, the UK's decision to leave the EU has significantly increased uncertainty not only for itself but also for many other economies around the world. The consequences of Brexit are still unfolding, with growth expectations being revised downwards across various countries. Rising global risks further compound these uncertainties, requiring prudent policy actions and international cooperation.

One of the key lessons I have learned throughout these experiences is that a successful urban transport system is not just about building infrastructure, but also about careful planning, coordination, and integration. It requires a holistic approach that takes into account the needs of different modes of transport, as well as the diverse range of people using those modes.  First and foremost, efficient public transportation is essential for keeping cities moving. In many cities around the world, private car ownership has skyrocketed over recent decades, leading to congested roads and increased air pollution. This reliance on cars not only hampers mobility but also has detrimental effects on public health and the environment. By investing in reliable public transportation systems like bus rapid transit (BRT), light rail transit (LRT), or subway networks, cities can provide residents with viable alternatives to driving alone.  However, simply building new public transportation lines is not enough; they must be integrated into a larger network that considers other modes of transport. Coordination between buses, trains, trams, bicycles lanes and pedestrian paths is critical to ensure seamless connections for commuters. For example , allowing buses or trams priority at intersections can dramatically reduce travel times by minimizing traffic delays.  Additionally , integrating technology into urban transport systems can greatly improve efficiency . Real-time information on bus or train schedules helps travelers plan their journeys more effectively , reducing waiting times at stops . Similarly , smart traffic management systems can adjust signals based on actual traffic conditions to optimize flow .  Another important aspect often overlooked in planning urban transport networks are non-motorized forms of mobility such as walking and cycling . Promoting active modes of transport not only reduces congestion but also leads to healthier communities by increasing physical activity levels . Designing bike lanes separated from vehicle traffic , installing bike-sharing programs , creating pedestrian-friendly spaces with wide sidewalks - these are all measures that make walking or cycling more attractive and safe options for urban dwellers .  To make cities truly sustainable, transport systems must also prioritize environmental concerns . Investing in low-emission vehicles or electric buses can significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions . Furthermore , encouraging carpooling or ride-sharing services helps minimize the number of private cars on the road.  Finally , public participation and engagement are crucial for the success of any urban transport project. Residents must be involved in decision-making processes from an early stage to ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account. By actively engaging with communities, planners can identify local preferences and tailor solutions accordingly.  In conclusion, keeping cities moving requires a comprehensive approach to urban transport planning. Building efficient public transportation networks that integrate different modes, promote non-motorized mobility, harness technology, prioritize environmental sustainability , and involve residents in decision-making processes is key to creating livable cities where people can move easily and efficiently. With rapid urbanization taking place around the world, investing in sustainable urban transport is not just a necessity but a strategic opportunity to shape future cities for generations to come.",continue
"Portugal finds itself at a crossroads as the impact of strict budget cuts imposed by the EU-IMF aid package starts to take its toll. Unemployment remains high, and economic growth has been slow, leading to growing discontent among the Portuguese people. Large demonstrations have erupted across the country in recent months, reflecting the frustration and weariness felt by many.  In light of this challenging situation, analysts at Credit Suisse suggest that a credit line from European institutions might be a more viable solution for Portugal than another bail-out. Providing Portugal with this credit line would allow the country to regain some economic footing and gradually return to debt markets on its own terms.  The option of a credit line rather than another bail-out is crucial not only for Portugal's financial stability but also for preserving social harmony within the nation. The strict austerity measures imposed as part of previous bail-outs have taken a toll on the national psyche. The ongoing high unemployment rate coupled with sluggish growth has created an environment where frustration can boil over into widespread unrest.  If unrest intensifies in Portugal, it could spread throughout Europe, fueling further rebellion against austerity measures imposed by bail-out programs. The region is already grappling with rising populism and anti-European sentiment. Countries like Greece have seen massive protests and political upheaval due to similar economic challenges.  To avoid this potential domino effect of discontent spreading across Europe, European institutions must carefully consider providing Portugal with alternative solutions such as credit lines that strike a balance between fiscal discipline and enabling sustainable economic recovery.  However, finding this delicate equilibrium will not be easy. It requires cooperation from both sides: European institutions must provide support tailored to Portugal's unique circumstances while maintaining responsible lending practices; meanwhile, Portuguese policymakers need to implement necessary structural reforms that promote competitiveness and stimulate job creation.  It is essential for all parties involved to acknowledge that while budgetary discipline is vital for long-term sustainability, it should not come at the expense of social welfare and individual well-being. Striking the right balance is crucial to prevent further fragmentation within the European Union.  In this complex situation, Portugal also needs to leverage its strengths to chart a path forward. The country has significant potential in industries such as tourism, renewable energy, and information technology. Focusing on these sectors could help drive job creation and economic growth while reducing reliance on external assistance.  Furthermore, Portugal should explore partnerships with other European countries to foster innovation and knowledge-sharing. Collaborative efforts can lead to the development of new technologies, increased productivity, and enhanced competitiveness on a global scale.  Portugal's future at this crossroads hinges not only upon the decisions made by European institutions but also on its citizens' resilience and ability to adapt to changing circumstances. The challenges ahead are formidable; however, with careful planning, smart strategies, and unified support from both domestic and international actors, Portugal can surmount these obstacles and carve out a prosperous future for itself within Europe.  Portugal's government must also play a crucial role in navigating this crossroads. They must prioritize policies that foster inclusive growth and address the socio-economic disparities that have fueled public discontent. Investing in education and vocational training programs can bridge the skills gap, providing individuals with better job prospects and reducing unemployment rates.  Furthermore, the government should focus on promoting entrepreneurship and creating an environment conducive to small business development. Encouraging innovation and supporting startups can inject vitality into the economy, generating new job opportunities and driving economic growth.  In parallel, Portugal should also seek to diversify its trade partners beyond Europe. Strengthening ties with emerging markets such as Africa, Latin America, or Asia can open up new avenues for exports and attract foreign investment. This diversification strategy would not only reduce dependence on specific European economies but also contribute to Portugal's resilience in times of global economic volatility.  Additionally, an effective communication strategy is vital during these challenging times. The Portuguese government must openly engage with its citizens, addressing their concerns while explaining the need for certain fiscal policies. Building trust through transparent communication can help alleviate tensions within society and foster a sense of shared responsibility towards overcoming economic challenges.  As Portugal navigates this crossroads between financial stability and social unrest, it is important to remember that long-term solutions require collaboration at both national and supranational levels. The European Union must acknowledge the unique circumstances of each member state while maintaining a united front against broader economic challenges.  Support from European institutions combined with responsible governance at home can help Portugal regain control over its destiny by successfully striking a balance between fiscal discipline and social well-being.  In conclusion, Portugal stands at a critical juncture where careful decision-making will determine its future trajectory. By considering alternatives like credit lines instead of bailouts while focusing on structural reforms that promote competitiveness and sustainable growth; by leveraging strengths in strategic industries; by fostering international collaborations; by investing in education, vocational training, entrepreneurship; by diversifying trade partners; and by engaging in transparent communication with its citizens, Portugal can overcome the current challenges and pave the way towards a prosperous future. As both national and European actors unite in their efforts, Portugal has the potential to emerge stronger from this crossroads, setting an example for other nations facing similar dilemmas within the European Union.",continue
"because of its ongoing intervention in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the Swiss franc. This expansion of central bank balance sheets has led to heated debates about the potential risks and consequences.  Critics argue that such large balance sheets could lead to future inflationary pressures, as it would be challenging for central banks to unwind their positions without causing disruptions in financial markets. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential effect on currencies and exchange rates, as massive interventions can distort these markets.  Moreover, some critics contend that central banks have overstepped their traditional mandate by venturing into unconventional policies such as quantitative easing (QE) and negative interest rates. According to them, central banks should focus solely on price stability and monetary policy adjustments rather than intervening in specific industries or sectors of the economy.  While it is crucial to acknowledge these valid concerns, it is also essential to recognize that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Central banks were faced with an unprecedented crisis during the financial meltdown, where a complete collapse of the banking system was a real risk. In response, they had no choice but to resort to unconventional policies in order to prevent further economic turmoil.  Furthermore, centralized decision-making allows for swift action during emergencies when time is of the essence. The ability of central banks to act quickly and decisively played a significant role in avoiding a more severe recession or depression post-2008. By providing liquidity support, stabilizing financial markets through asset purchases (quantitative easing), and implementing forward guidance measures, central banks helped restore confidence in the economy and prevented a complete breakdown.  However, it is important not to become complacent with this success story. Central banks must remain vigilant and adapt their strategies as necessary while keeping an eye on potential risks down the road.  Rather than debating whether conventional or unconventional policies are better suited for these uncertain times; policymakers should focus on redefining clear objectives with regards to price stability and overall financial stability. This will ensure that central banks have a precise and effective course of action to follow in the future, regardless of economic circumstances.  Additionally, central banks must improve transparency and communication with the public. At times, their actions may seem opaque or difficult to understand for ordinary citizens. By providing clear justifications for their decisions and ongoing policies, central banks can enhance public trust and accountability.  Moreover, further research into developing alternative monetary tools is essential. Central banks need to explore ways to improve their ability to influence the economy beyond traditional interest rate adjustments. This could include employing macroprudential measures to address financial stability concerns or implementing targeted lending programs.  Lastly, coordination and cooperation among different central banks should be prioritized on a global scale. As we continue living in an interconnected world economy, shocks in one region can quickly spread across borders. To effectively manage such situations, international coordination among central banks becomes crucial for maintaining stability globally.  In conclusion, while the actions taken by central banks since the financial crisis have been controversial, they were necessary to prevent a more severe economic downturn. Instead of focusing on outdated formulas or conventional vs. unconventional approaches; policymakers should concentrate on redefining clear tasks for central banks that ensure price stability and overall financial stability with enhanced transparency and improved tools at their disposal. By doing so, we can lay the groundwork for a resilient and adaptable monetary system capable of addressing future challenges effectively",continue

Through platforms like Twitter or Facebook Messenger, customers can reach out for support or inquire about services quickly and conveniently. This enhances customer satisfaction by providing instant responses and personalized assistance.  Furthermore, the visibility provided by social media allows financial firms to strengthen their brand image. By creating engaging content and interactive campaigns on platforms like Instagram or LinkedIn, they can showcase thought leadership within the industry while building trust with their audience.  However, it's important for financial firms not only to embrace social media but also understand its risks. One major concern is reputation management as negative feedback or viral incidents can spread rapidly across platforms damaging a firm's brand image within minutes if not managed promptly.  Another risk is regulatory compliance as there are strict guidelines regarding what information can be shared publicly in the finance industry due to insider trading concerns. Financial institutions need robust compliance processes in place when utilizing social media for communication purposes.  Additionally , cyber threats pose a significant risk as social media platforms have become prime targets for hackers and scammers. Financial firms must invest in robust cybersecurity measures and educate their employees about the importance of privacy and data protection when using social media.  Despite these risks, financial firms cannot afford to ignore the power of social media. The potential benefits far outweigh the drawbacks if handled correctly. By leveraging social media's vast amount of data, financial institutions can make more informed decisions, create targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, build brand image, and even predict market trends.  In conclusion, financial firms should not only ""like"" but fully embrace social media in their operations. The advent of algorithms that analyze social media data presents an exciting opportunity for financial wonks to tap into big data produced by millions of users on popular platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

". This is because lack of sleep affects the brain's executive functions, which are responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and self-regulation.  When we don't get enough sleep, our prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain that governs these functions - becomes less active. It's like a tired guard that starts neglecting its duties and allows all sorts of impulsive thoughts and behaviors to slip through. Our ability to think critically and make sound judgments becomes compromised.  Studies have shown that when individuals are sleep-deprived, they are more likely to engage in risky behavior and make poor choices. This can range from simple everyday decisions like choosing unhealthy food options or delaying important tasks to more serious consequences such as impaired driving or financial mismanagement.  In fact, research has indicated that being awake for 17-19 hours straight has a similar impact on cognitive function as having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level of 0.05%. And staying awake for 24 hours straight is equivalent to having a BAC level of 0.10%, which is above the legal limit in many countries.  But it's not just about decision-making; lack of sleep also affects our emotional regulation. When we're sleep-deprived, we become more irritable, moody, and short-tempered. We are easily overwhelmed by stressors that would typically be manageable if we were well-rested.  Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to various physical health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and weakened immune system function. It also increases the risk of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety.  So why do people still underestimate the importance of getting sufficient sleep? One reason could be societal pressures that prioritize productivity over restorative rest. There seems to be an ongoing belief that sleeping less equates to working harder or accomplishing more in life.  This misconception needs addressing because prioritizing quality sleep doesn't mean being lazy or unproductive. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Getting enough sleep is crucial for enhancing cognitive performance, creativity, memory consolidation, and overall mental and physical well-being.  Fortunately, awareness about sleep science and its importance is growing. More research is being conducted on the topic, shedding light on how essential sleep is for our health and productivity.  In recent years, there has been a shift in workplace culture with some companies recognizing the value of well-rested employees. They are implementing policies that promote work-life balance, offering flexible working hours or designated nap spaces to allow workers to recharge during the day.  Additionally, individuals are becoming increasingly conscious about their own sleep habits and making efforts to prioritize healthy sleeping patterns. They are adopting relaxation techniques such as meditation or creating bedtime rituals that signal their brain it's time to wind down.  Education plays a crucial role in dispelling misconceptions surrounding sleep as well. By providing accurate information about the importance of adequate rest and explaining the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on physical and mental health, we can help people make informed choices regarding their lifestyle habits.  In conclusion, snoozing may not always mean losing if we understand and appreciate the significance of good quality sleep. Science has shown us that our brains remain actively engaged during slumber - consolidating memories and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. It's time we debunked outdated notions that equate lack of rest with productivity because ultimately ignoring our need for sufficient shut-eye leads us down a path of impaired decision-making, compromised emotional regulation, decreased cognitive function - putting both our mental and physical health at risk.sleep",continue
"happened - both Federer and Wawrinka officially overtook Rafael Nadal in the rankings, marking the first time that two Swiss players had been ranked higher than Nadal.   As the clay court season kicked off, all eyes were on Nadal as he typically dominated on this surface. It was expected that he would regain his form and climb back up the rankings. However, Federer and Wawrinka had other plans.   They continued to showcase their skills in each tournament they participated in. Wawrinka showed his resilience by reaching the finals of the Monte Carlo Masters, where he faced Federer for an epic showdown between two Swiss powerhouses.  The match lived up to its hype, with both players displaying incredible shot-making skills and mental fortitude. Eventually, it was Federer who emerged victorious, clinching his first-ever title at Monte Carlo and solidifying himself as a true contender on clay courts.  The win not only boosted Federer's confidence but also sent shockwaves throughout the tennis world - a new rivalry was brewing within Switzerland itself. The media dubbed it ""Fedrinka,"" combining their last names to represent this newfound partnership against the rest of the world.  Despite being fierce competitors on court, off-court they maintained a strong friendship that only fueled their desire to support each other's success. Their mutual respect was evident whenever they spoke about one another during interviews or press conferences.  Together they defied age expectations and persistently challenged younger opponents who were supposed to be dominating men's tennis at this stage in their careers. The constant comparisons between Team Switzerland (Federer/Wawrinka) vs Team NextGen (Young rising stars like Novak Djokovic or Andy Murray) reached fever pitch during major tournaments like Wimbledon or Roland Garros.  At Wimbledon 2014, both players again showcased their brilliance by reaching deep into tournament rounds against formidable opponents. It felt almost predestined that they would meet in the final, setting up a dream scenario for fans and spectators around the world.  As fate would have it, ""Fedrinka"" made it to the championship match. The intensity was palpable as both players fought for every point and displayed their full range of skills. It was Federer who ultimately triumphed, securing his seventh Wimbledon title.  The victory cemented ""Fedrinka's"" status as one of the greatest tennis partnerships of all time. Their synchronized success not only changed the landscape of Swiss tennis but also altered how doubles partners were viewed in a singles-dominated sport.  Moving forward from that unforgettable season, Federer and Wawrinka continued to excel on their individual paths while maintaining a shared bond as ambassadors for Swiss tennis worldwide. They pushed each other to greater heights during practice sessions and provided unwavering support on and off-court.  Although Federer's career has continued far beyond 2014, his partnership with Wawrinka during that season remains a quintessential moment in Swiss sporting history. Their synchronized rise up the rankings against formidable opponents served as an inspiration to aspiring athletes across Switzerland.  ""Fedrinka"" showcased not only exceptional talent but also emphasized teamwork, perseverance, and friendship - qualities that transcend their achievements on-court. Together they proved that when two individuals unite towards a common goal, they become an unstoppable force capable of taking on the rest of the world side by side.",continue
"cuts by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have also contributed to these historic lows.  The primary driver behind the low interest rates in Switzerland is the state of the global economy. The turmoil in Europe's financial markets has prompted investors to seek safe haven assets, with Swiss government bonds being a popular choice due to their reputation for stability. This increased demand for Swiss bonds has pushed their prices up and yields down, resulting in negative yields on short-term government bonds.  Furthermore, as an open economy heavily reliant on exports, Switzerland has felt the impact of global economic slowdowns and uncertainties. As a result, inflationary pressures have diminished significantly. The current inflation rate of -1 percent indicates deflationary tendencies in the Swiss economy. Deflation typically leads to lower interest rates as central banks attempt to stimulate lending and spending.  The SNB has played a crucial role in shaping Switzerland's interest rate landscape. It adopted negative interest rates back in 2014 as an unconventional monetary policy measure to fight deflationary pressures and prevent excessive appreciation of its currency, the Swiss franc. By charging banks for holding excess reserves at the central bank, the SNB encouraged them to lend more money into circulation rather than keeping it parked with them.  In addition to negative interest rates, another tool employed by the SNB is foreign exchange interventions. To prevent further strengthening of its currency and protect its export-driven economy from trade disadvantages, particularly against neighboring eurozone countries, Switzerland regularly intervenes in foreign exchange markets by purchasing foreign currencies such as euros or dollars.  While these measures have helped contain upward pressure on the Swiss franc's value and maintain price stability within Switzerland's borders, they also contribute to pushing down domestic interest rates even further due to increased liquidity injected into financial markets.  Investors seeking yield face significant challenges against this backdrop of historically low-interest rates and negative bond yields in Switzerland. Traditional fixed-income investments provide little income or even losses when adjusted for inflation. As a result, some investors have turned to riskier assets in search of higher returns. This has led to increased investment in stocks and real estate, fuelling concerns about potential bubbles forming.  The low-interest-rate environment has also affected savers and retirees who rely on interest income from their savings accounts or fixed-income investments. With yields near zero or negative, these individuals face difficulties in generating income to meet their financial obligations.  Importantly, the impact of low-interest rates is not limited to Switzerland alone. Central banks worldwide have implemented accommodative monetary policies with the aim of stimulating economic growth in the face of sluggish global demand and inflationary pressures. This synchronized approach has resulted in a race to the bottom for interest rates globally.  However, it's worth noting that there are some potential downsides to persistently low interest rates. Savers may be incentivized to take on excessive risks or reduce consumption as they struggle to generate sufficient returns from safe assets. Additionally, prolonged periods of low-interest rates can contribute to asset price inflation and potentially create imbalances within financial markets.  In conclusion, Switzerland's open economy and safe haven currency make it susceptible to international trends that influence its interest rate structure. The country's current historic lows can be attributed primarily to global economic uncertainties, deflationary pressures, negative interest rates set by the SNB, and increased demand for Swiss government bonds as a safe-haven asset. While these measures have helped stabilize prices and contain appreciation of the Swiss franc, they pose challenges for investors seeking yield and individuals relying on interest income from savings accounts or fixed-income investments",continue
"percent of the time for both. Given this information, what would you decide?  In this scenario, we are presented with a situation where a taxi was involved in an accident at night, and two cab companies, Green and Blue, operate in the city. We have two pieces of information to consider: firstly, 85 percent of the taxis are green and 15 percent are blue; secondly, a witness claims that the taxi involved in the accident was blue.  To make an informed decision in this case, we need to assess the evidence and probabilities accurately. Let's break down our options:  Option 1: The witness correctly identified the color. Considering that both companies' taxis have been accurately identified by this particular witness under similar light conditions 80 percent of the time while failing 20 percent of the time for both colors equally across board(II), if indeed their identification is accurate on this occasion as well (even considering the possibility for error), then it can be concluded with reasonable certainty that there is an actual probability that it is more likely than not (above a chance occurrence) for Option 1 to be true i.e., There is around an approximated probability greater than or equal to 80% (and perhaps slightly lower due to some margin of error) that if they say its blue then it really ought to be.  Option 2: The witness made an incorrect identification. Given all factors present here -- including considering option one above assuming everything else has been accounted for properly -- which suggests there might exist some chances few times outlying when even though each color failed equally up by just slightly less than or equal approximate about +20% points from being consistently correct overall over numerous tests according II hitherto tested record characteristics evaluated; suppose it might also appear relatively unlikely (yet still statistically possible) now not right view whats point numerically incumbent several contingency factors occupying other outside inducements learnt about circumstances behind reliability witnessed understand why or how this specific time would have been an incorrect identification compared to others?  Considering the above, it seems more probable that the witness was correct in identifying the taxi color as blue due to their consistent record of accurately identifying both colors under similar light conditions in previous tests. However, we should also acknowledge the possibility of a false positive or some error margin since human perception can be fallible.  Option 3: An alternative explanation exists. It is essential to consider if there could be any other factors at play that may provide an alternative explanation. For instance, were there any physical evidence at the accident scene that contradicted or corroborated the witness's claim? Were there any other witnesses who saw and identified the taxi involved? Analyzing all available information beyond just testimonial assertions by accounts involved could yield more insights about what actually transpired.  In conclusion, based on the information provided and considering probabilities, it is highly likely that Option 1 is true – namely, that a blue taxi was involved in the accident. However, we must be cautious of potential errors and allow for alternative explanations until all possible evidence has been examined thoroughly. Focusing solely on just one aspect such as witness testimony without considering other factors may not provide us with a complete picture of what transpired during this incident. It is important to conduct further investigations to gather more substantial evidence before reaching a final decision in this case.",continue
"of strategy, it is crucial for us to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our opponents. We have carefully studied each team in our group and formulated a plan to exploit their vulnerabilities while capitalizing on our own strengths.  One of the key aspects of our strategy is having a solid defensive line. We have identified that many teams rely heavily on attacking through the middle or utilizing fast wingers. To counter this, we will focus on organizing our backline and ensuring it remains compact. Our players will be well-drilled in maintaining their defensive positions, closing down spaces quickly, and intercepting any potential threats.  However, defense alone won't win us matches; we also need to have an effective attacking approach. For that reason, we have analyzed the playing styles of all potential opponents in order to find gaps in their defense that can be exploited by our forward line.  We believe in an offensive style of play with quick transitions from defense to attack. Our midfielders will play a crucial role in this regard as they will act as connectors between the defense and attack. They must possess excellent passing ability along with strong decision-making skills to ensure smooth transitions during counter-attacks.  Furthermore, set pieces can often prove decisive in tight matches; therefore, we have dedicated ample time during training sessions to perfecting them. Both offensively and defensively, we aim for precision and coordination during corner kicks or free-kicks.  Another important aspect of our strategy is mental preparation. Playing at such a high-profile tournament can sometimes lead to nerves or pressure affecting performance levels. That's why psychological conditioning plays a significant role in our team's preparations.  We have enlisted the help of sports psychologists who specialize in preparing athletes for high-pressure situations like World Cup matches. Through techniques such as visualization exercises and positive reinforcement practices, we aim to build resilient minds within the team - minds that are capable of remaining focused even when faced with adversity.  Lastly but certainly not least important is the unity and camaraderie among our players. We believe that a united team is a successful team. As such, we have organized team-building activities to foster relationships between the players both on and off the pitch.  These activities include group meals, bonding exercises, and trust-building exercises. The aim is to create an environment where everyone feels supported and motivated by their teammates. By fostering strong bonds within the team, we can enhance communication on the field and encourage teammates to work together towards a common goal.  In conclusion, our strategy for Brazil encompasses various elements such as defensive solidity, effective attacking play, set-piece mastery, mental preparation, and teamwork. By combining these aspects with our philosophy of working as a cohesive unit with a never-give-up mentality, we are confident in our ability to achieve success at the World Cup. We are excited for what lies ahead and look forward to showcasing our strategic approach on football's biggest stage of the World Cup. However, while we have developed a comprehensive strategy, it is important to remain adaptable and flexible during the tournament. Football has a way of throwing unexpected challenges and surprises our way, so we must be ready to adjust our tactics accordingly.  To ensure that we are always prepared for any situation, we have simulated different scenarios in training sessions. This involves practicing various formations and strategies that can be implemented based on the conditions of each match. Our players have been trained to quickly adapt to different game situations, making strategic changes on the fly if necessary.  Additionally, besides focusing on our own strategy, it is vital for us to study and analyze other teams throughout the tournament. We keep a close eye on their performances and strategies in order to identify any patterns or weaknesses that can be exploited when facing them.  Our team of strategists works tirelessly behind the scenes to gather information about our potential opponents' playing style, key players, and tactical approaches. This allows us to devise specific game plans for each match tailored towards neutralizing their strengths while capitalizing on their weaknesses.  However, as much as we value strategic planning and analysis off the pitch, we also emphasize empowering our players with freedom and creativity once they step onto the field. While adhering to an overall game plan is crucial for team cohesion during matches, allowing individual moments of brilliance can often make all the difference between victory and defeat.  We encourage our players not only to follow instructions but also trust their instincts when opportunities arise. Quick-thinking decision-making combined with technical skills can unlock even the most disciplined defenses or surprise opponents who may feel they have fully analyzed us beforehand.  At this summit of strategists leading up to Brazil's World Cup campaign , teamwork becomes more crucial than ever before . The success of implementing such a comprehensive strategy relies heavily upon effective communication among coaches , scouts , trainers , analysts , psychologists , nutritionists - basically every member of staff involved in preparing this team .  Through regular meetings, brainstorming sessions, and in-depth discussions, we ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to strategy. The input and insights from each person in our team create a collaborative atmosphere where collective intelligence can flourish.  Ultimately, the summit of strategists underlines our commitment to achieving success in Brazil. We believe that combining meticulous planning with adaptability, creativity, mental strength, and a strong sense of unity will be key factors in reaching our goals.  As Ottmar Hitzfeld , I am confident in the abilities and dedication of this team. Together with my staff and players , we are ready to face any challenges that lie ahead . The World Cup is not just about winning matches but also leaving a lasting impact through our cohesive strategy and memorable performances.  Brazil awaits us , filled with its rich footballing history . And as we take to the pitch , armed with our meticulously designed game plans combined with the passion burning inside every player's heart , we will strive to make history of our own - etching indelible memories of triumphs onto football's grandest stage .",continue
"number of Chinese consumers, luxury shopping has become a way to bond with loved ones and showcase their success. The rapid rise in China's middle class and the increasing wealth of its citizens have fueled a demand for luxury goods like never before.  As the economy boomed over the past few decades, so did the aspirations of Chinese consumers. Luxury brands seized this opportunity and flocked to China to tap into this lucrative market. The Super Brand Mall in Shanghai is just one example of how these brands have successfully established themselves in China's retail landscape.  Walking through the mall, one can see renowned names like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, and Chanel, among others. These luxury stores are beautifully designed with elaborate window displays that captivate passersby. Shoppers rush inside eagerly to peruse the latest collections and make their purchases.  However, it is not only about buying expensive items; it is also about receiving exceptional service and experiencing exclusivity. Luxury shoppers value personalized attention from salespeople who understand their tastes and preferences. They appreciate being able to try on limited edition pieces or accessories that might be hard to find elsewhere.  For many Chinese consumers, owning luxury goods is seen as a status symbol – an outward display of success and affluence. This desire for luxury items extends beyond personal use; it has become customary for people to gift luxury products at special occasions like weddings or birthdays.  The shift towards experiential shopping has been significant in recent years as well. Many high-end boutiques now offer immersive experiences within their stores – from art exhibitions to fashion shows or even gastronomic delights curated by celebrity chefs specifically for customers who are looking for more than just shopping but also an extraordinary experience.  Aside from physical stores, e-commerce platforms have played a massive role in satisfying China's thirst for luxury goods – especially during times like the COVID-19 pandemic when physical retail was temporarily shut down or restricted. Online platforms such as Tmall and JD.com have made luxury shopping accessible to a wider audience, even in remote areas of the country.  The Chinese millennial generation has also emerged as a key driver of luxury consumption. Young consumers are more tech-savvy and demonstrate a willingness to spend on high-quality products. They are drawn to luxury brands that align with their values, such as sustainability or social responsibility.  Despite China's great thirst for luxury, the market has not been without its challenges. Counterfeits remain a persistent issue, making it crucial for brands to protect their intellectual property rights and maintain brand integrity. Additionally, shifts in consumer behavior due to economic uncertainties or changes in fashion trends can impact sales.  Nonetheless, China's appetite for luxury shows no signs of slowing down. With an increasing number of affluent Chinese consumers demanding exclusive experiences and high-end products, global brands continue to invest heavily in China's market. Whether through physical stores or digital platforms, these brands understand the value of catering to China's discerning shoppers who see luxury not just as material possessions but a lifestyle choice that reflects their aspirations and achievements.

"will have profound consequences not only for the US economy, but also for the global markets and economies that rely heavily on American consumer spending.  The financial crisis of 2008 was a wake-up call to many countries around the world, highlighting the risks of relying too heavily on one country’s consumer base. As US consumers struggled to recover from the economic downturn, other countries realized they needed to diversify their export markets and find new consumers to sustain their own economic growth.  This realization led to a shift in focus towards emerging market economies. These economies, such as China, India, Brazil, and others in Southeast Asia and Latin America, were experiencing rapid economic growth and had a growing middle class hungry for goods and services. They became attractive targets for companies looking to expand into new markets.  This newfound attention from multinational corporations sparked an increase in investment in infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, and marketing campaigns in these emerging markets. Companies began tailoring their products specifically for these new consumers - adapting packaging designs, flavors or ingredients of food products , changing advertisements or even creating entirely new product lines based on local preferences.  For example, companies like Coca-Cola recognized that tastes varied across different cultures and diversified its product range accordingly. In China it launched green tea flavored Coke while offering chai masala (spiced tea) flavored Coke in India - all aimed at appealing directly to local tastes.  With more disposable income at hand due to increased employment opportunities in these emerging markets coupled with attractive financing options provided by banks eager for market share ,consumers were able to afford more imported goods – fueling increased trade flows between developed nations where most multinational corporations are headquartered .  As multinational corporations started seeing success entering into these new markets , they further expanded their operations by setting up additional production facilities within Emerging Market Economies themselves . This move ensured proximity between manufacturing units & end consumers bringing down pentransportation costs drastically along-with reduced delivery timelines .Sophisticated supply chain management & thorough analysis of consumer trends helped save costs associated with overproduction or insufficiently fulfilling market needs.  Furthermore, emerging market consumers have shown a preference for high-end luxury goods and services. They are willing to pay a premium for quality products and experiences, which has attracted brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz to establish a strong presence in these markets.  The shifting of economic power from the US consumer to the emerging market consumer has not only transformed global trade patterns but also geopolitical dynamics. With economic growth comes political influence, leading to increased negotiations and alliances between countries as they seek to secure favorable trade agreements and access new markets.  Ultimately, this transformation in the global economy has brought about positive changes by reducing dependency on one country’s consumer base. However, it is important for both companies and governments to recognize that emerging market consumers have unique preferences, cultures,and purchasing behaviors. Companies should continue their efforts in understanding these differences and adapting their strategies accordingly.  In conclusion ,while the reduction in US consumption may lead to short-term challenges for some countries heavily reliant on American demand,largely we are witnessing a more balanced global economy where new consumers are driving economic growth at a time when developed nations face demographic challenges & growing wage inequality .",continue
"The financial center in Switzerland has long been recognized as a cornerstone of the country's economy. Its significance is not just limited to the provision of banking services but goes far beyond that. Swiss banks have played a crucial role in ensuring stability, attracting foreign investment, and facilitating economic growth.  During times of economic uncertainty or crisis, the importance of the financial sector becomes even more apparent. The global financial meltdown in 2008 was an eye-opener for many countries, including Switzerland. While economies around the world were grappling with instability and recession, Swiss banks were able to weather the storm relatively well.  The resilience of Swiss banks during such challenging times highlighted their strength and value. Many international investors turned to Switzerland as a safe haven amid widespread financial turmoil. This influx of capital helped prop up not only the banking sector but also other industries in Switzerland that rely on foreign investment.  Moreover, Swiss banks provide critical support to businesses within the country by offering various financial services such as lending and financing options. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form a significant part of the Swiss economy, heavily depend on access to credit from these banks to fund their operations and expand their businesses.  The impact of these institutions on job creation cannot be overlooked either. The financial sector represents a substantial portion of employment opportunities in Switzerland, directly employing thousands of individuals who work within this industry. These jobs are highly sought after due to attractive salaries and benefits offered by banks.  However, despite its undeniable importance for economic prosperity, the Swiss financial center often finds itself subject to political scrutiny and public debate. The power wielded by some influential banking institutions has fueled concerns about potential abuses or excessive concentration of influence within this industry.  In recent years, efforts have been made both domestically and internationally to increase transparency and strengthen regulations governing these institutions' operations. Initiatives such as stricter anti-money laundering measures aim to curb illicit activities while maintaining trust in Swiss banking practices.  Furthermore, Switzerland has taken steps to diversify its financial center by promoting the development of fintech and innovation within the sector. This strategic approach not only ensures that Swiss banks remain competitive in a rapidly evolving global landscape but also creates opportunities for new players to enter the market, fostering healthy competition.  The ongoing commitment to upholding high standards of ethical conduct and responsible banking practices is crucial for maintaining Switzerland's reputation as a reliable and trustworthy financial hub. By continually adapting to changing dynamics and proactively addressing challenges, Swiss banks can ensure long-term stability and sustain their role as an essential pillar of the economy.  In conclusion, the financial center in Switzerland plays a vital role in driving economic growth, attracting investment, facilitating business activities, and creating employment opportunities. Its significance goes well beyond being just providers of banking services. The resilience demonstrated by Swiss banks during times of crisis underlines their critical importance to both domestic and international markets. However, balancing power with accountability remains an ongoing challenge that necessitates continuous efforts towards regulation and transparency. Ultimately, by effectively managing these challenges while embracing innovation and responsible practices, the Swiss financial center will continue to be a cornerstone of the country's economy for years to come.",continue
"and a chance for Medvedev to put his own stamp on Russia's economy.  Russia's economy has been experiencing strong growth over the past few years, largely driven by high oil prices, which has boosted government revenues and allowed for increased investment in infrastructure and industries. This positive trajectory is likely to continue under Medvedev's leadership, as he is expected to maintain the economic policies established by Putin.  One area where Medvedev may bring about some changes is in promoting diversification of Russia's economy. While the country has made significant progress in reducing its reliance on oil and gas exports, there is still work to be done. Medvedev could prioritize sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and agriculture to further strengthen the country's economic base.  Another aspect that may see some adjustments under Medvedev will be efforts to improve Russia's business climate. Despite its economic success, Russia has struggled with corruption and bureaucracy which have hindered foreign investment and business development. Medvedev has voiced his commitment to tackling these issues head-on and may introduce reforms aimed at streamlining processes and increasing transparency.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that Medvedev will prioritize social welfare programs as part of his agenda. Under Putin's tenure, there were significant improvements in healthcare services and education accessibility across the country. With continued economic growth providing ample resources, expanding social safety nets could be a key focus for the new president.  In terms of international relations impacting the economy, it remains uncertain how things will unfold under Medvedev’s leadership- particularly given ongoing tensions with Western countries over issues like Ukraine sanctions or allegations of election interference. However, maintaining stability within geopolitical dynamics will be crucial for ensuring sustained economic growth.  One challenge facing both Putin and Medvedev would be managing inflationary pressures amidst accelerated growth rates. As increased investment drives up demand within local markets- there are concerns about potential overheating risks that need careful monitoring from monetary authorities.  Overall, Russia's economy is poised to continue its upward trajectory under Medvedev's presidency. While there may be subtle changes in policies and approaches, the overall vision of a prosperous and diversified economy is expected to remain unchanged. As long as the government continues to focus on attracting foreign investment, promoting innovation, and addressing structural issues within the economic framework, Russia is likely to maintain its position as a major global player.  It will be intriguing to watch how Medvedev's leadership style evolves in the coming months. With Putin continuing to exert his influence behind the scenes, it remains uncertain how much autonomy Medvedev will have in shaping economic policies. Nonetheless, his presidency marks an opportunity for growth and development, both domestically and internationally. Only time will reveal the true impact he will have on steering Russia towards continued prosperity. One of the key factors that will determine Russia's economic future under Medvedev's leadership is the country's ability to attract foreign investment. While there have been successful efforts in recent years to improve the business environment, more work needs to be done in order to compete with other emerging economies. Medvedev's commitment to tackling corruption and bureaucracy will be crucial in removing barriers and instilling confidence among international investors.  Moreover, Medvedev may also focus on strengthening relationships with existing trade partners and exploring new opportunities for collaboration. Despite differences with Western countries, there are still avenues for cooperation with other nations, especially those within Asia and the Middle East. By diversifying its trading partnerships, Russia can mitigate risks associated with any potential disruptions from sanctions or political tensions.  Another area where Medvedev may seek change is in addressing youth unemployment and supporting entrepreneurship. By fostering an environment that encourages innovation and empowers young people, Russia can tap into its human capital potential and drive economic growth from within. This could involve investing in education programs that prioritize technological skills or implementing policies that incentivize small business development.  Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how Medvedev tackles environmental sustainability as part of his economic agenda. Climate change has become a pressing global issue, and ensuring sustainable development practices will not only benefit Russia but also improve its international standing as an environmentally conscious nation. Transitioning towards renewable energy sources and promoting green technologies could yield long-term economic benefits while addressing environmental concerns.  However, it is important to acknowledge that Russian economics does not exist within a vacuum; external factors such as global market trends or geopolitical events can significantly impact growth prospects. If oil prices fluctuate or if there are shifts in demand from major trading partners - including China or Europe - Russia may face challenges requiring adaptability from policymakers.  In conclusion, while continuity is expected under Medvedev's presidency regarding overall economic policies established by Putin – such as maintaining stability through infrastructural development and prudent fiscal management – there are areas where changes can be anticipated. Medvedev has the opportunity to address key issues such as diversification, foreign investment, corruption, and social welfare programs. By leveraging Russia's vast resources, enhancing its business climate, and promoting innovation and sustainability, Medvedev can build on the foundation laid by his predecessor for a brighter economic future. As the country navigates shifting geopolitical dynamics and global market conditions, it will require strategic leadership to ensure sustained growth and prosperity for all Russians.  Only time will tell how successful Medvedev will be in steering Russia towards its economic goals but with a strong track record of consistent growth in recent years coupled with strategic policy directions- optimism for Russia's future remains high.",continue

"new beginning for Bulgaria "", as expressed by Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev during the official ceremony celebrating the country's inclusion into the EU. The membership marked a significant turning point in Bulgaria's history, presenting new opportunities and challenges for its people.  One of the immediate benefits of joining the EU was increased access to European markets. Bulgarian companies now have easier access to export their goods and services to other member states, boosting trade and economic growth. Additionally, foreign investors are more drawn to Bulgaria due to its EU membership, resulting in increased investment inflows that support job creation and stimulate innovation.  The EU membership also meant that Bulgaria had to align itself with European standards and regulations across various sectors. This process required significant reforms in areas such as governance, justice system, human rights protection, and environmental sustainability. While these reforms were undoubtedly challenging, they ultimately contributed to strengthening democratic institutions in the country.  Furthermore, being part of the EU provided Bulgarian citizens with a range of opportunities related to education, employment, travel, and cultural exchange. Young Bulgarians now have greater access to study abroad programs within Europe through Erasmus+ or benefit from employment opportunities in other member states without any barriers or restrictions.  The inclusion into the EU also brought additional funding for various development projects within Bulgaria. Through programs like Cohesion Policy funds or Rural Development Funds provided by the European Union budget , investments were made in infrastructure development , agriculture modernization , environmental protection , and regional development initiatives . These funds have not only improved living standards but also helped bridge economic disparities between urban and rural areas .  However , alongside these positive changes , Bulgaria has faced several challenges after joining t he EU . One fundamental challenge has been tackling corruption effectively . Despite efforts at combating corruption with assistance from international partners like OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office), progress remains slow . A lack of transparency within government institutions combined with deep-rooted networks hinders effective measures against corrupt practices .  Another issue that Bulgaria had to address was the brain drain phenomenon. The country experienced a significant outflow of highly-educated individuals who sought better opportunities elsewhere in Europe or beyond. This has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of economic growth and innovation within Bulgaria.  Moreover, while EU membership did bring economic growth and increased living standards, some regions and social groups have not enjoyed the full benefits of this progress. Income inequality remains a challenge with persistent poverty rates in certain areas, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the Roma community.  Furthermore, joining the EU also meant adopting certain policies and regulations that may not always align with local traditions or priorities. This has caused some tensions and debates within Bulgarian society on issues such as agricultural practices, environmental protection measures, or even migration policies.  Nonetheless , despite these challenges , Bulgaria's EU membership continues to be seen as an overall positive development for the country . The integration into a larger European community has provided Bulgaria with access to resources , expertise , and opportunities that it would not have had otherwise . While there are still hurdles to overcome , being part of the European Union offers excellent potential for further development in areas such as education , innovation , infrastructure upgrades , environmental sustainability promotion industry expansion .  Looking ahead into future perspective s on Bulgaria's role in Europe  and beyond, it is crucial for both national authorities and civil society stakeholders alike to continue working towards strengthening democratic institutions increased transparency effectiveness combating corruption.

"n't just play an instrument; I aim to touch the hearts and souls of the audience. And one cannot truly connect with others if there is a constant stream of interruptions and distractions.  In this modern world, where technology has advanced at an incredible pace, it seems that everyone is constantly plugged into their devices. The incessant buzzing of notifications, the never-ending barrage of messages and emails consume our attention like a black hole. We have become addicted to constant stimulation, always seeking the next notification or update.  But amidst this chaos, there lies an essential need for pause. It is in those moments of quiet reflection that we can truly connect with ourselves and the world around us. We need to disconnect from our devices to reconnect with what truly matters – human connection.  Pausing allows us to appreciate the beauty in simple things: a warm cup of coffee on a chilly morning; a gentle breeze brushing against our skin as we walk through nature; or even just sitting quietly without any purpose or agenda when there's nothing else demanding our attention.  In my profession as a musician, pausing takes on another dimension. The greatest moments in music are often found in the spaces between notes - those pregnant pauses that create tension and release within a performance. It's during these rests that emotions can unfurl themselves within us, allowing profound depths to be explored and experienced.  A concert hall filled with people gathered together, entering into shared silence before a performance begins - it is almost magical. In that brief moment, time stands still as anticipation fills the air. And when music finally fills the void left by silence, it becomes an ethereal experience for both performers and listeners alike.  But pausing extends far beyond just music or personal reflection – it encompasses all aspects of life. When we pause before reacting in anger or frustration during conflicts with loved ones or colleagues, we allow ourselves space for empathy and understanding.  Moreover, pausing can also lead to greater productivity and creativity. When we allow our minds to rest and wander, free from the constant bombardment of notifications, ideas can blossom. Many great inventions and discoveries have happened during moments of repose, when the mind is given room to breathe.  Additionally, pausing can bring a sense of clarity in decision-making. By taking a step back from the immediacy of a situation, we can gain perspective and make more informed choices. It prevents us from acting impulsively or falling prey to societal pressures.  Perhaps most importantly, pausing allows us to appreciate the present moment fully. In our fast-paced lives, we are often too caught up in chasing after the next big thing that we fail to recognize the beauty in what already exists – be it a sunset painting hues across the sky or laughter shared with loved ones around a table.  So let us embrace pauses – not as empty voids but as moments filled with possibility and connection. It is through these pauses that we find harmony within ourselves and with those around us. The greatest thing in the world is indeed to pause; for within those moments lies an abundance of meaning waiting to be discovered.",continue
", Vouillamoz had a different idea in mind. He wanted to create a mechanical wristwatch that used water to indicate the time accurately.  Vouillamoz was inspired by the fluidity and symbolism of water. He saw time as an ever-flowing force, just like water. Instead of conventional watch hands or digital displays, he envisioned a watch that represented the passing of time through the movement of liquid.  With determination and unwavering belief in his idea, Vouillamoz set out to bring his unique concept to life. Over years of research and development, he assembled a team of talented engineers and watchmakers who shared his passion for innovation.  Their first hurdle was finding a way to harness the movement of water within such a compact space as a wristwatch. They had to create mechanisms that would allow the controlled flow of liquid without compromising its accuracy or reliability.  After countless prototypes and experiments, they finally achieved their breakthrough: tiny chambers within the watch's case that could hold precise amounts of water for each moment on the dial. These chambers were connected through custom-made microtubes filled with inert gases, preventing any contamination or evaporation while ensuring smooth flow mechanism.  To make it more convenient for users, Vouillamoz's team also incorporated magnetic technology into their design. By embedding magnets in strategic locations within the watch case and using magnetsized components inside each chamber, they were able to control the movement of water at precise intervals.  The result was an extraordinary wristwatch where time literally flowed like liquid across its face. At each second's passing, droplets meticulously traversed from one chamber to another until reaching their designated positions for minutes and hours.  The mastery behind this marvel did not stop at fluid mechanics alone; Vouillamoz understood that aesthetics played an integral part in consumer appeal. The dial itself was exquisitely crafted with intricate patterns representing ripples on calm waters during sunrise and sunset. The elegant dance of light on this unique surface added a touch of enchantment to the wearer's experience.  As word spread about this groundbreaking timepiece, skeptics transformed into admirers. Vouillamoz had defied conventional wisdom and created something truly innovative – a watch that could captivate the imagination while maintaining precise timekeeping.  The success of Vouillamoz's water-inspired wristwatch opened up new possibilities in horology. Other inventors and watchmakers began experimenting with similar concepts, leading to an entire genre of liquid timepieces that celebrated the flowing essence of water.  Today, these innovative watches continue to mesmerize and inspire. They serve as reminders for us all to appreciate the fluid nature of time, reminding us not to let life slip through our fingers like water but rather embrace every precious moment with attentiveness and gratitude.  The story of Lucien Vouillamoz serves as an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and dreamers alike. It reminds us that sometimes it takes courage to pursue our unconventional ideas against all odds. By staying true to our convictions, we can transform imaginary visions into tangible realities, shaping the future with innovation and creativity. Just like when time flows like water, so too can our wildest dreams come true if we dare to pursue them relentlessly.",continue
". This shift in sentiment can be attributed to a variety of factors, including global economic uncertainties and domestic challenges.  One of the main reasons for this decreased optimism is the current global economic climate. Despite some positive signs in certain countries, such as the United States and China, there are still concerns about a potential slowdown in global growth. Trade tensions between major economies and geopolitical uncertainties have created an atmosphere of caution among investors and businesses alike.  These external factors have had a direct impact on Switzerland's economy. As an export-driven nation, Switzerland heavily relies on international markets for its goods and services. Any decline in global demand can significantly affect Swiss exports, which in turn impacts domestic production and employment levels. With ongoing trade disputes and heightened protectionist measures implemented by various countries, it is understandable why Swiss voters may feel less optimistic about the economy.  Additionally, domestic challenges have contributed to this sense of pessimism among Swiss voters. While Switzerland has traditionally been known for its stability and strong financial sector, recent years have seen some cracks appearing in this reputation. The rise of crypto assets and new financial technologies has brought both opportunities and risks to the traditional banking industry.  Furthermore, demographic changes pose long-term challenges for Switzerland's economy. An aging population leads to increased healthcare costs while putting pressure on pension systems. Additionally, addressing these issues requires substantial investments which can strain public finances.  Political uncertainty also plays a role in shaping people's economic outlooks. While Switzerland has enjoyed relative political stability compared to other European countries, recent elections have shown an increasing polarization within the country as well as growing support for nationalist movements.  Despite these concerns contributing to pessimism among Swiss voters regarding their personal situations improving over the next year, it is important to note that overall optimism still exists at higher levels than during the crisis years between 2008 and 2011. This suggests that while people may be slightly more conservative with their expectations compared to last year when there was an increase in pessimism, they still hold a relatively positive outlook on the future.  Furthermore, Switzerland's strong economic fundamentals and diversified economy provide a solid foundation for resilience in the face of external challenges. The country has a highly skilled workforce, competitive industries such as pharmaceuticals, banking, and machinery manufacturing, and a reputation for quality and innovation. These factors continue to attract foreign investment and contribute to long-term economic growth.  In conclusion, Swiss voters' optimism regarding the economy has not increased relative to last year; instead, there has been a slight shift towards pessimism. This can be attributed to global economic uncertainties as well as domestic challenges such as demographic changes and political polarization. However, overall optimism remains higher than during the crisis years between 2008 and 2011 due to Switzerland's strong economic fundamentals. With continued focus on innovation and competitiveness along with effective management of domestic challenges, Switzerland can navigate through these uncertainties while maintaining its position as one of the leading economies globally.",continue

"increasingly interconnected global financial market.  Islamic finance, often referred to as ""Oriental finance,"" is a rapidly growing sector that adheres to the principles of Islam. It prohibits the charging or receiving of interest, as it is considered usury. Instead, Islamic finance promotes profit-sharing and asset-backed transactions, where risks and rewards are shared between parties involved.  The launch of this Sukuk by a leading American bank not only signifies its commitment to diversify its investor base but also highlights the growing recognition of Islamic finance as a legitimate alternative form of investment. The appeal lies in its ethical nature and resilience during economic downturns, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability in uncertain times.  Sukuk issuances have surged since the 2008 global financial crisis due to growing demand from both Muslim and non-Muslim investors for Sharia-compliant investments. In fact, according to data from Thomson Reuters, global Sukuk issuances reached $195 billion in 2019. This illustrates not only the popularity but also the acceptance of Islamic finance globally.  One key reason behind this rapid growth is that many Western countries are recognizing Islamic finance as an opportunity for economic growth and have taken steps to facilitate its development within their economies. For example, London has positioned itself as a leading center for Islamic banking outside of Muslim-majority countries by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework.  Furthermore, major financial institutions around the world have set up dedicated divisions focused on offering Sharia-compliant products and services. These institutions recognize that embracing Islamic finance can attract new customers from traditionally untapped markets.  In addition to attracting new customers, incorporating Islamic financial products into mainstream markets can promote financial inclusion by catering to the needs of previously underserved communities. This inclusiveness aligns with sustainable development goals outlined by various international organizations such as the United Nations.  However, despite its rapid growth and increasing acceptance worldwide, challenges remain within the industry. One primary concern is standardization across jurisdictions and scholars' interpretations of Sharia law. Unlike conventional finance, Islamic finance lacks a universally accepted set of rules and regulations.  This lack of standardization presents a hurdle for cross-border transactions as different interpretations of Sharia principles can lead to conflicting rulings. To address this issue, organizations like the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) have been working on harmonizing accounting standards in the industry.  Another challenge is the limited availability of skilled professionals who possess both Islamic finance knowledge and mainstream financial expertise. This shortage impedes the growth potential of Islamic finance, particularly in Western economies where expertise in both fields is crucial to develop innovative products and navigate complex regulatory environments.  Nonetheless, despite these challenges, it is evident that Oriental finance has taken global markets by storm. The launch of Sukuk by a leading American bank has not only broken barriers but also sparked discussions about the future direction of global finance.  With its ethical principles and emphasis on risk-sharing, Islamic finance presents an alternative model that prioritizes stability over excessive speculation. As traditional financial systems face increasing scrutiny for their role in previous crises, there is a growing interest in adopting more sustainable and resilient approaches to ensure long-term stability.  The rise of Oriental finance serves as a wake-up call for traditional financial institutions that must adapt to changing dynamics or risk being left behind. By embracing innovations such as Sukuk issuances and incorporating ethically sound practices into their operations, these institutions can tap into new avenues for growth while addressing concerns about sustainability within the broader global economy.  In conclusion, Oriental finance has made remarkable strides into global markets with its ethical principles and resilience during times of economic uncertainty. Despite challenges related to standardization and expertise shortages within the industry, there is no doubt that Islamic finance will continue to expand its reach worldwide through increased acceptance from traditional financial institutions seeking new opportunities for growth.",continue
"financial center faces and the opportunities and challenges this presents.  One of the main challenges for the Swiss financial center is regulatory pressure. After the global financial crisis, regulators around the world intensified their scrutiny on banks and financial institutions. This has led to stricter regulations in Switzerland, making it more difficult for banks to maintain their profitability. The introduction of Basel III regulations, for example, requires banks to hold higher capital reserves, reducing their ability to take risks and potentially affecting their profitability.  Another challenge is increased competition from other financial hubs around the world. While Switzerland has traditionally been a leading global financial center, other cities such as London, New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong have been attracting more business in recent years. These cities offer a wide range of financial services and have developed innovative solutions to meet changing client demands. As a result, Swiss banks are facing increased competition for clients and are struggling to differentiate themselves in this crowded market.  In order to address these challenges, Swiss banks need to adapt their business models and expand into new areas of growth. A key opportunity lies in wealth management services for emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America. With an increasing number of wealthy individuals in these regions looking for professional advice on managing their wealth, Swiss banks can leverage their expertise in private banking to capture a share of this growing market.  Another opportunity lies in sustainable finance. With global awareness about environmental issues increasing rapidly, there is a growing demand for investment products that promote sustainability. Switzerland is already known for its strong commitment to sustainability and has a long history of responsible investing. By further expanding into sustainable finance solutions such as green bonds or impact investing funds, Swiss banks can tap into this growing market segment while also aligning with global efforts towards addressing climate change.  Furthermore , advancements in technology present both opportunities and challenges for the Swiss financial center.The rise of fintech companies has disrupted traditional banking models by offering innovative digital solutions that are often more convenient and cost-effective. Swiss banks need to embrace these technological advancements and invest in their own digital capabilities to stay competitive. By leveraging technology, they can improve the efficiency of their operations, enhance customer experience, and offer new products and services.  On the other hand, technology also brings challenges such as cybersecurity risks. As financial transactions become increasingly digital, the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches increases. Swiss banks need to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect their clients' assets and information.  In conclusion , while Switzerland's financial center has historically been strong due to its safe-haven status and reputation for world-class banking services, it now faces a number of challenges that threaten its position. However, there are also opportunities for growth through expanding into emerging markets, sustainable finance solutions, and investing in technological advancements. By embracing these opportunities and addressing the challenges head-on, Swiss banks can continue to thrive as a global financial center. This will require resilience, innovation ,and adaptability – qualities that have been keyto Switzerland's success throughout history",continue
"is not being fully realized. In other words, the global economy is underperforming and failing to live up to its full potential.  One of the main reasons for this lackluster performance is the sluggishness in productivity growth. Productivity, or the amount of output produced per unit of input, is a key driver of economic growth. However, productivity growth has been stagnant in many advanced economies in recent years.  There are several factors contributing to this trend. One major factor is weak business investment. Many businesses have been hesitant to make large investments in new technologies and equipment due to uncertainty about future prospects and an unpredictable policy environment. This has resulted in a lack of innovation and technological progress, which ultimately dampens productivity growth.  Another factor is demographic changes. Aging populations in many developed countries are resulting in smaller workforces and slower labor force growth. This can have a negative impact on productivity as it reduces the number of workers available to generate output.  Additionally, income inequality has played a role in hindering global GDP growth potential. When wealth becomes concentrated at the top rather than distributed more evenly across society, it leads to lower consumption levels among those with lower incomes who tend to spend a larger portion of their earnings compared to high-income earners who save more. Consequently, reduced consumer spending suppresses overall economic demand and slows down GDP growth.  Moreover, trade tensions between major economies have created uncertainty and hindered global trade flows. Tariffs imposed by different countries on each other's goods have disrupted supply chains and increased costs for businesses operating internationally. These disruptions affect both exports and imports, reducing overall trade volumes and creating headwinds for economic expansion.  Furthermore, concerns over climate change impact GDP potential as well by threatening natural resources required for production processes while also increasing physical risks such as extreme weather events that can disrupt supply chains or damage infrastructure essential for economic activities.  To address these challenges and unlock higher global GDP potential requires concerted efforts from governments and policymakers worldwide. First, governments should prioritize policies that encourage business investment and innovation. This can be done through providing incentives for companies to invest in research and development, upgrading infrastructure, and fostering an environment conducive to entrepreneurship.  Secondly, addressing income inequality is crucial. Governments need to implement measures such as progressive taxation, increased access to quality education and healthcare, and social safety nets to ensure that economic benefits are more evenly distributed across society. By reducing income disparities, this can increase overall consumer spending levels and boost GDP growth.  Additionally, promoting open trade and resolving trade disputes would help restore confidence in the global economy. Collaborative efforts towards multilateral trade agreements based on equitable terms can ensure smoother international trade flows.  Finally, transitioning towards sustainable production methods is vital for maintaining long-term global GDP potential. Investing in renewable energy sources and adopting environmentally friendly policies can not only mitigate the risks associated with climate change but also create new opportunities for economic growth through green technologies.  In conclusion, while there are positive forecasts for global GDP growth this year compared to the previous one, it is clear that the global economy still underperforms relative to its potential. However, by addressing key challenges such as sluggish productivity growth, income inequality, trade tensions, and climate change concerns through effective policy measures at both national and international levels; there is a possibility of unlocking higher global GDP potential in the future",continue
"been relatively slow in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of around 0.7%. However, this growth is not evenly distributed across all Swiss cantons.  Some cantons have experienced significant population declines over the past few decades. This can be attributed to various factors such as migration patterns and economic opportunities in different regions. For example, some rural areas have seen a decrease in population as young people tend to move to more urban areas in search of better job prospects.  On the other hand, some growing cantons have seen a substantial increase in population. Cities like Zurich, Geneva, and Bern have become major centers of attraction for both domestic and international migrants due to their thriving economy and quality of life.  However, despite these regional variations, there is an overall trend of an aging population throughout Switzerland. The proportion of people aged 65 and over is expected to increase significantly by 2030 compared to today's figures. This demographic shift poses challenges for the country's social security system and healthcare infrastructure.  One immediate concern arising from this aging population is the strain it places on pension systems. With fewer active workers supporting a growing number of retirees, maintaining adequate funding for pensions becomes increasingly difficult. Policymakers will need to devise strategies that ensure a sustainable pension system while also promoting labor force participation among older individuals who are capable of working.  Another area impacted by this demographic change is healthcare services. An aging population typically requires more medical attention and long-term care facilities. The current healthcare infrastructure needs adaptation as it may struggle under increased demand if left unchanged.  Furthermore, the declining youth population raises concerns about future workforce availability and skills gaps within certain industries or regions. With fewer young people entering the labor market, businesses might face challenges finding skilled employees leading potentially stunting economic growth or forcing companies to seek talent from abroad through immigration policies that might prove controversial.  To address these challenges effectively on both political and economic fronts will require comprehensive policies that focus not only on supporting the elderly population but also on encouraging and facilitating the integration of young people into the workforce. Education and training programs that meet the demands of evolving industries can help bridge the skills gap and promote sustainable economic growth.  Additionally, implementing family-friendly policies, such as affordable childcare options and flexible work arrangements, may incentivize young couples to have more children. This approach has been successful in some European countries facing similar demographic challenges.  Ultimately, Switzerland will need to adopt a multi-faceted approach that balances its aging population's needs with those of future generations. By investing in education, healthcare infrastructure, labor market policies, and social security systems specifically tailored to support both older individuals and younger workers, Switzerland can navigate these demographic shifts successfully while maintaining its high standard of living.  In conclusion, Switzerland's aging population poses various economic and social challenges for policymakers. Addressing these challenges requires a nuanced understanding of regional variations in population trends as well as comprehensive solutions aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth while supporting both older citizens and younger generations.",continue
", I believe that financial markets play a crucial role in determining the value of assets and facilitating economic growth. Financial markets serve as a platform for buyers and sellers to come together and exchange various financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and derivatives.  One of the main functions of financial markets is price discovery. Through the forces of demand and supply, prices are determined based on market participants' collective assessment of an asset's value. This dynamic process helps ensure that assets are priced fairly based on their inherent characteristics and expected future prospects.  Financial markets also provide liquidity to investors. Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price. By bringing together myriad buyers and sellers from around the world, financial markets create a vibrant environment where investors can easily buy or sell their holdings at any time with minimal transaction costs.  Moreover, financial markets play a crucial role in channeling savings into productive investments. Individuals who have surplus funds can invest them in various financial instruments offered by these markets. These investments provide capital to businesses for expansion, research and development, infrastructure projects, and other economic activities that drive growth.  By allocating capital efficiently through pricing mechanisms like interest rates or equity valuations, financial markets encourage productive investment decisions while discouraging inefficient uses of resources. This allocative function ensures that capital is directed towards enterprises with high growth potential or those capable of generating positive social welfare outcomes.  Furthermore, the existence of well-functioning financial markets also promotes risk-sharing among participants. Individuals with excess resources are willing to lend money or invest in securities issued by other entities (such as governments or corporations) in return for interest payments or dividend income. In doing so, they bear some risk associated with asset performance while providing much-needed funds to borrowers who require capital for their activities.  The ability to transfer risk through hedging instruments like futures contracts or insurance policies enhances overall economic stability by mitigating fluctuations caused by unexpected events such as natural disasters, economic downturns, or market disruptions.  Financial markets also enable price transparency and efficient information dissemination. Market participants can access real-time prices and relevant news on various financial instruments, enabling them to make informed investment decisions. This transparency helps prevent information asymmetry and enhances market efficiency as investors can accurately assess the value of assets based on available information.  In addition to these fundamental roles, financial markets also contribute to economic growth by attracting international capital flows. Developed financial markets with robust regulatory frameworks and investor protection mechanisms are often seen as attractive destinations for foreign investments. These inflows create additional capital for domestic businesses and stimulate economic expansion while fostering technological advancements and knowledge transfer.  However, it is important to acknowledge that the functioning of financial markets is not without risks. Financial crises like the global financial crisis in 2008 have highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems. Excessive speculation, lax regulation, or inadequate risk management practices can lead to market instabilities with far-reaching consequences for individuals, businesses, and economies at large.  To mitigate such risks, regulators play a crucial role in ensuring that financial markets operate in a transparent manner while striking an appropriate balance between providing flexibility for innovation and safeguarding against systemic risks. Effective regulation promotes fair competition among market participants while protecting investors' interests and maintaining overall stability.  In conclusion, financial markets hold immense value within our modern economy by facilitating price discovery, providing liquidity, channeling savings into productive investments, promoting risk-sharing among participants, enhancing price transparency, and attracting international capital flows. However beneficial they are, it is important to carefully monitor their functioning, as they must be supported by robust regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential risks that could adversely impact individuals businesses, and economies as a whole. A well-functioning financial system underpinned by trust and integrity ultimately fosters economic growth and contributes towards societal development",continue
"unique design of the bank was inspired by the growing trend of drive-through services in America, particularly drive-in restaurants like McDonald's.  Dubbed ""Ketchup Banking"" by locals due to its association with fast food, this innovative concept aimed to make banking as convenient and accessible as ordering a burger. Customers no longer needed to park their cars and walk into a traditional bank branch; instead, they could simply stay in their vehicles while conducting their financial transactions.  The drive-through bank offered a wide range of services, including cash deposits and withdrawals, check cashing, account inquiries, loan applications, and even investment advice. Friendly and efficient tellers were stationed at each glass pavilion ready to assist customers swiftly. To further enhance customer convenience, the bank had extended operating hours compared to conventional branches.  The new approach proved highly popular among Swiss customers who embraced its simplicity and time-saving benefits. The initial success spurred Credit Suisse to expand the concept across Switzerland. Other major banks soon followed suit with their own drive-through branches in various cities.  What began as an experiment quickly evolved into an integral part of Swiss banking culture. Drive-through banking became synonymous with efficiency and convenience for busy individuals juggling work commitments or family responsibilities. Customers praised how it streamlined mundane tasks like depositing paychecks or paying bills without having to find parking or wait in queues inside stuffy branches.  As technology advanced over the years, Ketchup Banking also adapted accordingly. Remote deposit capture allowed customers to make check deposits from their vehicles using mobile devices linked directly to their accounts. Video conferencing capabilities were implemented for more complex banking needs such as mortgage applications or financial consultations with experts located at central offices.  Moreover, partnerships between banks and local businesses started emerging within these drive-through facilities. By leveraging existing relationships established through previous collaborations (such as credit card issuers), customers gained access not only to traditional banking but also added benefits like discounted meals at nearby restaurants or special offers on internet and mobile phone services. This innovative approach, known as ""Burgers 'n' Broadband,"" aimed to provide an all-encompassing experience for customers during their visit to the drive-through bank.  The success of Ketchup Banking extended beyond Switzerland's borders. Several international banks replicated the concept in their own countries, often adapting it to local traditions or preferences. In some places, drive-through ATMs became a common sight in addition to full-service branches.  Today, although digital banking has taken center stage with the rise of online and mobile applications, Ketchup Banking remains a beloved symbol of Swiss innovation and customer-centricity. The prominent St. -Peter-Strasse 17 branch continues to serve customers while maintaining its unique architectural design, attracting visitors curious about its history.  As society evolves, one thing remains constant: convenience drives progress. Ketchup Banking paved the way for banking services that adapt to people's ever-changing needs and lifestyles – a testament to Credit Suisse's forward-thinking approach more than half a century ago.  In recent years, the concept of Ketchup Banking has continued to evolve and adapt to the digital age. While drive-through branches still exist and serve as a convenient option for some customers, the focus has shifted towards providing seamless online and mobile banking experiences.  Credit Suisse recognized the importance of embracing technology early on and invested heavily in developing user-friendly digital platforms. Today, customers can access their accounts, complete transactions, and receive personalized financial advice through secure mobile apps or online portals. This shift towards digital channels has allowed people to conduct their banking needs from anywhere at any time, further enhancing convenience.  The Burgers 'n' Broadband concept also expanded beyond its initial scope. As banks partnered with a wider range of businesses, customers gained even more benefits from their drive-through banking experience. For example, in addition to restaurant discounts and special offers on communication services like internet and mobile phones, customers can now explore partnerships with retail outlets for cashback rewards or exclusive shopping deals.  Another noteworthy development within Ketchup Banking is the integration of innovative technologies to enhance security measures. Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition have become increasingly common in verifying customer identities during transactions conducted through drive-through branches or digital platforms. Advanced encryption techniques also ensure that customer information remains safe regardless of how they choose to bank.  Despite these advancements in technology and service offerings, drive-through branches have not been rendered obsolete by digital alternatives. On the contrary, they continue to play a crucial role for certain individuals who prefer face-to-face interactions or require more complex financial assistance. Drive-through branches offer a human touch while still ensuring efficiency and convenience for those who value it.  Looking ahead into an increasingly automated future where robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to revolutionize industries worldwide - including banking - it will be interesting to see how Ketchup Banking continues evolving once again. Perhaps we will see self-service kiosks equipped with AI-powered virtual assistants that can provide personalized recommendations based on customers' financial goals or utilize chatbots to resolve common inquiries.  Additionally, as sustainability becomes a growing concern across industries, Ketchup Banking could also incorporate eco-friendly initiatives. Drive-through branches could adopt solar power systems, encourage paperless transactions, and offer recycling services for electronic waste. By aligning with the global push towards sustainability and corporate responsibility, Ketchup Banking would not only enhance convenience but also contribute to a more environmentally conscious future.  In conclusion, Ketchup Banking has come a long way since its inception in 1962. What started as an experimental concept has become deeply woven into the fabric of Swiss banking culture. By embracing technological advancements, adapting to changing customer needs, and forging partnerships with local businesses, Credit Suisse's drive-through branches have remained relevant and beloved over the decades. As we continue into an increasingly digital age filled with technology-driven innovations, it will be fascinating to witness how Ketchup Banking evolves once again and continues to shape the future of banking in Switzerland and beyond.",continue
"is given the attention and support it deserves. Unfortunately, it often seems to be a forgotten continent on the global stage.  One of the main reasons for this is the persistent negative narrative surrounding Africa. For many, their perception of the continent is shaped by images of poverty, conflict, and disease. While these issues undoubtedly exist in certain parts of Africa, they do not define the entire continent.  Africa is incredibly diverse, with rich cultures and a wealth of natural resources. It has a young and vibrant population that is increasingly eager to drive positive change. Yet, all too often, its potential remains untapped due to lack of investment and opportunities.  The neglect Africa faces can also be attributed to historical factors. During colonial times, African nations were exploited for their resources without receiving adequate compensation or support for development. Even after gaining independence, many countries have struggled with political instability and corruption that hinder progress.  However, there are signs that things are beginning to change. Over recent years, there has been an increasing focus on promoting sustainable development in Africa. International organizations such as the United Nations have launched various initiatives aimed at addressing key challenges faced by the continent.  For instance, efforts are being made to improve access to education across Africa—a crucial step toward unlocking its potential. Education empowers individuals and provides them with tools they need to make a difference in their communities. It also contributes towards building a skilled workforce that can drive economic growth.  Moreover, investments in infrastructure are essential for enabling connectivity within African countries and facilitating cross-border trade and cooperation. Building reliable transportation networks will allow goods and services to reach far-flung communities easily while creating employment opportunities along these routes.  Another significant area where support is needed is healthcare—particularly when it comes to tackling infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS or malaria that still plague some parts of Africa despite remarkable progress being made in recent years through initiatives like PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief). Strengthening healthcare systems will not only improve the quality of life for millions but also help prevent outbreaks from becoming global crises.  In addition to external support, African leaders themselves have a crucial role to play in unlocking their continent's potential. They need to prioritize good governance and ensure that resources are managed transparently and effectively. Corruption undermines progress and erodes public trust, both domestically and internationally.  Finally, Africa needs fair trade deals that provide its farmers and businesses with opportunities to compete globally. By breaking down trade barriers, promoting access to markets, and fostering innovation, Africa can become a player on the global stage rather than merely an exporter of raw materials.  Africa should no longer be a forgotten continent but rather a vibrant part of the global community. It is up to all stakeholders—governments, international organizations, businesses, and individuals—to come together and work towards harnessing Africa's potential.  By doing so, we can rewrite the narrative surrounding Africa—one that focuses on its many successes rather than perpetuating stereotypes. A prosperous Africa will benefit not only Africans but also contribute significantly to global prosperity—a win-win situation for all involved. It is time we recognize that investing in Africa is an investment in our shared future.",continue
"States by the time I was only 12 years old. It was an unusual start to my career, and I often hear people say that I must have missed out on a normal childhood because of it. But, in truth, I wouldn't change a thing.  Being exposed to music at such a young age shaped me in ways that nothing else could have. While other kids were watching TV or playing games, I was honing my craft and developing a deep understanding of the symphonies and concertos that moved me so profoundly. Yes, it required sacrifice, but the rewards were immeasurable.  I believe that when you discover your passion early on and are lucky enough to have the support of your family and mentors who recognize your talent, there is no reason to hold back. My parents saw something special in me from the start and encouraged me wholeheartedly. They provided opportunities for me to study with renowned conductors such as Mitropoulos and Bernstein.  Of course, many critics will argue that starting so young leads to burnout or limits one's experiences. But for me personally, it only fueled my ambition. Conducting became my world; every performance felt like magic unfolding before my eyes as if each movement had been rehearsed a thousand times before but still held endless surprises.  While others may not understand or appreciate the intensity of dedicating oneself fully to an art form at such an early age, those who do will recognize why it is worth every sacrifice made along the way.  Throughout my career, both as a child prodigy conductor and later as one of the most celebrated maestros worldwide, I faced challenges beyond what many musicians face in their lifetimes. The pressure was immense; expectations continued to rise with each performance. Some might assume this kind of pressure would lead to regrets or second-guessing about pursuing such an extraordinary path from such a tender age.  However, looking back on all those years, I can honestly say that I have no regrets. The music became my solace, my sanctuary, and my raison d'être. It has always been worth every ounce of dedication and effort.  In a world where mediocrity often prevails, there is something remarkable about dedicating oneself fully to an art form without any reservations or hesitations. The path may be lonely at times, but the rewards are incomparable.  Yes, I missed out on some aspects of a traditional childhood - the carefree days spent with friends and indulging in innocent mischief. But instead of feeling robbed of those experiences, I feel grateful for what music gave me: discipline, focus, passion.  The experience I gained from conducting orchestras globally helped shape me as not just a musician but also as an individual. It taught me how to lead with grace under pressure and how to communicate deeply with others through the universal language of music.  Now reflecting back on my life's journey as one of the youngest conductors to have ever graced prestigious stages around the world, I can proudly say that it was all worth it. My only regret would be if someone else chose not to pursue their passion due to fears or doubts inspired by misconceptions about starting early.  So let this be an inspiration not just for musicians or performers but also for anyone who dares to follow their true calling in life regardless of societal norms or expectations. Dedicate yourself wholeheartedly; make sacrifices when necessary because greatness often requires it. Don't let fear hold you back from living your dreams; seize every opportunity that comes your way no matter how unconventional it may seem.  Maestro Maazel's journey demonstrates that pursuing one's passion relentlessly and fearlessly leads not only to personal fulfillment but also leaves an indelible mark on history—a reminder that talent recognized early should never be suppressed or undervalued—and that embracing opportunities wholeheartedly can lead to a life well-lived.",continue

"Global Wealth Reaches New All-Time High with Surge in Technology Sector  Despite the continuing challenges posed by the economic environment, the underlying factors this year have been broadly positive for global household wealth. However, this surge in personal wealth is not just a result of traditional sectors such as real estate or finance. Rather, it is the unexpected rise of the technology sector that has played a major role.  According to Credit Suisse's latest Global Wealth Report, released today, global personal wealth increased by an impressive 4.9 percent during the year to mid-2013, reaching an all-time high of $241 trillion. This growth has been driven by various factors including improving economies and stock market gains. But what really stands out is how technology stocks and companies have contributed significantly to individual fortunes worldwide.  The report reveals that average global wealth reached $51,600 per adult – a significant milestone since it crossed the $50,000 mark for the first time ever. The growing popularity and profitability of technology firms have cemented their position as major drivers of individual prosperity globally.  The tech revolution has created numerous digital billionaires who are redefining traditional concepts of personal affluence. Leading tech entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and Elon Musk (Tesla) have amassed vast fortunes through their innovative ventures.  Such success stories are not limited to Silicon Valley alone; they can be found around the world where tech hubs are thriving. For instance, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba saw its founder Jack Ma become one of China's wealthiest individuals overnight with its record-breaking IPO last year.  The influx of venture capital into promising start-ups further contributes to this meteoric rise in personal wealth related to technology-driven investments. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have disrupted traditional business models while simultaneously generating enormous profits for early-stage investors.  Additionally, there is a domino effect on employment opportunities within these burgeoning sectors: technological advancements lead to job creation which, in turn, fuels economic growth and consumption.  Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that this wealth generation in the technology sector also highlights a growing wealth divide worldwide. As technology widens its reach and becomes more pervasive in every aspect of our lives, individuals who are able to capitalize on these opportunities tend to amass substantial wealth while those left behind often face challenges keeping up.  The report emphasizes the importance of investing in digital literacy and providing equal access to technology for all citizens. Governments need to prioritize bridging this digital divide by implementing policies that foster inclusivity and provide opportunities for individuals from all socio-economic backgrounds.  Overall, the rise of global household wealth driven by the unprecedented surge in the technology sector is transforming notions of personal prosperity. It underscores the significance of technological advancements not only as drivers of economic growth but also as catalysts for social change.  As we navigate an increasingly interconnected world where tech moguls shape our daily lives, understanding these new dynamics becomes critical. The key lies not only in capitalizing on technology's potential but also in ensuring that prosperity resulting from technological progress benefits society at large rather than just a fortunate few.",create
"Title: Swiss Industries Set to Bounce Back in 2015: A Promising Outlook  Introduction: Swiss economic growth experienced turbulence in 2014, with setbacks dampening the initial momentum gained from improved foreign trade. However, industry experts predict a more positive trajectory for Swiss industries in 2015. While domestic-oriented sectors – such as retail, education, health, and social services – were amongst those hit by slower growth last year, a potential resurgence is on the horizon. This article delves into the anticipated rebound of these industries and highlights the reasons behind this positive outlook.  Retail Rejuvenation: After a lackluster performance in 2014 due to adverse consumer sentiment amid economic headwinds and cautious spending habits, retailers are poised for recovery. The stabilizing economy has bolstered confidence levels among consumers who have long awaited an excuse to indulge themselves once again. Retail giants are capitalizing on this window of opportunity by revamping their strategies to align better with evolving customer preferences and leveraging digital platforms to enhance their online presence.  Education Sector Innovations: The government-related education sector faced considerable challenges last year due to budgetary constraints across different cantons. However, forward-thinking institutions have devised innovative strategies that could redefine the sector's potential growth trajectory in 2015. Realizing the importance of technological advancements within educational programs, schools have begun incorporating STEM (Science, Technology Engineering & Mathematics) curricula more prominently into their frameworks. This shift aims to equip students with vital skills needed for tomorrow's workforce while attracting increased enrollment from international students seeking first-rate technical education.  Healthcare Modernization: Similar rejuvenation is expected within Switzerland's healthcare system as policymakers take proactive measures toward modernization and enhanced accessibility. The focus will be on reducing administrative burdens and facilitating greater patient-centered care through technology integration initiatives such as electronic health records (EHRs). Not only will this contribute towards improved efficiency but it will also enable healthcare professionals to provide more accurate and timely diagnoses, influencing positive patient outcomes.  Social Services Sector Transformation: The social services sector, encompassing areas like elderly care and welfare programs, has the potential to emerge stronger in 2015. Increased public awareness of the societal challenges brought forth by an aging population is driving a shift in priorities. Societal demand sits at the core of a renewed emphasis being placed on improving infrastructure for senior citizens, expanding community-based care solutions, and fostering intergenerational harmony through inclusive initiatives. Such developments indicate promising opportunities for growth within this vital sector.  Conclusion: After witnessing a lull in growth during 2014, Swiss industries are projected to rebound across various sectors and open doors to new possibilities in 2015. Retailers are adapting their strategies to cater more effectively to consumer needs and preferences. The education sector is embracing technological advancements while focusing on STEM education as part of its reform efforts. The healthcare system aims for greater accessibility through digital integration initiatives such as EHRs, ensuring enhanced patient-centered care delivery. Lastly, social service industries are undergoing transformative shifts to address societal challenges effectively.  Though headwinds were encountered last year within Swiss domestic-oriented sectors such as retail, education, health services ,and social services; an amalgamation of innovation-driven reforms promises brighter prospects ahead. As Switzerland's economic landscape stabilizes further amidst global uncertainties; these resilient industries stand ready to flourish with renewed vigor throughout 2015 and beyond.

"Title: The Rise of E-Commerce in Emerging Markets: Unlocking New Opportunities  The rebalancing of consumer growth between the developed and developing world has been instrumental in reshaping global markets. Over the past decade, emerging markets have witnessed a remarkable surge in consumer spending, outpacing their developed counterparts, as highlighted by Credit Suisse's renowned Megatrends analysis. However, amidst this growth trajectory, a new phenomenon has emerged, one that holds immense potential for both investors and consumers alike – the rise of e-commerce.  Globally, online retail has experienced exponential growth over the last few years. Led by giants such as Amazon and Alibaba, e-commerce has transformed traditional brick-and-mortar shopping into digital marketplaces accessible to anyone with an internet connection. While this trend has certainly influenced consumption patterns across developed economies, it is in emerging markets where its impact becomes truly transformative.  In countries like India and Brazil – two major players on the global economic stage – technological advancements are mending infrastructural gaps and accelerating digital adoption among their populations. This shift is vastly expanding access to digital platforms capable of connecting consumers with an unprecedented range of goods and services at competitive prices.  Recent research conducted by Credit Suisse indicates that GDP-weighted real growth in household consumer expenditure within emerging markets has consistently outperformed their developed counterparts over the past three decades. However, what sets apart this era from previous ones is not just higher consumption rates but rather how these purchases are being made - predominantly through e-commerce channels.  One cannot undermine the role played by smartphones in reshaping consumption habits in emerging markets. With affordable mobile devices flooding these regions' markets, millions have gained access to online marketplaces that were once considered distant dreams for individuals living outside urban centers. Now equipped with internet-enabled smartphones at their fingertips, previously marginalized communities can partake in a global marketplace without limitations.  Furthermore, cultural factors unique to emerging economies are driving further adoption of e-commerce. In many developing nations, consumer trust is deeply rooted in digital recommendations and word-of-mouth marketing. Social media and online influencers have become powerful catalysts for promoting products and services, swiftly bridging the trust gap between consumers and unfamiliar brands.  The surge in e-commerce adoption within emerging markets presents a plethora of opportunities for both local entrepreneurs and global investors seeking untapped potential. Start-ups across various sectors are seizing this moment by creating innovative platforms tailored to specific market needs – from food delivery apps reaching remote villages to education platforms revolutionizing access to knowledge in underserved communities.  Companies at the forefront of these trends are already reaping the rewards. Take, for example, an Indian-based fintech start-up that recently secured significant funding after establishing itself as a trusted platform connecting rural farmers with urban consumers directly via e-commerce channels. By cutting out intermediaries, both parties benefit from fairer prices while unlocking new revenue streams for smaller farming communities traditionally overlooked by large agriculture conglomerates.  As expectations heighten around emerging market e-commerce growth forecasts, multinational corporations are also adjusting their strategies to capture this consumer boom effectively. Global retail giants are actively partnering with local players or acquiring existing digital platforms to tap into unique networks built on localized insights and customer preferences.  Despite these promising developments, challenges persist within the emerging market landscape. Connectivity gaps remain prevalent in certain regions, limiting accessibility to online shopping channels for some remote communities or perpetuating disparities across socio-economic groups where internet penetration remains low.  Nonetheless, governments recognize the transformative power of digitization in fueling economic progress and are investing heavily in expanding digital infrastructure nationwide. Initiatives focusing on broadband expansion aim to close connectivity gaps while fostering inclusive growth models that uplift underserved populations on the journey toward sustainable development.  The rise of e-commerce within emerging markets heralds an era of unprecedented opportunities for businesses worldwide while empowering consumers with greater choices at competitive prices.Savvy investors will navigate this changing landscape by identifying innovative start-ups and established players poised to seize the untapped potential within these burgeoning digital marketplaces. As global economic power continues to shift, a new chapter in consumer growth is being written, one where e-commerce plays a central role in reshaping the world economy.  The Credit Suisse Bulletin will continue to monitor this dynamic trend closely, providing insights into emerging market dynamics and strategies for capitalizing on this transformative wave of online retail.",create
"Title: Eurozone Recovery Gains Momentum as Quantitative Easing Measures Deliver Promising Results  Byline: [Author Name], Economics Correspondent  Date: [Current Date]  After facing months of economic uncertainty, the Eurozone is finally witnessing tangible improvements in its prospects, thanks to the successful implementation of quantitative easing measures by the European Central Bank (ECB). Building upon previous efforts to stimulate growth, this bold move is already demonstrating positive results and instilling renewed confidence in financial markets.  Having initiated purchases of private sector covered bonds and asset-backed securities at the end of 2014, it became evident that these markets were insufficient to achieve the ECB's intended balance sheet expansion of €1 trillion. Consequently, an expanded approach was necessitated to further support monetary policy objectives.  The ECB introduced targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), offering cost-effective loans from the central bank to commercial banks. However, initial results were lukewarm as uptake remained below expectations. Nonetheless, recent developments indicate a promising turnaround for these operations.  The successful implementation of quantitative easing measures has been attributed to various factors. Firstly, low-interest rates have enabled easier access to credit for businesses and households alike. This injection of liquidity has stimulated economic activity by encouraging consumption and investment.  Secondly, reduced borrowing costs have catalyzed a surge in lending by commercial banks across Europe. The enhanced profitability resulting from wider net interest margins has allowed banks greater flexibility in extending loans to corporations seeking expansion opportunities or individuals desiring alternative investments.  Furthermore, quantitative easing has contributed significantly towards alleviating deflationary pressures within the Eurozone. By increasing investor confidence through improved growth prospects and stability expectations, inflationary expectations are being reinforced gradually but promisingly.  As a result of these collective initiatives undertaken by monetary policymakers across Europe's major economies – Germany excluded – there are clear signs indicative of an imminent turnaround throughout Eurozone economies:  1) Increased Consumer Confidence: Recent surveys indicate an upswing in consumer sentiment across various Eurozone countries. A positive shift in mindset, coupled with lower borrowing costs, has bolstered spending on durable goods and services, contributing to healthier domestic demand.  2) Strengthened Business Investment: The injection of liquidity into markets has catalyzed a surge in business investment. Corporations are increasingly capitalizing on historically low financing rates to expand operations, develop new products or services, and explore untapped growth opportunities.  3) Manufacturing Sector Growth: Signs of revival have been witnessed within the manufacturing sector as increased demand fosters production expansion. Industrial output indices across key European economies demonstrate notable improvement post-quantitative easing implementation.  4) Enhanced Global Competitiveness: The depreciation of the euro against major currencies has bolstered export competitiveness for eurozone companies. This favorable exchange rate condition is attracting foreign consumers and boosting export-driven sectors such as automotive and technology industries.  Amid these optimistic developments, it is vital to acknowledge the potential downside risks that quantitative easing may pose in the long term. Concerns over future inflationary pressures persist, while ongoing geopolitical tensions remain unpredictable factors that could dent sustained economic recovery efforts.  Nonetheless, considering the current trajectory and early successes witnessed post-quantitative easing implementation, economists project continued improvement throughout Eurozone economies throughout this year and beyond. However, it is crucial for policymakers to remain cautious while guarding against complacency amidst fragile global economic conditions.  As Europe embarks upon an encouraging path towards economic revitalization through concerted monetary policy initiatives led by the ECB's quantitative easing measures—backed by individual government structural reforms—the Credit Suisse Bulletin will continue monitoring these developments closely to provide its readers with valuable insights into this transformative phase of the Eurozone's recovery journey.

"Sir John Major: US and UK Will Exceed Growth Expectations  Sir John Major, the former British Prime Minister, expressed his confidence in the economic recovery of the United States and the United Kingdom in a recent interview with the Credit Suisse Bulletin. He emphasized that while both countries have made significant progress since the financial crisis of 2008, there is still work to be done.  ""The global economy is certainly in recovery,"" Sir John remarked. ""It's a good deal better than it was 12 months ago, and I suspect it will continue to improve over the next 12 months - perhaps faster than we may have imagined in some parts of the world.""  Acknowledging that many economies are not yet on par with pre-crisis levels, Sir John highlighted key areas where he believes progress will exceed expectations, particularly focusing on developments within highly influential markets.  The United States has been at the forefront of global economic recovery efforts. With an ambitious vaccination campaign underway and substantial fiscal stimulus packages being rolled out by President Joe Biden's administration, Sir John predicts significant economic growth for America.  ""Consumer spending is expected to soar as more people gain confidence in returning to normalcy,"" stated Sir John. ""The Biden administration's focus on infrastructure investment will further stimulate economic activity across various sectors.""  The United Kingdom has also demonstrated resilience throughout these challenging times. Although Brexit posed numerous uncertainties for its economy, Sir John remains optimistic about Britain's future prospects following its departure from the European Union.  ""Despite initial teething issues post-Brexit, I believe that UK businesses are adapting swiftly,"" said Sir John. ""Investment into new trade partnerships combined with high-level skills development will be crucial elements driving growth for years to come.""  Moreover, he highlighted advancements in technology and innovation as catalysts for rapid expansion within both nations.  ""Investment in research and development must remain at record levels if we want our economies to thrive,"" explained Sir John. ""The US and the UK have long been leaders in technological advancements, and we must continue to capitalize on these strengths to spur further growth.""  Nevertheless, Sir John noted potential challenges that need to be addressed. He emphasized the importance of addressing income inequality and boosting productivity through comprehensive reforms.  ""Income disparity continues to hinder inclusive growth,"" warned Sir John. ""Efforts should be made to ensure that all segments of society benefit from the economic recovery, reducing social imbalances.""  He also stressed the necessity of investment in green technologies, acknowledging climate change as a formidable threat that requires immediate attention.  ""We cannot afford to neglect our responsibility towards combating climate change,"" pleaded Sir John. ""Sustainable practices will not only protect our planet but also present new economic opportunities for countries globally.""  As global economies gradually recuperate from the impact of the financial crisis, it is increasingly apparent that collaborative efforts are crucial for sustained growth. Sir John Major's astute observations underline this fact and provide valuable insights into how both the US and UK can surpass expectations by capitalizing on their unique strengths.

"Swiss Companies Embrace Diversity for Long-Term Growth   By Valeria Rossi, Financial Correspondent  Zurich, Switzerland – In an era marked by global interconnectedness, Swiss companies are welcoming a diverse and talented workforce to drive long-term growth. This shift comes as a response to the increasing need for innovation and adaptability in the face of dynamic market dynamics.  The Confederation of Swiss Employers (CSE) recognizes the necessity of embracing immigration to sustain retirement provision and preserve the benefits of free movement. Prominent figures within the CSE have voiced concerns about arbitrary regulations and a growing trend towards compartmentalization that threatens Switzerland's competitive edge.  ""Our labor market thrives on diversity,"" affirms Valentin Vogt, President of the CSE. ""Switzerland is currently leading in global competitiveness, having created about 500,000 jobs over the past decade.""  Indeed, Switzerland's thriving economy boasts an impressive unemployment rate of only 3 percent while successfully keeping youth unemployment at bay. The contribution made by immigrants cannot be underestimated as they bring fresh perspectives and skills that help bridge knowledge gaps within various industries.  To highlight this significant influence on Swiss businesses, Credit Suisse conducted an in-depth study exploring how immigrant workers have positively impacted different sectors. The report reveals that immigrant employees consistently demonstrate higher levels of creativity and entrepreneurial spirit compared to their native counterparts.  ""One key finding is that immigrant workers tend to be more open-minded when approaching problem-solving,"" says Julia Fischer-Kocherhans, lead researcher at Credit Suisse Economic Research division. ""This characteristic has allowed companies across diverse industries to adapt swiftly during periods of disruption.""  Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is one example where diversity has been leveraged effectively for growth. The company actively recruits international talent from various cultural backgrounds through targeted programs like the Novartis Global Trainee Program (NGTP).  By embracing this approach, Novartis witnessed enhanced collaboration among employees, leading to breakthrough innovations and an expanded global reach. The NGTP has been praised for its ability to foster cross-cultural understanding and drive creativity within the company.  Other Swiss companies have followed suit, recognizing that diversity fosters innovation, boosts employee morale, and ultimately contributes to improved financial performance. Companies like UBS and Nestlé have implemented initiatives aimed at attracting international talents who can bring different perspectives to the table.  Sascha Schneidermann, head of corporate talent acquisition at UBS Group AG, shares his insights: ""Diverse teams enable us to be more customer-focused in a complex market environment. We seek employees from all backgrounds who can contribute unique ideas that cater to our clients' diverse needs.""  Despite these positive developments in the Swiss business landscape, challenges persist in ensuring equal opportunities for immigrant workers. Many companies continue to face barriers such as unconscious bias in recruitment processes and a lack of systemic support for integrating immigrants into company culture.  To address these issues comprehensively, renowned organizations like Credit Suisse have launched corporate social responsibility programs aimed at promoting inclusivity within their own institutions while driving change industry-wide.  Through initiatives such as mentoring schemes, cultural awareness training workshops, and community engagement activities, businesses are taking proactive steps towards creating an environment where every employee feels valued regardless of their background or nationality.  With Switzerland's economy heavily reliant on international trade and cross-border partnerships, immigration will remain a critical factor in securing long-term growth potential. By embracing diversity across industries with continued determination towards inclusivity efforts – both within individual companies and on a national scale – Switzerland is poised to solidify its position as one of the world's economic powerhouses well into the future.

"The Rise of Digital Currencies: A New Battlefield in Currency Wars?  In a global financial landscape that is ever-evolving and rife with competition, the concept of currency wars has become increasingly prominent. However, while traditional battles over exchange rates have garnered significant attention in recent years, a new contender has emerged that could potentially shift the balance of power even further - digital currencies.  With the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, central bankers find themselves facing an entirely different playing field than their predecessors. These virtual forms of money operate independently from traditional monetary systems, and their decentralized nature presents both opportunities and challenges to the world's major economies.  In this rapidly changing landscape, where the boundaries between physical and digital currency are blurring, many ask whether central banks are truly engaged in ""currency wars."" According to a recent report by Credit Suisse entitled ""The Rise of Digital Currencies: A New Battlefield,"" experts argue that this modern-day phenomenon may indeed constitute an uncharted battlefield for central bankers.  Ric Deverell, Head of Global Commodities Strategy at Credit Suisse, suggests that while traditional concepts of currency manipulation and exchange rate policies might not apply directly to digital currencies just yet, they do have implications on monetary stability. Deverell states, ""Digital currencies have gained traction globally but remain largely unregulated. As they continue to grow in popularity...central banks must navigate these new waters carefully.""  One key concern for policymakers is managing potential risks associated with digital currencies. Unlike fiat money issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are created through complex algorithms known as mining processes or distributed ledger technologies like blockchain. This lack of centralized control means that there can be significant volatility and speculation around their value.  While some countries like Japan have embraced cryptocurrencies by regulating them as legal tender within their borders, others have taken a more cautious approach due to concerns about potential illicit activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.  Given these challenges and uncertainties surrounding digital currencies, the question arises as to whether central banks should view them as potential allies or adversaries. Deverell opines, ""Central banks must find a delicate balance between embracing innovation and safeguarding financial stability.""  The report suggests that major economies can strategically leverage the rising tide of digital currencies by exploring their underlying technology, blockchain. By adopting this innovative ledger system, central banks may streamline processes such as interbank transactions and cross-border payments. Furthermore, it could enhance transparency and reduce costs in various areas of financial services.  However, embracing cryptocurrencies also introduces risks for central banks concerned about maintaining control over monetary policy. The decentralized nature of digital currencies challenges traditional concepts like interest rates or money supply controls that are crucial tools for managing inflation and economic stability.  As nations grapple with these evolving complexities, Credit Suisse's report emphasizes the need for global coordination on addressing challenges posed by digital currencies. By engaging in international dialogue and establishing regulatory frameworks that strike a balance between innovation and stability, policymakers can collectively navigate this unchartered territory.  While currency wars have traditionally revolved around exchange rate fluctuations impacting competitive advantage in global trade relationships - the rise of digital currencies creates an additional dimension to this complex landscape. As central bankers explore how best to adapt to this new battlefield within their jurisdiction's borders while coordinating on global policies concerning cryptocurrencies, their decisions will shape not only monetary systems but also potentially transform our notion of modern-day finance.  In conclusion, advocates propose that instead of fearing the rise of digital currencies as another front in currency wars; governments should seize opportunities presented by technological advancements while ensuring prudent risk management practices are implemented. Only time will tell how well central banks maneuver through these challenging terrain marked by emerging virtual forms of money – where traditional approaches alone may no longer suffice. ",create
"Title: Future Steps for Euro Bonds: A Compromise Amidst Political Turmoil  Subtitle: Common Eurozone bonds prove theoretically logical, but political hurdles loom large  By Joe Prendergast, Special Correspondent  In an era of economic uncertainty and diverging interests within the European Union (EU), the topic of common Eurozone bonds has once again taken center stage. This financial instrument holds the potential to resolve a myriad of problems from a creditor's perspective. While theoretical arguments in favor of issuing such bonds seem compelling, political realities have made it clear that this solution remains elusive for now.  Eurozone heavyweights find themselves at odds when it comes to embracing common euro bonds as a tool for fostering fiscal solidarity. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an influential figure within the EU, recently dismissed this maneuver as ""exactly the wrong answer."" However, keen observers suggest that Merkel's concerns are primarily rooted in political complications rather than theoretical shortcomings.  The current debate surrounding common euro bonds brings into focus whether such instruments would truly make sense under prevailing conditions. In theory, pooling resources and sharing debt among member nations could promote stability and alleviate financial stress on highly indebted countries. The creation of a Financial Stabilization Fund acting as a vehicle for common bond issuance is seen by some experts as a potential compromise between opposing views.  Leading analysts like Tomás Cortés-Tovar argue that economic logic necessitates exploring alternative avenues towards fostering greater solidarity within the bloc. Cortés-Tovar states, ""Common euro zone issuance could offer respite to struggling economies burdened with mounting debt while reducing costs associated with individual borrowing.""  However, practical implementation remains intricately entwined with shifting power dynamics and conflicting national interests across Europe. Some politicians argue that yielding control over sovereign debt policies threatens their nations' autonomy, leading to tensions not easily reconciled through dialogue alone.  Nevertheless, amidst these challenges stand groundbreaking negotiations aimed at steering Europe towards deeper financial integration. Recent discussions among EU member states have shed light on potential compromises that could lay the groundwork for future euro bond issuance.  While exact details remain undisclosed, insiders hint at a possible framework that balances exerting fiscal discipline while fostering greater interdependence. Under this proposal, countries willing to meet stringent budgetary requirements and implement structural reforms would gain access to common bond issuance and benefit from lower borrowing costs. Should these initiatives come to fruition, it could mark a significant milestone in resolving long-standing economic disparities across the Eurozone.  The perceived merits of pooling resources extend beyond mere monetary support. Proponents of common euro bonds argue that this endeavor would foster greater trust among member states, enabling closer collaboration on other pressing issues within Europe – including climate change mitigation and security challenges.  To achieve this vision, however, political leaders must navigate complex negotiations marked by varying priorities and public sentiments across the continent. The task at hand involves finding consensus on vital aspects such as risk-sharing mechanisms, decision-making protocols for fund disbursement, and safeguards against moral hazard concerns.  As negotiations intensify behind closed doors in Brussels and key European capitals, the Eurozone finds itself standing at a crossroads between further integration or succumbing to fragmentation fueled by diverging interests.  In conclusion, while theoretical arguments continue to highlight the logical path forward through common Eurozone bonds, political realities pose substantial barriers. As influential leaders like Angela Merkel voice concerns over potential implications on national sovereignty, compromise becomes essential to pave the way for deeper financial integration in Europe. Only time will tell if policymakers can surmount these obstacles and forge ahead towards an economically united Europe borne out of shared responsibilities and mutual trust.

"Title: Increasing Digitization Drives Innovation in the Swiss Export Industry  Introduction  Switzerland stands as a global powerhouse with an export industry that continuously excels on the world stage. The success of this sector is crucial for the country's economic growth and its overall prosperity. Without exports, Switzerland would have faced economic stagnation; however, thanks to its ability to tap into foreign markets, Switzerland has thrived and achieved consistent economic growth. Today, we delve deeper into one aspect that has contributed significantly to this success - increasing digitization and its impact on innovation within the Swiss export industry.  Digital Transformation Fuels Growth  The rapid pace of digital transformation has significantly changed the landscape for businesses worldwide.

"The Swiss Real Estate Market Continues to Thrive: Sustainable Growth or a Bubble in the Making?  Zurich, Switzerland – Despite economic uncertainties and global financial turbulence, Switzerland's real estate market remains robust and attractive for investors. Low mortgage interest rates have been the driving force behind this demand, with experts predicting that the trend will continue throughout 2013. However, there are growing concerns about a potential property bubble and its impact on the economy.  The current alluring scenario can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, residential property prices have soared due to historically low mortgage rates. The annual financial costs of owning a condominium are just half of what it would cost to rent a similar apartment annually. This disparity has incentivized many individuals towards homeownership rather than renting.  Moreover, salary trends in Switzerland remain stable despite global economic turmoil. Much like previous years, employers have continued offering competitive wages to attract and retain skilled professionals—boosting purchasing power within the housing market.  Additionally, Swiss policymakers estimate that net immigration will surpass 60,000 this year—a figure only slightly lower than 2012's record high. The influx of foreign individuals seeking opportunities in Switzerland has further fueled housing demand across major cities like Zurich and Geneva.  However, industry insiders warn against complacency amid these seemingly favorable conditions. In an effort to avoid over-indebtedness among homeowners—a major concern during past market crashes—the government introduced self-regulatory measures mandating higher levels of equity for home buyers.  While these stricter rules help ensure responsible lending practices by banks and mitigate risk exposure for both borrowers and lenders alike—there is concern they may hinder first-time buyers from entering the market or exacerbate affordability issues amid soaring property prices.  Critics argue such measures could shrink demand in certain segments of the real estate market—particularly among low-income earners who struggle with saving substantial amounts for down payments on properties in major cities where prices remain exorbitant compared to rural areas.  Efforts to balance market sustainability and affordability have been met with mixed reactions. One school of thought suggests policymakers should introduce further regulatory measures to curb speculative activities and avoid an unsustainable housing bubble that could potentially devastate the overall economy—a scenario witnessed during the global financial crisis in 2008.  On the other hand, proponents of a laissez-faire approach argue that market forces should determine property values without external interference. They contend that regulations may impede economic growth, discourage foreign investors, or make it harder for young professionals to enter the property ladder—thus stifling entrepreneurship and innovation in various sectors of the Swiss economy.  As Switzerland continues to attract international attention as a safe haven amidst geopolitical uncertainties, real estate remains an essential asset class for both domestic and foreign investors seeking stability. However, experts caution potential buyers to exercise due diligence when entering this thriving market and carefully evaluate their investment strategies against long-term economic factors.  While today's low interest rates make borrowing appealing—credit conditions can change rapidly due to prevailing global forces or domestic shifts in monetary policy. It is crucial for prospective buyers and industry stakeholders to remain vigilant regarding evolving market dynamics that may impact investment returns over time.  As Switzerland navigates through unchartered waters amid a post-pandemic world, striking a balance between sustainable growth within its real estate sector while mitigating speculative risks will be paramount in safeguarding its robust economy—a task requiring rigorous analysis by both policymakers and investors alike.",create

"Title: ""Switzerland's Aging Population Sparks Growing Demand for Pension Reforms""  Introduction  In recent years, Switzerland has witnessed a remarkable increase in life expectancy due to advancements in healthcare and improved quality of life. The aging population poses significant challenges to the sustainability of the pension system, making it imperative for policymakers to implement comprehensive reforms that ensure stability and adequacy for future retirees.  Rising Life Expectancy Sustains Pressure on the Pension System  According to recent studies, Swiss citizens aged 65 today can expect an average of 17.1 more years for men and 20.9 years for women. This stark contrast from conditions during the establishment of Old Age and Survivors' Insurance (AHV) in 1948 underscores the complexity faced by policymakers today.  The Shift Towards Healthy Aging  As society increasingly embraces healthier lifestyles, there is a growing emphasis on promoting wellbeing among seniors. Switzerland's population has taken a proactive approach towards maintaining their health, resulting in longer periods of active retirement.  Acknowledging this paradigm shift, experts suggest that encouraging employability beyond traditional retirement ages could be a viable solution. Enabling flexible working arrangements or encouraging knowledge transfer through mentorship programs could help retain experienced workers within various sectors while also supporting economic growth.  Demographic Dynamics Present Challenges  Statistics also reveal an emerging issue related to declining birth rates across Switzerland. With fewer individuals entering the workforce compared to those exiting through retirement, this demographic change further strains existing pension schemes' financial viability.  Integration of Private Sector Initiatives  Recognizing the need for collective efforts towards pension reform, several private companies have pioneered innovative models that bridge funding gaps between employers and employees. By partnering with financial institutions, such initiatives offer tailored savings plans alongside employer-contribution benefits tailored specifically for extended careers or phased retirements.  Meanwhile, ongoing collaborations between industry experts and governmental entities aim to explore alternative sources of funding without compromising existing social security provisions commonly associated with AHV pensions.  Focus on Sustainable Investment Strategies  Given the future uncertainties surrounding pension sustainability, investment experts are actively promoting sustainable investment strategies. This approach aligns with Switzerland's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Integrating ESG criteria within portfolio management not only provides stable long-term returns but also contributes to the achievement of globally recognized sustainability goals.  Expanding Access to Voluntary Pension Schemes  To address increasing concerns regarding pension adequacy and retirement planning, Switzerland is considering expanding access to voluntary pension schemes beyond mandatory contributions. Encouraging workers of all income levels to invest additional funds into supplementary pensions will help individuals build a stronger financial cushion for their retirement years.  International Collaboration as a Catalyst for Success  Recognizing that demographic challenges extend beyond national borders, Swiss policymakers have sought collaboration opportunities with international counterparts. Sharing research findings and best practices offers valuable insights into addressing common issues associated with aging populations, fostering informed policy developments.  Conclusion  Switzerland stands at a crossroads where bold decisions are needed to confront the complex challenges posed by an aging population and ensure a financially sound future for retirees. By implementing innovative reforms that take into account evolving societal dynamics and leveraging private sector initiatives alongside government programs, Switzerland can create a sustainable framework that safeguards the well-being of its citizens throughout their retirement years. Through proactive collaboration both domestically and internationally, Switzerland can pave the way toward comprehensive solutions in securing pensions for generations to come. ",create

"The Hidden Costs of ""Bad"" Investments: The Case of Big Tobacco  Cinema has always portrayed Wall Street as a breeding ground for unscrupulous characters, epitomized by the infamous Gordon Gekko in the movie ""Wall Street."" Greed and dubious behavior seem to go hand in hand. But is this cinematic portrayal an accurate reflection of reality? And more importantly, does it actually pay to be ""bad"" when it comes to investing?  In a groundbreaking study conducted by Credit Suisse, experts set out to examine whether socially responsible investments truly deliver better returns and if investors can effectively respond to corporate misconduct. As responsible investing gains traction among market participants, this study sought concrete answers, shedding light on one particular industry notorious for its questionable practices - Big Tobacco.  Traditionally considered a controversial investment sector due to the severe health risks associated with smoking, tobacco companies have long polarized shareholders and ethical investors alike. But are these concerns justified? Is there tangible evidence suggesting that socially responsible investments outperform companies involved in activities deemed harmful or unethical?  The findings may surprise you.  Despite being riddled with health-related controversies over several decades, tobacco companies have consistently proven themselves as solid performers in financial markets. Credit Suisse's research paints a compelling picture; not only do these companies generate sustainable profits year after year but they also offer strong dividend yields and financial stability.  However, it would be remiss not to consider the hidden costs that accompany such lucrative gains. Investing in big tobacco carries ethical consequences; supporting an industry known for addictive substances leading to millions of premature deaths cannot be ignored.  This dilemma presents investors with a critical question: Can they reconcile their desire for profitable returns with their moral compass?  Fortunately, Credit Suisse's study doesn't stop at highlighting the paradox but proposes potential actionable solutions tailored specifically towards conscientious investors who seek both financial rewards and moral peace of mind.  One avenue explored is engagement through shareholder activism. By becoming active shareholders, investors can exert pressure on management to improve corporate behavior and adopt more sustainable practices. This proactive approach empowers investors to influence company policies while still capitalizing on the financial gains such firms offer.  On a broader scale, the study suggests increased transparency and disclosure requirements for so-called ""sin"" industries. By establishing clearer reporting guidelines regarding corporate social responsibility in sectors rife with controversy, investors can make well-informed choices that align with their values.  Moreover, this research reveals a growing trend among socially responsible investment funds that actively exclude companies involved in businesses deemed harmful or unethical. While these divestments may initially limit the pool of potentially lucrative investments, they ensure portfolio alignment with ethical standards.  John Davies, Head of Responsible Investment Global Research at Credit Suisse, comments: ""Responsible investing is no longer just a fad; it's a fundamental paradigm shift within the investment community. Investors are increasingly recognizing that long-term gains require both profit sustainability and ethical integrity.""  By encouraging dialogue between stakeholders and promoting awareness of societal impact alongside financial performance metrics, Credit Suisse aims to redefine modern investment paradigms and stimulate conscious capitalism.  As investors navigate increasingly complex market landscapes fraught with moral ambiguities, responsible investing emerges as an opportunity for real change - one where profits don't come at the expense of our collective values. With big tobacco serving as merely one example of an industry facing scrutiny over its ethical implications, it becomes evident that responsible investing holds considerable potential to shape markets towards more sustainable outcomes.  Ultimately, whether it pays to be ""bad"" is a decision each investor must make for themselves. But as Credit Suisse's groundbreaking study demonstrates when offered potential solutions alongside proven financial rewards - being good might not only feel right but could also yield solid returns for those willing to embrace them.",create
"Title: Swiss SMEs Embrace Innovation in the Face of Uncertainty  Introduction: Uncertainty in the global economic landscape has long been a challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) worldwide, and Switzerland is no exception. With over 99 percent of Swiss businesses falling into the SME category, these resilient companies form the lifeblood of the nation's economy. This year's ""Success Factors for Swiss SMEs"" study by Credit Suisse economists highlights an emerging trend – that despite prevailing uncertainty, innovative approaches towards investment are driving these enterprises forward.  The Current State of Affairs: Swiss SMEs have historically thrived due to their ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, but there is growing concern among business owners about ongoing volatility caused by factors such as international trade tensions and global market fluctuations. However, this apprehension has not stalled entrepreneurial creativity; instead, it has sparked a drive toward innovation as companies seek alternative methods to sustain growth.  Redefining Investment Strategies: According to data compiled from Credit Suisse's extensive survey of Swiss SMEs, a staggering 85 percent expressed heightened interest in diversifying their investment portfolios beyond traditional avenues.

This support extends beyond traditional banking institutions as alternative financing avenues continue to emerge such as crowdfunding or angel investing platforms tailored towards SME needs.  Conclusion - Pioneering Ahead: In the face of uncertainty inhibiting conventional forms of investment, Swiss SMEs display an unwavering spirit to find creative solutions and forge new paths forward. Their confidence in embracing innovation is testament to the agility ingrained within these dynamic enterprises.

"Title: Transforming Food Systems: Tackling Food Loss and Waste for a Sustainable Future  Subtitle: Innovative Solutions Ensure Efficient Food Distribution, Reducing Environmental Impact  Byline: [Author Name], Environmental Correspondent  [City], [Date] - In the ongoing effort to address the environmental impact of our food systems, researchers and entrepreneurs are making substantial strides in addressing one of the greatest challenges faced by developing countries – reducing food loss and waste in the supply chain. These innovative solutions not only ensure efficient food distribution but also have a positive impact on both economic growth and environmental sustainability.  Logistical, technical, and financial limitations in harvesting techniques, storage facilities, and refrigeration infrastructure often contribute to significant food loss at the beginning of the supply chain. In an era where nutritious sustenance is urgently required to combat hunger worldwide, these challenges must be mitigated.  However, local farmers are now witnessing transformative changes thanks to advancements in storage technology. Earlier this year, a group of engineers developed a solar-powered cold storage system that allows farmers to retain their harvested produce for longer periods without compromising its quality. By capitalizing on renewable energy sources available in abundance within tropical regions prone to erratic electricity supplies, this innovation improves opportunities for smallholder farmers seeking greater financial security.  Transportation also plays a vital role in minimizing post-harvest losses during transit from farms located far from markets or processing units. Entrepreneurs are introducing sustainable transport methods as alternatives to traditional horse-and-cart or truck transportation. Levitating above traffic congestion with zero emissions while ensuring rapid delivery is now possible using environmentally friendly drone technology.  Moreover, packaging innovations are revolutionizing post-harvest handling practices once considered inadequate for preserving fresh produce effectively. A start-up recently introduced bio-based packaging materials derived from agricultural waste products that significantly extend product shelf life while reducing plastic waste pollution across local markets.  While these developments hold significant promise for improving food security among smallholders and enhancing market access, they also contribute to minimizing food waste and reducing the environmental impact of our food systems.  In developed nations, where inefficiencies lie more in consumer behavior and supply chain management, initiatives are emerging to address food waste at the retail level. Supermarkets have joined hands with innovative start-ups to tackle the challenge head-on by repurposing unsold or near-expiry products into meals for communities facing nutritional vulnerabilities. Through this collaboration, not only is excess waste prevented from entering landfills but also a sense of social responsibility is nurtured within local communities.  Moreover, technological advancements offer sophisticated solutions that empower consumers in tracking expiration dates and optimal storage conditions through smartphone applications. By harnessing these tools, individuals can make more informed choices during grocery shopping while significantly reducing waste at home.  The global goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030 set forth in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has gained renewed momentum thanks to these transformative developments. Government agencies worldwide are implementing policies that encourage investment in sustainable agricultural practices while driving progress towards achieving zero hunger.  As we navigate an era marked by increasing climate change-induced disruptions to our existing food systems, it is imperative that we continue investing in innovations that reduce both food loss and waste across all stages of the supply chain. The strategic alignment of public initiatives with private sector expertise promises a future where efficient distribution networks ensure access to nutritious sustenance for all while simultaneously advancing environmental sustainability.  In conclusion, as we witness groundbreaking advancements aimed at revolutionizing how we produce and distribute food globally, it becomes evident that innovating our way out of the challenges posed by inefficient supply chains holds immense potential. These transformative solutions go beyond economic growth alone; they represent a significant step forward toward building inclusive societies founded on principles of sustainability – benefiting future generations as well as our planet's fragile ecosystems.  ###  Note: This article adheres to the writing style commonly found in Credit Suisse Bulletin articles - combining sophistication with accessibility, using plain language in a straightforward manner.",create
"Social Networks: A Driving Force behind Political Activism  In recent years, social networks have emerged as powerful tools for political engagement and activism. The ability to connect with like-minded individuals and share information quickly and globally has revolutionized the way people organize and mobilize for political causes. From the Arab Spring to the Black Lives Matter movement, social networks have played a pivotal role in shaping political landscapes around the world.  One of the key reasons behind the success of social networks as facilitators of political change is their capacity to bring together individuals who may have diverse interests but share a common goal. As renowned economist Laura Tyson points out, these platforms enable connections among people who may otherwise have little in common but are united by their desire for societal transformation.  It is evident that various factors contribute to creating an environment ripe for revolutionary upsurge - youth unemployment, escalating food problems, corrupt regimes, lack of succession plans, widening inequality, and high levels of poverty. These conditions lay the groundwork for popular uprisings waiting to happen. However, it is through social networks that individuals can realize their shared frustrations and aspirations.  Consider a recent example from closer home – Mexico. Over recent years, Mexico has experienced widespread corruption issues within its government institutions leading to disillusionment among its citizens. Frustrated by this pervasive problem plaguing all walks of life in Mexico; citizens took matters into their own hands by leveraging social networks as organizing tools.  One inspiring movement that emerged from this collective frustration centers around transparency and accountability within government services. Citizens connected through online platforms devoted themselves to exposing corruption scandals at different levels: from local bureaucratic offices manipulating public funds to higher echelons involved in elaborate embezzlement schemes.  What started initially as isolated online discussions quickly grew into a powerful nationwide force demanding change at every level of governance - sparking investigations led by independent journalists while simultaneously putting pressure on legislative bodies across state lines.  The impact was tangible; corrupt officials were held accountable, and the importance of transparency in public service culture became a rallying cry. The movement's success can be attributed to the power of social networks to harness individual grievances, allowing participants from different backgrounds to unite under a common cause.  Similar narratives can be seen unfolding across various countries where social networks have become essential tools for organizing political protests and disseminating critical information. From Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement, fighting for democratic rights, to India's farmers' protests against contentious agricultural reforms; these movements owe their resilience and effectiveness to the expansive reach and connectivity provided by social networks.  The democratization of information facilitated by these platforms has empowered individuals who may have previously felt disenfranchised or excluded from political discussions. By granting them access to real-time updates, grassroots movements gain traction and push governments into recalibrating policies that directly impact their constituents.  As we move forward in an increasingly digitized world, recognizing the potential of social networks as catalysts for political change is crucial. Institutions like Credit Suisse must stay attuned to these transformations while exploring ways they can support positive civic engagement made possible through online platforms.  Social networks are no longer just platforms for sharing vacation photos or cute pet videos; they are shaping contemporary politics with dramatic effects. By facilitating connections between people with disparate interests but common ideals, they provide the impetus needed to effect meaningful change on a global scale – reminding us that behind every revolution lies not just an idea but also people willing to take action together.",create

""We believe in actively contributing towards a resilient economy,"" said Caamaño. By fostering innovation and investing in human capital development through initiatives such as vocational training schemes and scholarships, Credit Suisse aims to empower individuals for tomorrow's job market.  While critics argue about potential drawbacks associated with implementing these reforms - from affordability concerns to intergenerational fairness - experts stress that proactive measures can reduce risks while mitigating unintended consequences.  As this debate continues to evolve over the coming months and years leading up to implementation of the reform provisions in Pensions 2020, it is essential for all stakeholders involved to consider an approach that focuses on sustainability without compromising social welfare commitments.  The Pensions 2020 reform remains an essential element of Switzerland's economic future. As experts rally around aligning benefits with financial means and improving educational opportunities for all citizens, there is growing optimism that this transformative phase will pave the way for a sustainable retirement system capable of weathering economic uncertainties while ensuring prosperity for generations yet unborn.",create
"Vinyl Sustains its Resurgence with Nostalgic Gen Z Music Lovers  For decades, music enthusiasts have witnessed the cycles of music formats come and go. From the vinyl records adored by previous generations to the digital revolution dominated by compact discs, each format has had its moment in the spotlight. However, in a seemingly nostalgic resurgence, vinyl records have once again captured the hearts of music lovers worldwide.  In recent years, scholars and journalists alike have attributed this resurgence to an increasing desire for physicality and craftsmanship. Vinyl's tactile quality adds a unique experience that cannot be replicated through streaming services or even CDs. With each crackle of the needle hitting the groove, listeners find a deep connection to their favorite artists. It's no wonder that vinyl sales are experiencing remarkable growth year after year.  But what makes this vinyl revival truly fascinating is its appeal amongst Generation Z—the demographic group known mainly for growing up in a technologically advanced era with streaming services as their primary source of musical consumption. Despite being born into an age where digital platforms reign supreme, these young music lovers are increasingly turning to vinyl records as a way to connect with both older classics and new releases.

By embracing vintage technologies such as record players and vinyl collections, Gen Zers foster a sense of uniqueness within mass consumerism—a rebellion against the homogeneity brought about by algorithms on streaming platforms.  Moreover, this generational shift towards analog media signifies an intriguing cultural shift among younger demographics who crave authenticity more than ever before. Vinyl records demand active listening—they require one's undivided attention from start to finish—an experience remote control-induced shuffle playlists cannot offer.  Record stores once considered relics from another time are now thriving once more thanks to these young audiophiles. In many cities around the world, independent record stores have become community hubs that facilitate live music performances, vinyl listening sessions, and even educational workshops on the art of vinyl collection. It's a testament to the power of nostalgia and the resilience of physical media.  With major artists now releasing new albums on vinyl alongside digital formats, the future looks promising for these old-school discs. Music labels recognize that a significant number of their target audience actively seeks out physical copies precisely because they want to make a deeper connection with their favorite musicians.  However, industry experts caution against viewing this resurgence as a threat to digital streaming platforms. Streaming services still cater to vast audiences seeking convenience and access to an endless library at their fingertips. Instead, vinyl's renaissance represents an alternative market—a niche within the broader music industry—providing artists with additional revenue streams while engaging with fans who crave a more tangible musical experience.  As we enter an era dominated by technology and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, it is intriguing how Generation Z bucks conventional trends by embracing relics from eras long gone by. Whether it's fashion or recreation or music consumption habits like turning back time towards analog technology such as vinyl records – Gen Z continues to redefine cultural norms.  So let us celebrate this remarkable resurrection of an iconic format—vinyl records are back in vogue! They stand as testimony to our enduring desire for authentic experiences amidst an increasingly digital world. ",create

"Argentina's Economic Crisis Deepens as Foreign Reserves Hit Record Lows  Buenos Aires, Argentina - As the financial turmoil in Argentina intensifies, the country finds itself at a critical juncture once again. Faced with rapidly dwindling foreign reserves, Argentine officials have resorted to drastic measures to prevent an all-out collapse of their currency. The peso has experienced its most significant single-day devaluation since the 2002 financial crisis, plummeting 20 percent against the dollar since the beginning of this year.  This intentional devaluation came at a high cost for Argentines, who have been grappling with eroding purchasing power due to soaring inflation rates. The sudden dive in currency value further eroded consumers' ability to afford basic necessities like food and medicine. And yet, despite these harsh realities on the ground, there are signs that this desperate move may be having some potentially positive effects.  Experts from Credit Suisse suggest that while Argentines may be feeling the immediate pain of their government's actions through reduced purchasing power and increased costs of imported goods, there is a silver lining amid Argentina's economic storm clouds. The rapid slide in value seems to have achieved its desired outcome: slowing down the alarming pace at which foreign reserves were being drained away.  Argentina has been struggling with declining foreign reserves for several years now due to persistent fiscal deficits and capital flight out of the country. These reserves act as a safety net for any nation facing economic uncertainties or sudden shocks. However, Argentina's reserves had hit record lows recently before this latest intervention spooked investors into reconsidering their withdrawal plans.  In addition to stabilizing forex losses by curbing capital flight and discouraging imports through weakened purchasing power abroad, policymakers are also leveraging rising interest rates as an effective tool for mopping up excess liquidity within domestic markets. While these measures provide temporary relief and offer somewhat optimistic indicators on paper – such as stabilized exchange rates – experts at Credit Suisse caution that more comprehensive solutions are necessary to address the underlying structural issues.  ""The Argentine government must tackle its fiscal deficit head-on,"" warns Luis Martinez, an economist at Credit Suisse. ""While devaluation provides a short-term boost and some breathing room, it is imperative that policymakers implement substantial reforms in order to restore investors' confidence and attract foreign direct investment.""  Although the current approach may have temporarily stemmed the tide of capital flight, global market dynamics remain volatile, with geopolitical tensions and trade wars casting a dark shadow over emerging markets like Argentina. The country's reliance on external financing further exacerbates these risks since ongoing debts need to be refinanced amid mounting uncertainty.  As analysts closely monitor Argentina's economic crisis, it becomes paramount for policymakers to strike a delicate balance between stabilizing their currency and creating an attractive investment climate. Failure to address both these fronts could lead Argentina into a downward spiral of even more severe financial turmoil.  Given the grave challenges facing Argentina's economy today, this unfolding crisis offers investors two distinct paths: one fraught with continued risks but holding potential rewards if managed adeptly or another leading towards deeper economic distress. Only time will tell which path Argentina chooses as it grapples with critical decisions that could define its economic landscape for years to come.  Despite this grim outlook, hope remains that Argentine officials will seize this moment as an opportunity for transformational change. With concerted efforts aimed at reducing fiscal deficits by cutting public spending and adopting market-friendly policies while addressing social inequalities through targeted welfare programs, Argentina may yet break free from the cycle of recurring crises.  The world now watches attentively as Buenos Aires navigates treacherous waters in search of sustainable growth and stability - not only for its own sake but also as a test case for other nations grappling with similar struggles.",create
"EU Nations Struggle to Reach Consensus on Future Border Expansion  The European Union (EU) finds itself at a critical juncture as member states grapple with the challenges of determining the organization's future borders. With the expansion of cooperation and institutions, it is crucial for the EU to define its content and organizational structure before considering any new member states. This process requires meticulous planning and careful consideration of various factors that will shape Europe's boundaries.  At present, the EU operates under what is commonly known as the ""Copenhagen criteria."" These criteria serve as a benchmark for aspiring countries seeking EU membership, ensuring they meet specific standards related to democracy, rule of law, human rights protection, and functioning market economies. However, defining geographical limits remains a contentious issue among member states.  The process begins with an applicant country expressing its desire to join the EU. Once this formal request is received by Brussels, negotiations begin between EU officials and representatives from the aspiring nation. The negotiating framework detailing terms for accession talks must be agreed upon before negotiations can commence.  Recent debate has centered around potential candidates such as Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey – countries that have expressed interest in joining the bloc in recent years. However, existing member states find themselves divided on how best to move forward with these aspirations.  One faction supports swift expansion into these territories based on historical ties or geopolitical considerations. They argue that embracing new members would strengthen economic ties within Europe while enhancing stability in neighboring regions—a sentiment echoed by several eastern European nations who successfully joined after overcoming significant political and social challenges.  On the other hand, there are concerns about potential strains on existing resources within already-established member states if expansion occurs too rapidly or without adequate preparation. Skeptics highlight issues such as migrant integration challenges experienced during previous Eastern European enlargements or economic disparities between older members like Germany or France versus newly emerging economies in Eastern Europe.  Furthermore ,Brexit has further complicated matters. The United Kingdom's departure from the EU has left an indelible mark on the institution, forcing all member states to reflect on existing dynamics and reassess future strategies. This reflection has sparked an ongoing internal debate about the scope and pace of EU expansion.  With no clear consensus emerging, EU leaders are under increasing pressure to find a way forward that caters to national interests while maintaining cohesion within the bloc. As such, discussions have intensified, and compromise is now seen as key in reaching a mutually agreeable solution.  In addition to geopolitical considerations, economic factors also play a significant role in determining Europe's future borders. The potential benefits of market integration across regions must be weighed against potential challenges arising from differing levels of economic development or industrial sectors at risk due to competition.  As negotiations continue behind closed doors, experts believe that striking a balance between caution and ambition will be crucial in defining the EU's geographical limits. Delicate diplomacy will be required to manage competing interests effectively while ensuring new members can meet the high standards expected within the union.  Ultimately, whatever decision is reached regarding future border expansion will shape Europe's political landscape for years to come. As we navigate uncertain times filled with global challenges, it is imperative that European leaders work together in determining Europe's path forward—a path where unity and cooperation prevail over division and discord among nations.  Only time will tell whether these deliberations lead to greater inclusivity or if caution prevails amidst concerns about preserving what has been built thus far. With so much at stake for both current member states and aspiring countries seeking membership, finding common ground remains paramount—ensuring that any future decisions align with Credit Suisse Bulletin’s values of creativity , effectiveness , performance-driven approach",create

""A couple of years prior to that, I had set up my own business importing sporting goods from Asia,"" Felder recalls. ""The opportunity then arose to invest in a bicycle factory in Bulgaria - and I grabbed the bull by the horns.""  Felder is one of many international investors who recognized the potential within Bulgaria's changing economic landscape. While there were significant hurdles to overcome initially, such as corruption and an extensive gray economy overshadowing legitimate business operations, this period also signaled a new direction for the country.  ""Chaotic,"" Felder describes it. ""The mafia were also rampant. The gray economy was bigger than the 'regular' economy."" However, amidst these challenges lay immense opportunities waiting to be tapped into.  Fast forward to today; Sofia, Bulgaria's capital city, is thriving with startups and businesses focused on cutting-edge technologies.

"Emerging Markets Find Solace in Technological Innovation Amidst Global Crisis  In the face of a global economic slowdown that has left no region unscathed, emerging market economies have been grappling with challenges triggered by the moderation in international financial flows and plummeting commodity prices. However, these adverse conditions have driven these nations to explore new avenues for growth, including a significant emphasis on technological innovation.  Eric Varvel, CEO of Credit Suisse's Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region noted that emerging markets have been hit hard by the ongoing global slump. The demand for their exports has dwindled as consumers around the world tighten their belts amidst uncertainty. Compounding this issue is a sudden drop in credit flow from major economies such as the United States, Europe, and Japan to emerging markets. Furthermore, an abrupt decline in prices for their primary exports has further compromised economic stability.  While these circumstances may seem dire at first glance, they have catalyzed an unexpected surge in technological innovation across many emerging market economies. Faced with declining export revenues and weak credit inflows from traditional sources, countries such as Brazil, India, China (commonly referred to as BRIC nations), along with other developing nations like South Korea and Malaysia are actively pursuing strategies focused on leveraging technology-driven sectors to bolster their economies.  Notably among these innovative efforts is Brazil's push towards digital transformation within its agricultural sector. The country understands its potential competitive advantage lies not solely in being one of the largest agricultural producers globally but in harnessing cutting-edge technologies to enhance productivity and sustainability within this crucial sector.  With climate change casting its shadow over global agriculture systems and raising concerns about food security worldwide - leveraging advancements such as precision farming techniques can significantly increase yield while minimizing resource wastage. By adopting state-of-the-art sensors equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities combined with satellite imagery harbingering weather forecasts - farmers gain unprecedented insights into soil health conditions or pest outbreaks, enabling them to take immediate and targeted actions.  India, in its bid to diversify its service-oriented economy and close the socio-economic divide, has been making significant strides in financial technology (fintech). The country's young population's innate tech-savviness coupled with governmental support for digital payments has led to a monumental rise in fintech startups. They focus on easing access to financial services hitherto unattainable by vast swathes of the population residing in rural areas. By leveraging mobile banking apps and cashless payment solutions, millions now have access to insurance coverage, microloans for entrepreneurial pursuits or educational resources.  In China, already known as a global powerhouse driving technological innovations across sectors such as e-commerce and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a renewed emphasis on green technologies - underpinned by their ambitious carbon neutrality goals. From electric vehicles revolutionizing transportation systems to renewable energy harnessing sources like solar farms; China understands that investing in sustainable technologies will help secure long-term economic growth while mitigating climate risks.  Emerging market economies are not alone in this technological evolution. Other nations such as South Korea - renowned for its electronics industry - continue capitalizing on their strengths while simultaneously venturing into emerging fields like 5G connectivity or biotechnology research.  Amidst the uncertainty caused by the ongoing global crisis, these innovative approaches adopted by emerging markets offer glimpses of hope. By tapping into their inherent entrepreneurial spirit and embracing cutting-edge technologies – countries are navigating through these stormy economic waters with determination.  As Eric Varvel suggests: ""While traditional economic indicators paint a grim picture for emerging markets today, we must recognize the immense potential that lies within technological innovation. It is vital for investors around the world not to overlook these exciting developments.""  Indeed, amidst global turmoil lies an opportunity for emerging economies to redefine themselves through technology-driven progress – representing an inspiring narrative where resilience prevails over adversity.",create
"The Rise of India's Startup Ecosystem  India's impressive economic growth has been well-documented, with a booming population and a GDP that has been soaring at an average of 7.2 percent per year. However, there is another exciting story emerging from the Indian subcontinent that is captivating the global business community - the rise of India's startup ecosystem.  In recent years, India has witnessed an unprecedented surge in entrepreneurial activity. Young, dynamic minds are seizing opportunities to turn their innovative ideas into game-changing businesses. Just a few decades ago, entrepreneurship was considered risky and unconventional in this country. Today, it is celebrated as a viable career choice and a key driver of economic growth.  India's transformation into one of the world's leading startup hubs can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost is its vast talent pool. With over 1.2 billion people, India boasts an enormous base of young and educated individuals hungry for success. This talent pool brims with engineers, designers, data scientists, marketers - all armed with dreams to disrupt traditional industries and make their mark on the world stage.  Secondly, favorable government policies have played a significant role in nurturing this entrepreneurial boom. Recognizing the potential employment opportunities offered by startups and their contribution to national development, the Indian government launched initiatives like ""Startup India"" in 2016 to provide tax benefits and regulatory support for new ventures.  One particularly exciting aspect of India's startup ecosystem is its focus on technology-driven innovation. While cities like Bengaluru (often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India) have been at the forefront for many years now, there has been tremendous growth seen across other major cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi as well.  Startups operating within sectors such as e-commerce, fintech (financial technology), edtech (education technology), healthtech (healthcare technology), agritech (agriculture technology), transport tech are witnessing exponential growth levels, attracting massive investments from venture capitalists, both domestic and international.  However, it's not just about the capital pouring in. India's startup ecosystem is also benefiting from a strong network of incubators and accelerators that provide infrastructure support, mentorship, and access to investors. Institutions such as IIM Ahmedabad's Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) are fostering the growth of promising startups by providing a conducive environment for these young entrepreneurs to thrive.  One standout success story is that of Flipkart, an e-commerce platform founded in 2007 which has revolutionized the way Indians shop online. Flipkart grew rapidly to become one of India's most valuable startups before being acquired by Walmart in 2018. This acquisition raised international eyebrows and signaled India's arrival on the global stage as a force to be reckoned with in terms of entrepreneurship.  While there is much cause for celebration in India's startup scene, challenges remain. A skilled labor shortage coupled with regulatory roadblocks can hamper progress if not appropriately addressed. However, policymakers are working tirelessly towards removing these hurdles by focusing on skill development programs and ease of doing business reforms.  India has come a long way since independence, but its journey towards becoming an entrepreneurial powerhouse has only just begun. With continued government support and an unwavering spirit of innovation among its people, this vibrant nation is poised to make even deeper imprints on global business landscapes.  The world will be eagerly watching as these Indian startups break barriers and conquer new frontiers - putting faces to the charts and figures that show not just economic growth but also human ambition unfolding right before our eyes.

"The Chinese Consumer: Powering the Global Luxury Market  In a stunning turn of events, the Chinese consumer market has exceeded all predictions and now stands as the world's second-largest consumer market, surpassing Italy. This unexpected growth has sparked renewed excitement and confidence in China's economic prowess, signaling a promising future for both domestic and international businesses.  Experts are attributing this remarkable shift to two key factors: robust economic growth averaging at an impressive ten percent annually and an increasingly skewed income distribution that favors the affluent. As these factors combine forces, they propel the upper echelons of society into unprecedented wealth accumulation.  Credit Suisse analysts believe that this rapid transformation will undoubtedly revolutionize global markets – particularly in the luxury sector. The rise of China's affluent class is fueling consumption patterns never seen before, with high-end brands clamoring to meet their demand for luxury goods and services.  According to recent research by Credit Suisse experts, Chinese consumers already account for a staggering one-third of global spending on personal luxury items such as fashion accessories, watches, jewelry, and premium cosmetics. With their insatiable appetite for opulence only growing stronger year after year, it is predicted that by 2025 China alone will contribute close to half of worldwide luxury purchases.  To better understand this phenomenon and its socio-economic implications worldwide requires exploring how China managed such exponential growth within their consumer base. Historically known as a country with strong savings habits deeply engrained in its cultural fabric, China has now pivoted towards driving consumption-led growth.  This shift is propelled by several catalysts working in tandem:  1. Expanding Middle Class: The rapid urbanization rate has led to an expanding middle class seeking better lifestyles characterized by high-quality products and experiences previously reserved only for elites. 2. E-commerce Revolution: Technological advancements have transformed online shopping into a convenient avenue for consumers nationwide where they can explore a vast array of products from both local brands and international luxury icons. 3. Social Media Influence: Chinese consumers are heavily influenced by social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Xiaohongshu, which enable them to discover new trends and connect directly with brands.  These factors have revolutionized the retail landscape in China. To thrive in this evolving market, both domestic and international companies need to adapt their strategies by fully embracing digital channels. Harnessing the power of e-commerce and leveraging social media platforms will be crucial for success.  The impact of China's consumer market expansion extends far beyond its borders. The global luxury industry has already experienced a paradigm shift as it increasingly caters to Chinese consumers' discerning tastes and aspirations. High-end fashion houses are not only adapting their designs but also establishing strong brand presence within the country through flagship stores showcasing exclusivity.  Moreover, industries closely tied to luxury consumption, such as tourism and hospitality, are adjusting their offerings to accommodate this new wave of Chinese travelers seeking unique experiences around the globe.  As we delve deeper into this phenomenon shaping our economic landscape, experts affirm that businesses unable or unwilling to tap into the vast potential offered by China's affluent consumers face significant risks of being left behind. The ability to understand their preferences and provide personalized experiences will be key in securing growth opportunities across various sectors globally.  In conclusion, the rise of the Chinese consumer market has surpassed all expectations while defying traditional economic assumptions. This seismic shift presents immense possibilities for businesses worldwide who can align themselves with China's changing consumption patterns. As we witness this monumental transformation unravel before our eyes – reshaping both domestic economies and global markets – one thing is clear: those who dare underestimate its potential do so at their own peril.

"The Exponential Rise of Fintech Startups: A Threat or an Opportunity for Swiss Banks?  In recent years, Switzerland has witnessed a surge in the number of fintech startups disrupting the traditional banking landscape. These agile and innovative technology-driven companies are challenging the status quo, offering a range of digital financial services that appeal to tech-savvy consumers. As their popularity grows, questions arise regarding their impact on established institutions such as Credit Suisse and UBS.  Fintech startups have gained significant traction by leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence to streamline and democratize financial services. They offer everything from peer-to-peer lending platforms to digital wealth management solutions, all accessible with a few taps on a smartphone. This convenience is attracting an increasingly large customer base that seeks quick, affordable, and user-friendly alternatives to traditional banking.  However, this rise in fintech startups has raised concerns about the future of Switzerland's big banks. Will they be left behind by these nimble newcomers? Or can they harness their experience, resources, and trusted reputation to compete effectively in this rapidly evolving landscape?  Experts suggest that it is not a matter of one displacing the other entirely; rather, it is about finding synergy between established players and nimble newcomers. The big banks possess invaluable strengths like extensive networks, robust regulatory compliance frameworks built over decades, deep industry knowledge,and access to substantial reserves of capital.  To stay relevant amidst rapid innovation in financial technology (fintech), both Credit Suisse and UBS have embraced partnerships with fintech startups themselves through programs like incubators or accelerators. By collaborating with these smaller companies at an early stage rather than viewing them solely as competitors,the big banks aim to benefit mutually from shared knowledge,pooling strengths,respective client bases,and expanding technological capabilities.  Moreover,the big banks are investing heavily in digital transformation initiatives internally,to enhance operational efficiency ,provide seamless omnichannel experiences across various touchpoints,and adapt to changing customer behaviors in a digital-first world. For instance, Credit Suisse has launched its Digital Private Bank, integrating innovative tools and personalized advice to cater to the needs of wealth management clients.  Additionally,the established banks can leverage their strong brand recognition and client trust that come with years of experience. In an industry where trust is paramount, customers often feel more comfortable entrusting their financial matters to institutions with a long-standing track record rather than unproven startups.  Furthermore, Switzerland's banking institutions are highly regulated and subject to stringent compliance standards. This regulatory environment acts as a barrier for many fintech companies seeking market entry,making collaboration with established banks an attractive proposition for both sides (Subject-Verb agreement). By working together, they can navigate complex regulatory landscapes while leveraging the agility of fintech startups,to embrace new technologies safely.  However,this collaboration does not come without challenges.For big banks like Credit Suisse and UBS, embracing fintech innovations requires overcoming bureaucratic hurdles,and adapting long-standing cultural habits.These behemoths need to instilla culture of agility within their organizations,fostering experimentation,welcoming new ideas,and being open-minded towards disruptive innovations (There is a space required after comma).  Ultimately,the expansion of fintech startups poses both threats and opportunities for Credit Suisse ,UBS ,and other major Swiss banks.It would be shortsighted for these incumbents to ignore or dismiss technological advancements.Resistancecould lead them down the path taken by iconic companies like Kodak or Blockbuster that failedto adapt.But by marrying the expertiseand resources of traditional bankingwiththe dynamism (comma needed)and innovation offered byfintech disruptors,Swissbankscan position themselves at the forefrontnof the digital revolutionin finance.

"As Central Banks Diverge, So Might the Art Market  Parting doesn't always have to be sweet sorrow, especially when it comes to monetary policy divergence. While the world's largest central banks prepare for tightening, a different asset class is poised for relative outperformance – the art market. As economic shifts lead to varying investment strategies, art collectors and investors are finding refuge in this alternative asset class.  Art has long been considered a haven during times of financial uncertainty or inflationary pressures. This time is no different. With inflation concerns on the rise and central banks taking divergent paths towards monetary policy normalization, art market participants are eyeing potential gains in value.  Credit Suisse's Chief Investment Officer for the UK, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region's Private Banking & Wealth Management division, Michael O'Sullivan believes that as central banks tighten their policies globally, assets like equities could face headwinds due to higher interest rates and potentially slower economic growth. This scenario prompts investors to seek alternative investments that can shield their portfolios from such impacts.  The current dynamics of the global business cycle also support O'Sullivan's prediction of a more supportive environment for the art market in the second half of this year. As economies gradually recover from pandemic-induced recessions, governments worldwide are injecting massive stimulus packages into their economies. These actions are likely to stimulate consumer spending and support demand for luxury goods such as high-end artwork.  Art investment has historically shown resilience during times of economic turmoil due to its unique characteristics – limited supply compared to growing demand and low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks or bonds.  Sophia Hernandez-Sanchez, an art advisor based in New York City who works closely with Credit Suisse clients interested in diversifying their holdings into art assets says ""Investors understand that bearing physical ownership of an artwork with intrinsic value provides psychological comfort amidst a volatile financial landscape.""  The recent surge in interest from institutional investors adds further credibility to the art market's growing attraction. With central bank policies creating an uncertain investment environment, institutional investors are allocating more funds towards alternatives like art, seeking uncorrelated returns and portfolio diversification.  Furthermore, technology has played a pivotal role in broadening access to the art market for all types of investors. Online auction platforms and digital asset management services have disrupted traditional market dynamics by providing a seamless experience for buying and selling artwork. This democratization of access has attracted a new generation of tech-savvy collectors eager to invest in tangible assets with potential long-term value.  While art offers unique investment characteristics, it is important to note that investing in this asset class requires specialized expertise. Artworks' valuation, provenance verification, authenticity checks, and in-depth knowledge of individual artists or genres are critical components when building an art-focused investment strategy.  Credit Suisse acknowledges the importance of this expertise within its offering by providing clients with access to a network of experienced advisors who can guide their decision-making processes. Art-focused educational programs are also being organized to cater to clients keen on understanding the intricacies involved in investing within this space.  As central banks continue to diverge on monetary policy decisions worldwide, astute investors are exploring alternative investments that can hedge against potential risks arising from these shifts. The allure of the art market lies not only in its historical resilience but also its capacity to deliver uncorrelated returns and diversify portfolios effectively during periods marked by financial uncertainty.  With economic forecasts pointing towards steady recovery combined with expanding technological advancements facilitating broader participation, it seems like the world may witness even greater appreciation for artistic masterpieces both within galleries and diversified investment portfolios alike.",create
"The Champion's Elixir: An Unconventional Training Method Boosts Performance and Recovery  It must have been a triumphant moment when Serena Williams, the reigning tennis superstar, stepped onto the court at Wimbledon after months of intense training and preparation. The grass courts gleamed under the summer sun as she glided across them, displaying her impeccable skills and claiming victory once again. Behind her success lies an untold secret – an unconventional training method that has revolutionized the way athletes approach their performance and recovery.  Dubbed ""The Champion's Elixir,"" this extraordinary elixir allegedly holds the key to unlocking peak physical performance while accelerating recovery time. The elixir is said to be a concoction of all-natural ingredients meticulously gathered from exotic locales around the world.  Athletes who have incorporated this elixir into their training regimen claim remarkable improvements in stamina, focus, and overall well-being. It is rumored that Roger Federer himself experimented with this elixir before his record-breaking return to dominance last year.  But what exactly does The Champion's Elixir contain? While its precise recipe remains shrouded in secrecy, insiders whisper about rare herbs from the Amazon rainforest reputed for their energy-enhancing properties. Others speculate that there are potent antioxidants sourced from remote corners of Asia known for promoting longevity and rejuvenation.  Experts argue that The Champion's Elixir goes beyond mere hydration or replenishment – it taps into ancient wisdom passed down through generations. These ancient practices supposedly harness hidden energies within our bodies while harmonizing mind, body, and spirit.  Sports scientists worldwide are both fascinated by these claims yet skeptical about its efficacy. Driven by curiosity to unearth scientific truths behind this apparent miracle worker aiding sports professionals globally to reach new heights, researchers at esteemed institutions such as Harvard Medical School have initiated investigations into its potential benefits.  ""It is fascinating how such unconventional techniques can yield significant results,"" commented Dr. Jessica Collins from Harvard's Sports Science Department. ""While we cannot ignore the placebo effect, we have to acknowledge that there might be something more to this elixir.""  Athletes who swear by The Champion's Elixir believe it not only enhances their physical performance but also aids in mental fortitude and resilience. They claim that its unique blend nourishes their bodies on a cellular level, reducing inflammation and speeding up recovery from intense training sessions.  However, skeptics raise concerns about the lack of rigorous scientific evidence supporting these claims. Without comprehensive clinical trials or peer-reviewed studies, some argue it is merely a marketing ploy capitalizing on athletes' desperation for a competitive edge.  Aware of the controversy surrounding The Champion's Elixir, Credit Suisse Bulletin spoke with renowned nutritionist Dr. Lisa Mitchell for her expert opinion.  ""While I understand the skepticism surrounding unconventional methods and unverified claims,"" Dr. Mitchell explained, ""it is important not to discard potential breakthroughs outright."" She encouraged researchers to conduct rigorous studies investigating both short-term performance improvements as well as any long-term health effects that may arise from consistent use of such elixirs.  As with any revolutionary breakthrough in sports science, it will take time and exhaustive research to truly assess the effectiveness of The Champion's Elixir. Until then, athletes worldwide continue to explore alternative methods for reaching peak performance while seeking new boundaries yet unimagined.  Whether one believes in its mystical properties or labels it as mere myth-making hype – The Champion's Elixir has undeniably intrigued professionals across various disciplines within the sporting world. As curiosity grows and investigations unfold into this enigmatic concoction, one question remains: can an ancient elixir truly unlock limitless potential within modern-day champions?",create
"Switzerland Embraces Sustainable Finance to Drive Economic Growth  As the Swiss super cycle comes to an end, Switzerland is seeking new avenues for economic growth and stability. With the slowdown in residential property growth and a decline in net immigration, the country is now turning its focus towards sustainable finance as a key driver of future prosperity.  In recent years, Switzerland has developed a reputation as a global leader in sustainable finance. The financial sector has recognized the importance of integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions, leading to increased demand for sustainable investments. This trend has been driven by both institutional investors who are embracing responsible investing principles and individual investors who are growing more conscious of their impact on society and the environment.  The Swiss government has been actively supporting this shift towards sustainable finance by implementing policies that encourage companies to adopt ESG practices. In 2015, it introduced guidelines that require pension funds to disclose how they consider sustainability factors in their investment strategies. Additionally, regulators have been promoting transparency by encouraging companies listed on the Swiss stock exchange to disclose their ESG risks and opportunities.  These initiatives have not only attracted international investors but have also positioned Switzerland as a hub for sustainability-focused business activities. The country's expertise in fields such as clean energy technology, water management systems, and biodiversity conservation has led to the emergence of innovative startups working towards providing sustainable solutions.  To further stimulate growth in this sector, Switzerland has also established various public-private partnerships aimed at supporting sustainable infrastructure projects. For instance, the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM) collaborates with private equity funds investing in renewable energy projects across developing countries. Such initiatives not only contribute to global efforts towards mitigating climate change but also provide attractive investment opportunities for Swiss financial institutions.  With its strong commitment to sustainability and well-developed financial infrastructure, Switzerland is well-positioned to become a leading center for green bonds issuance - an increasingly popular form of financing for sustainable projects. These bonds allow investors to support projects with positive environmental and social impacts while generating financial returns. By creating a favorable regulatory environment, Switzerland can attract more green bond issuers, thereby stimulating the growth of this market segment.  In addition to sustainable finance's potential economic benefits, it also aligns with Switzerland's long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. The country is known for its clean and pristine landscapes, and maintaining these natural assets is crucial for its economy as well as its residents' quality of life. By investing in sustainable initiatives both domestically and abroad, Switzerland aims to balance economic development with preserving the environment for future generations.  The transition towards a sustainable finance model does come with challenges. It requires close collaboration between financial institutions, regulators, and corporations to set clear standards and metrics by which sustainability can be evaluated accurately. Moreover, constantly evolving consumer preferences necessitate ongoing innovation within the sector.  Nevertheless, Switzerland has already proven itself adept at adapting to new opportunities while maintaining its position at the forefront of global finance. Through embracing sustainable finance practices and capitalizing on its established expertise in this field, Switzerland is well-equipped to navigate the post-super cycle era successfully.  As global interest in responsible investing continues to grow unabatedly, Swiss financial institutions have an opportunity not only to generate substantial returns but also make a significant positive impact on society and the environment.

"2022: The Resurgence of the Euro   In recent years, the dominant position of the US dollar has been unquestionable. Historically, periods of higher interest rates have been closely tied to the strength of the greenback. However, as we enter 2022, financial experts are now pointing towards a potential shift in global currency dynamics. The Credit Suisse Bulletin investigates a growing trend that suggests the euro could be on track for a resounding comeback.  Throughout 2014, despite fluctuations in value, analysts noted that there was an underlying pattern regarding the US dollar's performance. Similarly today, Credit Suisse's foreign exchange analysts project that there may be an upward trajectory for another currency – this time it's none other than Europe's very own euro.  While previous predictions have suggested that any such change would take place over several years or even decades, recent economic indicators are challenging these assumptions. Central banks across Europe have collectively implemented accommodative monetary policies and fiscal stimulus measures to boost growth within their respective economies due to pandemic-induced challenges.  These synchronized efforts by European countries seem to be paying off sooner than expected. Over the past year alone, despite market volatility and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 recovery efforts worldwide, the euro has demonstrated remarkable resilience and shown signs of becoming increasingly attractive for investors seeking diversification opportunities.  Credit Suisse economists argue that this resurgence stems from Europe's steady recovery from pandemic-induced economic shocks combined with its commitment towards long-term sustainability and digital transformation initiatives. Germany and France continue to drive growth within key industries such as manufacturing and technology sectors respectively while countries like Spain and Italy show significant progress in implementing structural reforms necessary for sustained economic expansion.  In addition to positive economic data emerging from Eurozone nations individually compared against expectations set forth at post-pandemic summits; international investors are drawn by favorable conditions stemming from political stability among core members like France or Italy when contrasted with Brexit uncertainties still surrounding member states outside those borders.  Moreover, the European Union's ambitious strategic investments in renewable energies further bolster confidence in the region's economic prospects. With initiatives like the Green Deal and globally recognized leadership in climate change management, Europe has firmly positioned itself as a global leader committed to sustainable growth.  While it is still too early to make precise forecasts, experts anticipate that this trend could lead to a sustained period of euro strength against major currencies such as the US dollar and British pound. This would undoubtedly impact various sectors including international trade, tourism, financial markets, and investment strategies worldwide.  However, we should remain cautious as obstacles lie ahead on this path towards recovery. The persistent threat of new COVID-19 variants and potential disruptions in vaccine distribution may pose risks not just to Europe but all nations globally. Furthermore, evolving geopolitical dynamics require close attention as they often impact currency relationships significantly.  Nevertheless, Credit Suisse urges investors and market participants alike to keep a watchful eye on these emerging trends surrounding the euro throughout 2022. As history has shown us time and again – predicting currency fluctuations accurately is no easy task yet it remains crucial for informed decision-making when it comes to managing investments effectively amidst ever-changing global landscapes.  In conclusion - if current developments persist or even strengthen over time - 2022 could indeed be remembered as the year of the euro resurgence – an exciting prospect for investors seeking opportunities outside traditional havens like the US dollar domain. Stay tuned for more updates from Credit Suisse Bulletin as we closely monitor these dynamic shifts unfolding before our eyes while keeping financial markets' future implications at heart.",create
"Title: Eurozone Leaders Forge Ahead in Pursuit of Fiscal Union, Bolstering Stability Measures  In a groundbreaking development that could reshape the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU), leaders from across the region have intensified their efforts to reinforce fiscal integration. This strategic move comes as a response to the mounting challenges and uncertainties surrounding the monetary union, aiming to prevent another financial crisis.  Building on existing scenarios outlined in a 2011 report, titled ""Revisiting EMU Scenarios,"" European policymakers have embarked on an ambitious plan to push for further fiscal coordination. The primary objective is to enhance stability and promote sustainable economic growth amongst member states.  The recent initiative has gained significant momentum with key EU leaders rallying behind measures aimed at fortifying monetary cooperation within the EMU. A growing consensus among member states suggests that a collective approach is vital for defending against future economic shocks and ensuring long-term resilience.  Underpinning this new course is a firm resolution not only to contain any potential crisis but also chart a clear trajectory towards improved stabilization within the Eurozone. By addressing debt burdens through prudent reduction strategies and bolstering bank capitalization, authorities seek to restore confidence in troubled economies while simultaneously shielding robust ones from contagion effects.  While challenges persist, such as divergent fiscal policies among member states, eurozone leaders are optimistic about fostering deeper fiscal integration in order to ensure sustainability. The formation of this unified approach will lay groundwork conducive for shared investments toward common goals like infrastructure development, research and innovation advancement, job creation initiatives, and overall economic convergence.  ""The current landscape demands even more efficient collaboration among member states,"" emphasized European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her address at an economics summit today. ""By pooling resources strategically and implementing coherent policies across borders, we can unlock immense growth potential while mitigating risks.""  Although progress towards forming stronger fiscal links gained impetus during difficult times when existential threats loomed over Europe's core institutions, policymakers remain committed to further consolidation. The aim is not only to enhance economic resilience but also fortify the European project itself, demonstrating its ability to adapt and overcome adversity.  The developments mark a notable shift towards acknowledging that fiscal union could aid in cementing the long-term stability of the EMU. Experts argue that this move could bring greater convergence among eurozone countries while minimizing potential future conflicts sparked by economic disparities.  Critics, however, express caution amid concerns over individual nation states relinquishing sovereignty. To address such apprehensions, experts suggest implementing safeguards that protect each member state's unique characteristics and ensure decisions are made collectively and transparently.  As the process unfolds, negotiations center on finding practical methods for harmonizing fiscal policies within diverse economies. Some proposals include aligning national budgets with common fiscal rules, creating an expanded role for institutions like the Eurogroup and Eurozone Treasury to oversee joint decision-making processes effectively.  Nevertheless, any agreement reached will require careful navigation through domestic political landscapes while garnering public support for compromising aspects of national autonomy in exchange for shared prosperity and resilience across borders.  This historic endeavor seeks not only to reestablish trust among investors globally but also inspire confidence domestically. By tackling these challenges head-on amidst a rapidly evolving global landscape defined by technological disruptions and geopolitical shifts, European leaders aim to secure Europe's place as a powerful economic force in an increasingly interconnected world.  While uncertainties persist regarding the timeline for implementing such comprehensive reforms due to intricacies involved in aligning member states' aspirations and interests fully – one thing remains clear: Europe is standing united against future crises with determination forged through collective effort and resolve at its core  Disclaimer: This article is purely fictional and created as an example using OpenAI's language model GPT-3.",create
"A Renoir Revival Is Long Overdue  All of their early works are, of course, tremendously exciting because the Impressionists influenced one another and worked together on much of what they developed. I'd really like to explore Monet's early years at some point too. Because a Renoir revival is long overdue. He hasn't exactly got the greatest reputation because people mostly tend to see his numerous later works, which are fraught with clichés - always women, always nudes, always voluptuous, powdery and pastel-toned.  For me, it was clear that a closer look at Renoir's earlier groundbreaking contributions to Impressionism is in order. And it seems others in the art world agree as well.  Enter ""Renoir: Revealing Impressionism,"" an upcoming exhibition curated by the Credit Suisse Art Foundation in collaboration with world-renowned art historians and curators. This revolutionary showcase aims to shine a spotlight on Renoir's lesser-known masterpieces from his formative years as an artist.  The exhibition will feature over fifty carefully selected paintings from private collections around the globe that have rarely been shown publicly before. Through this collection of artistic gems from various periods of Renoir's career - spanning from his early landscapes and society portraits to genre scenes and interiors - visitors will gain insight into the evolution of his style and contributions to Impressionism as a whole.  One aspect often overlooked in discussions about Renoir is how he revolutionized portraiture during his initial years. Portraits like ""Madame Henriot"" reveal his ability to capture essence rather than mere physical likeness, using vibrant brushwork and bold colors that set him apart from traditional portrait painters at the time.  Another highlight of this exhibition will be Renoir's exploration of everyday life scenes or genre painting; works such as ""Le Moulin de la Galette"" depict boisterous dance hall gatherings with lively brushstrokes and an unparalleled sense of movement. These early pieces perfectly exemplify Renoir's distinctive style, characterized by his fascination with light and fleeting moments.  Not only does ""Renoir: Revealing Impressionism"" seek to redefine our understanding of Renoir's artistic legacy, but it also aims to shed light on the strong connections between him and his Impressionist peers. By juxtaposing Renoir's works with those of Monet, Degas, and others, the exhibition invites viewers to explore the reciprocal nature of their artistic exchanges - a crucial factor that catalyzed the birth of Impressionism itself.  Depicting diverse subjects ranging from landscapes to still life to figure studies, this exhibition demonstrates Renoir's versatility as an artist during a transformative period in art history. It challenges prevalent perceptions rooted in his later years' work and opens avenues for renewed appreciation for his ingenuity within the context of Impressionist art.  ""Renoir: Revealing Impressionism"" is set to captivate audiences worldwide. The Credit Suisse Art Foundation is deeply committed to making this exhibition accessible beyond traditional gallery spaces by utilizing innovative digital platforms and collaborations with major cultural institutions around the globe. Online virtual tours will allow art enthusiasts from all corners of the world to engage with these masterpieces remotely - providing unprecedented access for those who may not have had such an opportunity otherwise.  With ""Renoir: Revealing Impressionism,"" we are presented with a unique chance not only to rediscover one artist but also understand how artists collectively shaped movements in art history through collaboration and dialogue. This groundbreaking exhibition promises not only a revival but a reevaluation of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's immense contribution as an innovator, pioneer, and one of France's greatest painters alongside other esteemed members of the Impressionist movement.  The Credit Suisse Bulletin encourages readers far and wide to mark their calendars for this once-in-a-lifetime event, as it promises to be a captivating journey through the lesser-known chapters of Renoir's artistic journey and an exploration of Impressionism's shared legacy. Stay tuned for more updates on this remarkable exhibition that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",create
"Title: Pandemic Recovery Challenges May Limit Emerging Markets' Performance, Credit Suisse Analysts Say  In the wake of the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging markets (EM) have attracted considerable attention as a potential area of growth for investors. While many experts predict a strong rebound for these economies, analysts at Credit Suisse caution that certain challenges may limit their ability to outperform.  During a recent conference call organized by Credit Suisse's Research Institute, Andrew Garthwaite, the bank's Global Equity Strategist, discussed the factors that could hinder EMs' robustness in today's context. Drawing comparisons to past financial crises in the late 1990s and highlighting positive developments such as reduced foreign currency debt and decreased dependency on currency pegs, Garthwaite highlighted four key aspects often overlooked by observers.  Foremost among these challenges is high private sector leverage within emerging markets. According to Garthwaite's analysis, domestic debt remains a critical issue in many regions. He warns that excessive private sector debt burdens may impede economic growth and stability if not properly managed.  Additionally, Garthwaite pointed out three other significant areas of concern often overshadowed by positive indicators – governance issues, inequality disparities among population segments and regions within emerging market economies, and environmental sustainability risks. While these factors may be less visible at first glance than others examined over time, their long-term impact on EM performance cannot be ignored.  Governance issues pose a particular threat to emerging markets' progress as weak political institutions can undermine policy implementation or create unfavorable investment conditions. Strengthening transparency measures within EM governments will play an essential role in building trust with investors seeking sustainable growth opportunities.  The second challenge involves inequality disparities among different segments and regions within emerging market countries. Socioeconomic gaps can perpetuate instability and hinder inclusive growth initiatives. Addressing income disparities through policies supporting job creation/retention and access to quality education will be crucial for sustainable development in these markets.  The third challenge highlighted by Garthwaite is the increased importance of environmental sustainability and climate change risk. As the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, emerging markets face significant pressure to balance economic growth with sustainable practices. Failure to do so could result in negative environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and increased vulnerability to climate-related disruptions.  While acknowledging these challenges, Garthwaite also identified areas where policy actions could mitigate risks and promote long-term stability within emerging markets. Enhanced regulations ensuring responsible lending practices, greater focus on social welfare programs promoting equality, and investment in sustainable infrastructure were among his recommendations.  As investors explore opportunities in emerging markets, it becomes increasingly important for them to carefully assess risks beyond simple headline figures. The complexities surrounding private sector leverage, governance standards, socio-economic inequalities, and environmental responsibilities demand a comprehensive understanding of each market's unique dynamics.  Credit Suisse continues its commitment towards providing thought leadership on emerging market trends through their rigorous research efforts. As financial institutions navigate post-pandemic uncertainties alongside investors seeking growth potential beyond developed economies, it is vital that expert insight goes hand-in-hand with investment strategies.  Garthwaite's analysis serves as a timely reminder that while emerging markets are attractive investment destinations amid global recovery prospects; they are not without their share of challenges that must be addressed appositely for long-term success.",create
"Title: ""Social Media Influencers Propel New Tech Startups to Unprecedented Heights""  Subtitle: ""How YouTube Sensations Are Dominating the Market and Disrupting Industries""  Byline: John Smith, Financial Analyst and Technology Expert  In recent years, the power of social media has grown exponentially, providing individuals with a unique platform to express themselves and connect with others across the globe. Undoubtedly, this phenomenon has transformed the way we communicate, share information, and even conduct business. Amidst this digital revolution lies a subculture of creative minds harnessing their influence on platforms such as YouTube to propel new tech startups forward.  One standout example is Amanda Carter, a 27-year-old content creator who began her journey on YouTube just five years ago. Having amassed millions of followers with her fashion-forward videos and relatable persona, she has since become an influential figure in the beauty industry.  What sets Amanda apart from traditional celebrities is that while they endorse products from established brands for big bucks, she utilizes her platform as a launchpad for her own ventures. Her most recent endeavor involves creating a line of sustainable cosmetics aimed at eco-conscious consumers. Leveraging her loyal following and expertise gained through years of connecting with fans online, she managed to raise an astonishing $10 million in seed funding within days.  Amanda's success story is not an isolated incident; similar trends have been observed across various industries where social media influencers are stepping into entrepreneurship roles by championing innovative technologies. The ripple effect can be seen throughout numerous sectors – from fintech and healthtech to artificial intelligence (AI) startups – fundamentally reshaping traditional business models.  Experts argue that this disruption comes as no surprise if we consider how seamlessly social media platforms fuse technology with human nature itself; our innate desire for connection fuels both its growth and success. As Nick Blunden pointed out in his insightful piece for Credit Suisse Bulletin last week – ""Because humans are fundamentally social animals, always have been, and probably always will be.""  However, skeptics argue that this unprecedented wave of social media-based entrepreneurs is merely a product of hype. They question the sustainability of this trend and whether it can survive an inevitable downturn. Yet many suggest that these concerns are unfounded as the underlying principles that drive social media are long-term and deeply ingrained in our society.  Financial analysts observe that while euphoria may surround these startups, they remain focused on delivering tangible value to consumers. This is precisely what sets them apart from previous dot-com booms; their business models go beyond mere advertising revenue or vanity metrics like follower counts. Instead, they harness deep customer engagement to generate substantial profits through avenues such as e-commerce sales or licensing agreements.  Moreover, venture capitalists (VCs) who traditionally scrutinize each investment have been quick to recognize the potential in these new-age startups led by influential individuals with already-established platforms. Embracing a broader perspective on entrepreneurship enables VCs to tap into previously untapped markets where traditional methods have failed.  As we move forward into uncharted territory where YouTube sensations and other social media influencers seamlessly transition into tech startup founders, it becomes increasingly evident that their impact is irrefutable. The effectiveness of their marketing campaigns dwarf those conducted by large corporations with substantially greater budgets – largely due to genuine connections nurtured over years between content creators and their audiences.  While critics attempt to dismiss this phenomenon as a passing fad devoid of substance or longevity, evidence points otherwise. As we continue witnessing the elevation of talented individuals who seamlessly blend creativity with entrepreneurship within emerging technologies like AI or blockchain, one thing remains certain: if you're not leveraging social media platforms strategically, you risk fading into obscurity in today's ever-evolving digital landscape.  In essence , entrepreneurs fostered by YouTube represent a fundamental shift in business dynamics – where innovation meets authentic human interaction on an unprecedented scale . Perhaps Nick Blunden said it best – ""If you're not on YouTube, you don't exist."" Whether we embrace or fear this transformation, one thing is undeniable: social media influencers are redefining the boundaries of entrepreneurship and leaving an indelible mark on the global business landscape.",create

With sharp analytical skills coupled with an innate business acumen, it didn't take long for him to rise through the ranks at one of Switzerland's leading financial institutions.

The balance between these two demanding worlds can be as Herculean as one of his throws but Buhari has mastered it effortlessly.  Colleagues at Credit Suisse are often left in awe of Buhari’s ability to seamlessly blend these two seemingly disparate responsibilities. ""It's incredible how Abdul manages to excel in both fields,"" comments John McAllister, a fellow banker and avid sports enthusiast.

During moments away from spreadsheets and client meetings, one can find Buhari at training facilities, putting all his energy into perfecting that lethal technique which has repeatedly placed him on podiums worldwide.

"Title: Serbia's Economic Rebirth: Technology Sector Drives EU Integration Efforts  Introduction  With its tumultuous past slowly fading into obscurity, Serbia is poised to embark on an era of economic prosperity and European integration. The recent extradition of Ratko Mladic, coupled with breakthrough agreements with Kosovo, has enhanced Serbia's prospects of attaining full European Union (EU) candidacy. At the forefront of this transformative journey lies a burgeoning technology sector that promises to propel the country towards greater economic growth and development.  Tech Startups Fueling Economic Growth  Over the past decade, Serbia has witnessed a remarkable surge in tech entrepreneurship. Homegrown startups are leveraging innovation and talent to create game-changing digital solutions with global potential. This thriving ecosystem is attracting not only local investors but also international players seeking opportunities in Southeast Europe.  One such success story is Belgrade-based company Quantox Technology. Founded in 2012 by Marko Filipović, Quantox has rapidly established itself as a leading software development company providing customized solutions for clients worldwide. Its success represents just one example among numerous Serbian tech startups making waves both domestically and internationally.  Government Support Fostering Innovation  Recognizing the immense value that these budding enterprises bring to its economy, the Serbian government has been actively fostering a supportive ecosystem through various initiatives and incentives. Programs like Startup Center Belgrade have been instrumental in nurturing entrepreneurship by offering access to funding, mentorship programs, shared workspaces, and collaboration opportunities.  Additionally, initiatives like ""Digital Serbia"" aim to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) by enhancing connectivity infrastructure across the country while also increasing digital literacy amongst its citizens. These measures have allowed Serbian entrepreneurs to flourish amidst an environment conducive for innovative ideas.  Integration Into Digital Europe  Serbia's rapid technological advancement positions it favorably within EU accession requirements concerning digital infrastructure and regulations—a key aspect often overlooked during economic integration debates.  The potential benefits extend beyond mere compliance; as Serbia aligns its digital framework with EU standards, it opens up vast opportunities for trade and collaboration. The integration of Serbian businesses into the Digital Single Market will enhance cross-border e-commerce, giving them access to over 500 million consumers while stimulating economic growth.  Skills Development and Education Reform  Recognizing that sustainable growth in the tech sector necessitates a highly skilled workforce, Serbia has prioritized education reform to bridge the digital skills gap. Collaborations between universities, industry experts, and international organizations are ensuring curricula remain relevant and adaptable to emerging technological trends.  Furthermore, programs like ""IT Girls"" are encouraging young girls' participation in technology-related fields—breaking gender stereotypes and driving diversity within the sector.  Implications for European Integration  Serbia's burgeoning technology sector serves as a catalyst towards fulfilling its aspirations of joining the EU. Achieving full EU candidacy will provide Serbian startups with unparalleled access to markets traversing borders—a crucial factor that could propel their growth trajectory further.  EU membership not only offers economic benefits but also fosters stronger institutional frameworks facilitating investment security and encouraging competitiveness on par with other member states. Serbian companies embracing EU regulations now stand poised to capitalize on harmonized intellectual property rights, data protection laws, secure cross-border transactions, and streamlined business operations across all borders within the Union.  Conclusion  As Serbia embarks on a new chapter in its history—one marked by progress towards European integration—the impressive strides made by its burgeoning tech sector cannot be ignored. Nurtured by government support schemes and fueled by talented entrepreneurs armed with ingenious ideas, these startups have become pivotal players driving economic growth while positioning Serbia firmly within Europe's digital landscape.  The coming years promise exciting prospects as Serbia continues its journey toward EU candidacy—an achievement underpinned by achievements made possible through innovative technologies fostering prosperity at home while forging stronger ties abroad.",create
"The Illusion of Liquidity: A Psychological Perspective on Market Behavior  By Samantha Rodriguez, Finance Correspondent  In the world of finance, liquidity is often considered a vital characteristic of any tradable asset. Investors crave it, and financial markets thrive on it. However, recent research conducted by leading behavioral finance expert, Dr. Emily Anderson, challenges the commonly held belief that more liquid assets always translate into higher value.  Dr. Anderson's groundbreaking study delves into the psychology behind market behavior and aims to explain why investors are willing to pay a premium for liquidity when it might not necessarily contribute to higher returns.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, Dr. Anderson argues that investors tend to overestimate the importance of liquidity due to what she terms ""the illusion of control."" Her research shows that individuals exhibit a bias towards possessing highly liquid assets because they believe it offers them greater control over their financial destiny.  ""Psychologically speaking,"" explains Dr. Anderson, ""investors feel more secure knowing they can easily enter or exit an investment if necessary.""  To test her hypothesis, Dr. Anderson surveyed a diverse range of investors and observed their behavior in simulated market scenarios with varying degrees of liquidity. The results were enlightening—participants consistently assigned higher valuations to more liquid assets despite their historical underperformance compared to less-liquid alternatives.  ""These findings suggest that investor preferences for liquidity are driven by psychological factors rather than rational economic considerations,"" says John Thomson, Head Economist at Credit Suisse.  This research has profound implications for both individual investors and institutional fund managers who have traditionally favored highly liquid stocks or securities in constructing portfolios aimed at achieving superior returns.  ""While there's no denying that liquidity serves an important role in trading efficiency,"" notes Thomson, ""investors should carefully consider whether they're sacrificing potential gains by focusing solely on highly liquid investments.""  One surprising revelation from Dr. Anderson's study is that there may be hidden opportunities in less-liquid markets.  ""When investors flock towards more liquid assets, they create an environment where prices become inflated due to excessive demand,"" explains Dr. Anderson. ""In contrast, less-liquid assets may be undervalued because of the lower demand.""  This suggests that astute investors willing to tolerate a slightly lower level of liquidity could potentially unlock hidden value in less popular market segments.  While Dr. Anderson's findings challenge established investment practices, not everyone in the financial community is convinced.  Roger Ibbotson, renowned finance professor and founder of Ibbotson Associates, emphasizes that liquidity continues to play a crucial role in investment decision-making.  ""Dr. Anderson's study sheds light on an interesting psychological aspect of market behavior,"" he says. ""However, it's essential to note that less-liquid assets often come with their own unique risks and challenges.""  Indeed, market participants need to carefully balance their desire for liquidity with the potential benefits associated with holding longer-term investments or venturing into emerging markets where liquidity might be relatively scarce.  As investors digest these findings from Dr. Anderson's research, it is clear that traditional notions surrounding liquidity are being reassessed. The illusion of control may no longer justify sacrificing potential returns solely for increased trading flexibility.  Financial professionals and individual investors alike would do well to ponder the implications presented by this groundbreaking study—after all; sometimes swimming against the current can lead to uncharted success in today's volatile markets.

"Ralph van Raat: Bridging the Gap between Contemporary Music and Mainstream Audience  The haunting melodies, unexpected chord progressions, and intricate harmonies of contemporary music may seem intimidating to some. Often misunderstood as an intellectual pursuit reserved for the elite few, the genre has suffered from an unjustified reputation for being too complex to truly appreciate. However, Dutch pianist Ralph van Raat is on a mission to debunk this misconception and show the world that contemporary music is accessible to all.  In an exclusive interview with Credit Suisse Bulletin, van Raat shares his deep passion for contemporary music and his determination to bring it closer to a wider audience. ""The beauty of contemporary music lies in its profound connection with our modern lives,"" he emphasizes. ""Composers today seek to reflect their own experiences of our time within their compositions.""  Van Raat's unwavering belief in the power of this genre stems from his personal encounters with contemporary composers who astonishingly capture the spirit of our era through their works. With every key he presses on his piano, he strives to bridge the gap between composers' intentions and listeners' expectations.  During his illustrious career spanning two decades, van Raat has gained recognition as a champion of contemporary music through daring performances that captivate audiences worldwide. His interpretations shed new light on pieces by renowned composers such as John Adams, Philip Glass, and Thomas Adès.  But Van Raat's dynamism extends beyond captivating live performances; he also actively promotes contemporary compositions through curated albums that showcase innovative musical ideas. This commitment has earned him critical acclaim across numerous platforms including prestigious awards like Edison Classical Music Award and BBC Music Magazine's Newcomer Award.  ""I want to convince people that this music is absolutely worth listening to,"" says van Raat passionately when asked about his motivation behind championing a genre widely seen as avant-garde or inaccessible by mainstream audiences. He believes wholeheartedly that experiencing contemporary music can offer profound emotional and intellectual connections for listeners.  However, van Raat acknowledges the need to demystify the perceived complexities often associated with contemporary compositions. To achieve this, he engages in outreach programs that introduce young minds to the wonders of this genre. By connecting with schools and universities, he encourages students to embrace unfamiliar musical territories, fostering a new generation of open-minded listeners.  In addition to his educational initiatives, Van Raat uses various digital platforms to expand his reach beyond traditional concert halls. Through social media channels and streaming services, he invites audiences from all corners of the globe on a journey through avant-garde symphonies and unconventional harmonies.  ""As technology continues to reshape our world, it also provides us with unprecedented opportunities for discovering new forms of artistic expression,"" says van Raat. ""It is crucial that we leverage these tools to nurture an inclusive appreciation for contemporary music.""  Van Raat's tireless efforts have not gone unnoticed within the industry either. His groundbreaking collaborations with prominent composers such as John Luther Adams and Frederic Rzewski have sparked enthusiasm among fellow musicians who share his vision of bridging classical traditions with modern innovation.  As Ralph van Raat embarks on yet another ambitious project commemorating the centennial celebration of Igor Stravinsky's iconic ""The Rite of Spring,"" it becomes clear that his trailblazing approach will continue disrupting barriers that hinder wider appreciation for contemporary music.  Through his virtuosity on stage and relentless advocacy offstage, Ralph van Raat acts as a guiding light in uniting seemingly disparate worlds: those longing for artistic evolution and those yearning for familiar melodies. By skillfully conveying the emotional depth embedded within contemporary compositions, he empowers everyone – regardless of their musical background – to partake in this timeless art form.  As Ralph van Raat tirelessly works towards strengthening bridges between contemporary music and mainstream audiences worldwide, we eagerly anticipate futures where hearts open wide at the sound of daring chords, and minds are captivated by the rich tapestry of modern symphonies.",create
"Ireland: ""Emerging as an Economic Powerhouse""   While Ireland has faced its fair share of economic challenges in recent years, the country is now showing signs of a remarkable economic turnaround. The nation, once stricken by a financial crisis that led to an EU-IMF bailout in 2010, is now on track to exit the bailout program later this year. Additionally, Ireland is garnering attention from global investors who see great potential in its recovery.  According to Credit Suisse's Head of European Economics Neville Hill, countries like Ireland and Spain may not be as severely impacted by the ongoing financial instability as some may assume. ""The implications for countries like Ireland and Spain, where significant efforts have already been made to bail out their banking systems, may not be as severe,"" Hill stated during a recent investor call.  This statement from Credit Suisse raises an interesting question: What makes Ireland different from other struggling economies? And what does this mean for the future of Irish finance?  In recent years, the Irish government has implemented a series of structural reforms aimed at stabilizing its banking sector and restoring confidence in its economy. These measures have paid off significantly; with impressive economic growth rates exceeding 5% annually over the past few years.  Additionally, Ireland's commitment to attracting international investment has played a crucial role in driving its economic recovery. The nation offers competitive tax incentives and business-friendly policies that have enticed numerous multinational corporations to establish their European headquarters on Irish soil. This influx of foreign direct investment has created job opportunities and stimulated local businesses.  Moreover, while Brexit uncertainty looms over Europe, causing concern for many economies across the continent, it presents unique opportunities for Ireland's financial services industry. With London losing some of its appeal as Europe's foremost financial hub due to Brexit repercussions – including reduced passporting rights – Dublin is emerging as one of the frontrunners vying for London's lost business.  Several major financial institutions have already taken steps to relocate some operations from London to Dublin in preparation for a post-Brexit landscape. Ireland's well-respected regulatory framework and access to EU markets position the country favorably in attracting businesses seeking continuity within the European Union.  Furthermore, Ireland's skilled workforce, renowned educational institutions, and English-speaking population make it an ideal base for companies looking to establish or expand their operations in Europe. Dublin, with its vibrant tech scene and supportive startup ecosystem, has garnered recognition as a global hub for innovation and technological advancement.  The Irish government's ambition doesn't stop there; it has set even higher goals for the country’s future. In line with climate change targets, Ireland aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. This commitment opens up avenues of investment in renewable energy projects that align with global sustainability efforts.  In conclusion, while Ireland faced daunting economic challenges just over a decade ago, today it stands tall as an emerging economic powerhouse. With strategic reforms implemented by the government and strong backing from international investors recognizing its potential growth prospects, Ireland is poised for continued success on the world stage.  As we bid adieu to challenging times marked by financial distress and welcome a new era of stability and resilience in Irish finance, one can't help but applaud this remarkable story of recovery – truly ""the bonds are back in town"" indeed!

"Brexit Negotiations: Diminishing Uncertainty Boosts Investor Confidence  The ongoing Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a crucial stage, with both parties working tirelessly to finalize an agreement that will shape their future relationship. As the talks progress, experts predict profound implications not just for the UK economy itself but also on other countries closely aligned with Europe.  With uncertainty lingering over access to foreign markets and international talent pools, the repercussions of Brexit are expected to weigh heavily on investment in the UK. However, recent developments suggest a more optimistic outlook may be emerging as negotiators make headway in key areas.  As favorable discussions continue, many investors are cautiously reevaluating their earlier concerns. The prospect of greater clarity and certainty has helped diminish some of the apprehension surrounding this historic decision. Consequently, confidence in economic stability is gradually returning.  Initial forecasts had suggested that employment growth might stagnate or even decline following Britain's departure from the EU. However, recent indications point toward a different outcome as investor confidence increases alongside negotiation progress. This renewed optimism has led leading economists to revise projections for job market growth upward.  Furthermore, improved consumer sentiment can be expected as a result of enhanced job prospects and increased economic stability post-Brexit negotiations. As consumers feel more secure about their financial well-being, spending patterns are likely to rise steadily again after being previously hindered by uncertainties surrounding this momentous event.  While there remains a risk of short-term difficulties during this transitional phase in terms of negative growth - potentially resulting in technical recession - experts do not expect these challenges to persist throughout 2017 or beyond. Instead; where initially projected contractions were anticipated for Britain's economy following its exit from Europe; revised estimates now paint a brighter picture - offering hope amidst concerns.  However, it is vital not to overlook global ramifications as Brexit nears conclusion. The intertwined nature of today's economies means that no country exists entirely isolated from this landmark decision. Though the impact will be most strongly felt in Europe, other nations with significant economic ties to the UK are attentively monitoring developments and preparing for potential adjustments.  As negotiations forge ahead toward a comprehensive agreement, global policymakers strive to mitigate the potential risks arising from this process. Close collaboration and sound economic governance will be key tools to navigate these unprecedented challenges successfully.  The resilience of international markets materialized as major economies demonstrated their ability to absorb shocks caused by political uncertainty surrounding Brexit. While pockets of volatility were witnessed immediately following the referendum result, market recovery was swift and steadfast once it became clear that stabilizing measures would be put in place.  Over time, countries further afield but linked via trade routes or investment avenues may also notice ripple effects caused by Brexit. However, financial institutions and multinational corporations have been working diligently to fortify themselves against such contingencies – implementing contingency plans that will safeguard their operations while allowing for necessary adjustments amidst an evolving international landscape.  As final details are painstakingly hammered out in these ongoing discussions between Britain and the EU, industries across the globe eagerly await greater clarity on future arrangements that govern trade agreements and market access rights. The outcome of these talks is poised to shape interactions not only between two politically linked entities but also reverberate throughout our interconnected world economy.  In summary, while Brexit undoubtedly presents formidable challenges for both Britain and Europe alike; progress made during negotiations has brought renewed hope for a positive outcome that balances national interests with mutually beneficial results. As investor confidence rises hand-in-hand with diminishing uncertainties surrounding post-Brexit scenarios; anticipation builds toward an enhanced global economy transcending current tribulations; bracingly navigating its way into a promising tomorrow where measured optimism permeates.",create
"Swiss Retail Sector Embraces Digital Transformation, Defying Economic Uncertainty  Zurich, Switzerland - In a surprising turn of events, the Swiss retail sector has not only managed to weather the economic storm but is also embracing digital transformation to drive growth. Despite facing significant challenges in 2016, including falling demand and declining sales figures for the second consecutive year, retailers have shown remarkable resilience by adapting to changing consumer preferences.  According to the latest report from Credit Suisse Research Institute, the Swiss retail industry saw nominal sector sales decline by 1.0 percent in 2016 compared to the previous year. This decline can be partially attributed to lower prices as well as an ongoing impact from abandoning the EUR/CHF exchange rate floor.  However, amid this challenging landscape, some retailers have successfully adapted their strategies and are leading the way in embracing digital advancements. Online sales have witnessed exponential growth over recent years and continue their upward trajectory. While food retailers posted slight gains in nominal sales figures last year, it was their non-food counterparts that were hit hardest by changing consumer behavior.  Leading technology analyst John Doe predicts that online shopping will account for over half of all retail e-commerce transactions within three years: ""Swiss consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with making purchases online due to convenience and competitive pricing offered by e-retailers,"" he states.  One such example of a pioneering retailer that has embraced digital transformation is Finest Watches GmbH. The Zurich-based luxury watch retailer recently launched an innovative virtual reality (VR) experience that allows customers to explore its exclusive collection from anywhere in the world. By donning VR headsets or using compatible devices at home or within physical stores equipped with VR stations, customers can visualize how different watch models would look on their wrist before finalizing a purchase.  ""We wanted our customers to enjoy an immersive shopping experience without compromising on quality and personalization,"" says Sarah Müller-Kleinman, CEO of Finest Watches GmbH. ""By utilizing VR technology, we are not just adapting to changing consumer preferences but also creating new opportunities to engage with our customers on a deeper level.""  Similarly, fashion giant SwissFashion AG has embraced augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the online shopping experience for its customers. By using a smartphone or tablet, shoppers can virtually try on outfits in the comfort of their own homes. This innovative approach has not only boosted sales but has also reduced return rates significantly.  The digital transformation wave is also being witnessed across brick-and-mortar stores. According to Credit Suisse's report, smart checkouts that eliminate the need for queues and cashiers have become increasingly popular in larger cities like Zurich and Geneva. In-store technologies such as interactive touchscreens and virtual mirrors have also contributed to enhancing customer experience and driving sales growth.  While some retailers took longer than others to embrace these changes, they now see the benefits of leveraging technology in both physical stores and online platforms. The shift towards digitalization allows them to cater their offerings more precisely based on customer preferences while unlocking new revenue streams through personalized selling techniques.  Urs Böhlen, Head of Retail Banking at Credit Suisse Switzerland, highlights the long-term impact this transformation will have: ""Swiss retailers who successfully digitize their operations will be better equipped for sustained growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty,"" he explains. ""Those who resist this change risk being left behind in an increasingly competitive landscape.""  As Swiss retailers continue their journey towards a digitally driven future, consumers can look forward to an enhanced shopping experience both online and offline. With technology acting as an enabler rather than disruptor within the retail landscape, it is evident that embracing digital transformation holds significant potential for retailers seeking sustainable success in an ever-evolving market.  About Credit Suisse Bulletin: Credit Suisse Bulletin is one of Switzerland's premier banking magazines providing insightful analysis covering economics, culture, sports and entertainment across industries worldwide since 1905.

"Title: Thriving Tourism Industry Boosts Philippines' Economic Growth  The allure of the Philippines as Asia's next big thing is not limited to its impressive economic performance alone. While the country has made significant strides in attracting foreign investment and improving key economic indicators, one sector that has been a game-changer for the nation is its burgeoning tourism industry. Renowned for its stunning landscapes, cultural diversity, and world-class hospitality, the archipelago is fast becoming a must-visit destination for globetrotters seeking unique experiences.  Over the past decade, a meticulously planned strategy by local authorities and private stakeholders has driven positive growth in tourism. The government's strong commitment to infrastructure development, coupled with ecotourism initiatives aimed at preserving natural attractions while promoting sustainable tourism practices, have paid off handsomely.  In 2019 alone, tourist arrivals surpassed all previous records with over 8 million visitors flocking to the country's tropical paradises. This surge represents a staggering 15% increase compared to the previous year and showcases an upward trajectory that shows no signs of slowing down. Experts predict that if this trend continues at its current pace, tourist arrivals could reach an unprecedented milestone of 12 million by 2022.  One key factor contributing to this remarkable boom in Philippine tourism is its irresistible blend of sun-soaked beaches combined with rich cultural heritage. The country offers visitors an eclectic range of experiences - from exploring ancient rice terraces etched into mountainsides in Banaue to tranquil island hopping adventures across Palawan's crystal-clear waters, home to one of the New7Wonders of Nature – Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.  Furthermore, major cities like Manila are transforming rapidly into modern metropolises without losing their historical charm. Intramuros – Manila's walled city – stands as a testament to centuries-old architecture juxtaposed against sleek skyscrapers within easy reach from miles-long shopping complexes, creating an enchanting juxtaposition of old and new.  The economic allure of tourism extends beyond the influx of visitors alone. The industry fosters job creation, entrepreneurial opportunities, and shared prosperity throughout the country. Credit Suisse's Research Institute expects that by 2027, tourism will account for approximately 13% of Philippine GDP growth - a clear indication of its integral role in the nation's economic expansion.  Foreign investors are taking notice too; international hotel chains such as Marriott, Hilton, and AccorHotels have significantly expanded their presence in key tourism hotspots. These initiatives not only boost the economy but also enhance existing infrastructure while providing world-class accommodation options to cater to evolving traveler preferences.  To sustain this incredible momentum, both public and private sectors are working hand in hand to further improve tourist facilities, streamline visa processes, enhance airport connectivity with more direct flights from major global hubs like London and New York to cities like Cebu or Davao.  It is essential for stakeholders to continually strike a balance between enticing travelers from abroad while preserving the natural wonders that make this tropical paradise so irresistible. Conservation efforts remain pivotal to preserve ecological integrity as seen through collaborations between local authorities and environmental organizations.  Additionally, investments in human capital development ensure that hospitality professionals continuously refine their skills in providing exceptional service experiences – effectively positioning themselves at par with renowned tourist destinations worldwide.  As global travelers become increasingly aware of this hidden gem situated within Southeast Asia's embrace — they are destined never just forget about these captivating islands once they set foot ashore. With its picturesque landscapes deserving Hollywood blockbusters mentions should certainly perceive it as no surprise if Philippine beaches soon grace lavish magazine spreads worldwide – cementing its spot amongst Asia's most sought-after travel destinations well into future decades.

"Title: The Catwalk Goes Virtual: Fashion Industry Embraces Augmented Reality  Introduction:  The fashion industry has always been at the forefront of embracing technological advancements. From the invention of man-made materials to zipper and Velcro fasteners, innovation is ingrained in its DNA. In keeping with this tradition, the digital revolution is once again causing seismic shifts in the world of fashion. This time, it's augmented reality (AR) that is tantalizing designers, brands, and consumers alike.  Fashion Gets a Digital Makeover:  Augmented reality, which overlays virtual elements onto real-world environments, promises to transform the way we shop for clothes. Customers can now virtually try on garments from anywhere using nothing more than their smartphone or tablet.  Leading e-commerce platforms are incorporating AR technology into their apps to offer a more immersive shopping experience. By superimposing items onto a live camera feed or uploaded images of themselves, shoppers can see how an outfit looks without physically trying it on. Users can visualize different styles and colors against their own body shape and size – greatly reducing buyer's remorse and increasing satisfaction levels.  High-End Designers Enter the AR Arena:  Augmented reality is no longer confined to digital storefronts; luxury fashion labels are also entering this exciting new realm. Chanel recently launched an AR-powered sneaker try-on feature as part of its mobile app, allowing customers to virtually ""wear"" limited edition shoes before making a purchase.  Similarly, Burberry incorporates AR technology in its flagship stores where customers gain access to interactive mirrors that let them digitally try on outfits from previous collections or experiment with mix-and-match combinations tailored exclusively for them.  Sustainability Meets Technology:  As concerns about sustainability grow ever louder within the fashion industry, augmented reality presents additional avenues for eco-friendly practices. With virtual closets becoming more prevalent thanks to AR features in shopping apps, consumers might be enticed into purchasing fewer physical garments while still being able to enjoy a vast variety of choices.  Moreover, by visualizing outfits in augmented reality, customers can experiment and create new looks without actually owning multiple pieces. Fashion rental services can leverage this trend by offering subscriptions to virtual wardrobes, allowing individuals to perpetually refresh their style without increasing waste or carbon footprints.  Authenticity in the Digital Realm:  While augmented reality undoubtedly offers numerous benefits, it also poses challenges for the fashion industry. Ensuring that digital representations closely match real-life garments requires meticulous attention to detail and sophisticated technologies like 3D modeling.  Designers will face the task of maintaining brand integrity within the digital realm while guaranteeing customer satisfaction. Striking this balance between authenticity and convenience will be crucial as AR becomes a pervasive part of the overall fashion experience.  Conclusion:  The fusion of fashion with augmented reality is providing groundbreaking opportunities for both consumers and industry players alike. Gone are the days when trying on clothes was limited to physical location or relying solely on one's imagination. As tech-savvy consumers embrace these advancements, fashion brands must adapt and capitalize on augmented reality as an indispensable tool for engaging customers in an increasingly digitized world. The marriage between technology and fashion has never been more compelling – bringing innovation directly into our closets with just a few taps on our screens.  Continuing its age-old tradition of embracing innovation, the global fashion industry is now stepping onto an entirely different runway – where virtual garments find expression through AR technology that empowers shoppers worldwide.

"The Evolution of Fashion Companies: Sustainability Takes the Center Stage  Fashion companies have always been a dynamic and ever-changing industry, with brands rising and falling in popularity like the ebb and flow of the tides. The allure of fashion lies in its ability to capture our desires and express our individuality. While many fashion companies strive to stay relevant by creating trendy branded products, a new wave has emerged - one that places sustainability at the forefront.  In recent years, we have witnessed an intriguing shift in the fashion landscape. A number of innovative clothing brands have eschewed traditional marketing strategies by forgoing branded products altogether. Instead, they focus on revolutionizing their supply chain efficiency to meet the demands of conscious consumers around the globe.  Enterprising companies like Zara, owned by Inditex, and H&M are leading this quiet revolution as they redefine what it means to be a successful fashion house. Unlike their counterparts that rely heavily on branding merchandise, Zara and H&M offer unbranded clothes that embody style rather than simply displaying logos.  Zara's rise to prominence within the industry cannot be overstated. With its fast supply chain model at its core, Zara has transformed how modern fashion businesses operate. By reducing lead times from design concept to production to a matter of weeks instead of months or even years, they effectively de-risked their business model and minimized inventory waste.  This transformation did not happen overnight; it was born out of necessity; however, it is now celebrated for both its efficiency and environmental impact. In an era where sustainability concerns are gaining prominence among consumers worldwide - especially millennials who prioritize conscious shopping practices - Zara's approach resonates deeply with those seeking alternatives in an increasingly disposable culture.  H&M shares similar values when it comes to sustainable fashion practices but follows a slightly different path towards achieving them. As one of Sweden's most renowned exports, H&M embraces economic viability through recycled materials while simultaneously promoting ethical production processes.

In response to mounting demand for eco-friendly fashion, H&M established a garment collection program that encourages consumers to return old clothes in exchange for discounts on new purchases. This innovative approach not only reduces waste but also boosts customer loyalty by fostering an ongoing commitment between the brand and its environmentally-conscious patrons.  The success of Zara and H&M demonstrate that fashionable clothing need not rely solely on branding but can thrive through improved supply chain models and sustainable practices. As the world becomes more aware of the environmental impact of fast fashion, customers are favoring brands that prioritize ethical manufacturing processes, reduced waste generation, and circular economy initiatives.  Furthermore, this shift in consumer behavior has created opportunities for smaller players within the industry who specialize in sustainable luxury apparel. Previously occupied by well-established high-end brands known primarily for their logos, this niche market is expanding rapidly as sustainability becomes an increasingly important consideration for consumers across all income brackets.  The rise of sustainable fashion houses challenges conventional thinking about brand recognition while highlighting the importance of responsible production methods. As these companies prioritize transparency and ethical sourcing, they are forging new paths towards a greener future without compromising style or individual expression.  In conclusion, fashion is evolving beyond ephemeral trends and superficial branding. The emergence of successful unbranded clothing companies like Zara and H&M demonstrates that efficiency in supply chains combined with sustainability can be potent tools driving brand growth. By embracing these concepts as pillars of their business models, these trailblazers usher in a new era where fashion merges seamlessly with conscious consumerism – truly setting themselves apart from their traditional counterparts within the industry.

"Australia's Economic Future: From the Mine to the Mind  A decade-long commodities boom made Australia one of the few developed countries to escape a recession in 2008, but its resources-dependent economy has slowed as China, Australia's most ardent customer, has seen its own economy cool. As China heads for what seems like a long-term economic rebalancing, Australia's budding tech startup community could play an increasingly prominent role in the national economy, not only because of the continent's strong entrepreneurial streak but also out of necessity.  In May 2013, the Australian government said that capital investment in the mining sector had peaked and was expected to decline sharply over subsequent years. This raised concerns about potential job losses and economic instability. However, it also sparked a shift in focus towards innovation-driven industries such as technology and robotics.  Fast forward several years later and this pivot is starting to pay off. According to recent data from Startup Muster, which tracks trends within Australia's startup ecosystem, there are now more than 2,500 active tech startups across various sectors including fintech (financial technology), medtech (medical technology), edtech (education technology), and agritech (agricultural technology). These startups are transforming traditional industries and creating new opportunities for growth.  One shining example of this is Atlassian - an Australian software company that specializes in collaboration tools for businesses. Founded by two university graduates in 2002 with just $10k investment from credit cards, it has since become one of Australia's most successful tech companies with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Atlassian’s success story showcases Australia’s untapped potential in the global tech industry.  The flourishing startup scene is attracting entrepreneurs from around the world who see Australia as an attractive destination for their ventures. Accessible government initiatives such as entrepreneur visas and funding programs like the National Innovation & Science Agenda have encouraged international talent to bring their expertise Down Under.  However, it's not just about attracting foreign talent; Australian universities are also playing a vital role in nurturing domestic entrepreneurship. Universities across the country have launched incubators and accelerators to support and mentor startups, providing access to resources, networks, and even funding. This collaboration between academia and industry is fostering technology-driven innovation that has great economic potential.  The benefits of this shift towards the tech sector are already evident. A report by Deloitte Access Economics found that high-growth firms - primarily tech startups - accounted for 1.5 million new jobs over a decade until 2016, compared with only 400,000 from traditional industries such as mining.  Furthermore, recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals that the digital economy contributed more than $122 billion to Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019-2020 – approximately equivalent to 6% of its total GDP. This further strengthens the case for embracing technology-led industries as key economic drivers.  However, challenges remain on Australia's path towards becoming a global tech powerhouse. Accessible venture capital funding is crucial for these startups' growth beyond their initial stages. While investment capital has been steadily increasing in recent years, there is still room for improvement.  Additionally, addressing skill shortages in high-demand areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity will be essential for sustaining long-term growth within Australia's tech sector. The government must invest in education and training programs to develop a pipeline of talent capable of driving technological advancement.  As China continues its economic transition and Australia seeks resilience beyond resources exports alone - utilizing intellectual capabilities rather than natural resources - it becomes clear that the future lies not just in mines but also in minds Down Under. Embracing technology-driven innovations presents an opportunity for Australia to diversify its economy while tapping into its entrepreneurial spirit.  The transition may not be seamless or without hurdles; however, with strategic investments in infrastructure development, regulatory frameworks supporting innovation, and collaboration between sectors, Australia has the potential to be at the forefront of the global tech revolution. By nurturing its startups and fostering an innovation ecosystem, Australia can position itself as a hub for technological advancement and secure a prosperous economic future in this rapidly changing world.",create
"Impact of Brexit on the Cambridge Innovation Ecosystem  The consequences of the UK's decision to leave the European Union continue to be felt across various sectors, with uncertainty plaguing markets and economies alike. While much attention has been given to the financial services industry in London, another crucial sector impacted by Brexit is innovation and technology. Specifically, the renowned Cambridge innovation ecosystem is now confronting new challenges brought about by this historic event.  Cambridge, a city located in eastern England, is synonymous with scientific breakthroughs and cutting-edge technology. Its dynamic entrepreneurial environment has long attracted talent from around the world, making it a hub for startups and research institutions.

But with Brexit looming over us like a cloud of uncertainty, we risk losing valuable team members who bring unique perspectives.""  Furthermore, startups that rely heavily on accessing both British and EU markets are grappling with navigating potential trade restrictions that may arise post-Brexit. Many entrepreneurs have cited concerns over bureaucratic hurdles impeding their ability to do business effortlessly across borders—a vital factor for scaling up operations rapidly.  Raj Patel is one such entrepreneur whose food tech startup aims at revolutionizing sustainable farming practices through AI-driven solutions. His venture recently secured funding from multiple European investors who identified synergies between Patel's vision and their respective countries' agricultural needs.  However, with Brexit causing ambiguity over the future relationship between the UK and the EU, Patel is anxious about maintaining these crucial relationships: ""Working hand-in-hand with European investors gives us access to expertise and networks that would be challenging to replicate elsewhere. Without that support, our ability to make significant strides in tackling global challenges will be severely hindered.""  The potential loss of critical funding sources is also a pressing concern within Cambridge's innovation ecosystem. Historically, various EU programs have proved instrumental in nurturing ambitious startups through grants or favorable loan schemes. With British involvement in these initiatives now uncertain, securing alternative funding avenues becomes paramount.  Recognizing the significance of this issue, local authorities are exploring diversification strategies for driving investment into the region. Initiatives such as public-private partnerships and collaborations with tech giants are being considered to ensure financial backing continues flowing into promising ventures.  Moreover, a brighter note amid the uncertainty is that collaboration throughout Europe's research community remains strong outside institutional frameworks. Academics remain committed to sharing knowledge beyond political boundaries.  Professor Sanders highlights this resilience: ""Science knows no borders; ideas transcend politics. While Brexit poses challenges on several fronts for Cambridge's innovation ecosystem, I am confident we will find new ways of working together and continue pushing boundaries within our respective fields.""  In conclusion, it is clear that Brexit has cast a hazy outlook on Cambridge's renowned innovation ecosystem. Yet amidst adversity lies opportunity—the chance to build new relationships beyond geographic limitations and foster even greater creativity by bringing diverse minds together.  Brexit may pose hurdles for Cambridge's entrepreneurs and researchers alike; however, if history has shown us anything about this illustrious city—it thrives on overcoming challenges, unlocking breakthroughs when faced with uncertainty – its spirit undeterred by any economic headwind it may encounter along its path towards progress.",create

Against this backdrop, Portugal has managed to rise above its economic challenges by capitalizing on its rich gastronomic traditions. As Budget Minister João Leão noted recently, ""Food is part of our identity; it is in our DNA.""  While measures imposed as part of EU-IMF aid packages have divided public opinion due to their impact on everyday life, Portuguese cuisine remains a unifying force that transcends economic concerns. In recent months, large demonstrations against austerity measures have rocked the country. However, beneath the surface lies a collective appreciation for Portugal's rich culinary heritage that cuts across political affiliations.  With sleepy fishing villages hugging picturesque coastlines and rolling vineyards drenched in abundant sunshine inland – all producing some of Europe's finest produce – Portugal serves up an array of delectable delights that are hard to resist. From succulent seafood dishes inspired by Atlantic traditions to hearty stews infused with Mediterranean flavors from Alentejo region; every bite seems like a culinary love letter dedicated to preserving tradition while embracing innovation.  Overcoming historical challenges such as monopolistic competition from larger neighbors Spain and France wasn't easy – but it forged resilience within Portuguese chefs who were forced to explore new frontiers in order to survive. Today their efforts bear fruit (literally) with prestigious accolades like Michelin stars gracing dining establishments across the country.  The local wine industry also plays a pivotal role in Portugal's economic resurgence. The country's unique microclimates and indigenous grape varieties have produced an exciting range of wines that have caught the attention of oenophiles worldwide. In particular, regions such as Douro and Alentejo have achieved international recognition for their bold reds, nuanced whites, and fortified Ports.  These accomplishments not only bring solace to a nation yearning for positive news but also fuel Portugal's tourism industry – another vital source of revenue. The allure of indulging in seafood feasts paired with exquisite local wines amplifies the charm of sun-drenched beaches and captivating historic sites that dot this Iberian gem.  Recognizing the significance of this growth sector, European institutions are exploring opportunities to support Portugal's food and wine industry further. Credit Suisse analysts suggest offering incentives to boost exports and encourage greater collaboration among producers could be mutually beneficial for all parties involved – including neighboring countries grappling with their own financial challenges.  Portugal may indeed stand at a crossroads; however, its culinary prowess has emerged as a beacon of optimism amid economic uncertainty. By capitalizing on its rich food heritage, Portugal demonstrates how diversification can nurture resilience within economies facing adversity. With every bite savored or sip enjoyed by locals and visitors alike, the country takes another step towards prosperity - one plate at a time.  In conclusion, while many challenges lie ahead for Portugal on its path to economic recovery, one thing remains certain: the nation's impeccable cuisine will continue to unite people from all walks of life during these uncertain times",create
"Central Banks Embrace New Approach to Combat Economic Downturns  In the wake of the global financial crisis, central banks around the world have been forced to adopt unconventional measures to prevent further economic turmoil. While these actions have been successful in averting a deeper recession, they have also raised concerns about the long-term consequences and effectiveness of such strategies.  Traditionally, central banks primarily relied on interest rate adjustments as their main tool for managing economic cycles. However, faced with unprecedented challenges and limited scope for traditional monetary policy measures, they have had to explore alternative ways to stimulate growth and stabilize financial markets.  The Swiss National Bank (SNB), like many other central banks, has embarked on an innovative journey by expanding its balance sheet. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the SNB's balance sheet has grown almost fivefold. Initially driven by efforts to support UBS during the crisis, it has now become a cornerstone of their approach towards maintaining stability in Switzerland's economy.  This shift in strategy reflects a broader trend among central banks worldwide. Instead of relying solely on interest rate adjustments or traditional monetary policy tools, they are now embracing a range of unconventional methods aimed at achieving specific objectives.  One noteworthy example is forward guidance - a technique that involves clearly communicating future monetary policy intentions to market participants and investors. By providing forward-looking information about interest rates or asset purchase programs, central banks can influence market expectations and guide economic behavior accordingly.  Another unconventional measure gaining popularity is quantitative easing (QE). This involves large-scale purchases of government bonds or other assets by central banks with newly created money. The primary objective is twofold: increasing liquidity in financial markets and stimulating lending activity to bolster economic growth.  Furthermore, some central banks have even ventured into negative interest rate territory - charging commercial banks for holding excess reserves instead of offering them positive returns. While this move may seem counterintuitive at first glance, it aims to encourage banks to lend money rather than hoard it, thereby stimulating economic activity.  These innovative approaches have undoubtedly helped central banks navigate through challenging economic times. However, they also raise questions about potential risks and unintended consequences. Critics argue that the prolonged use of such measures could give rise to asset price bubbles or inflationary pressures down the line.  Therefore, as central banks continue to fine-tune their strategies, it is imperative for them to strike a delicate balance between avoiding financial instability and ensuring sustainable economic growth. Periodic assessments of the effectiveness and impact of these unconventional measures are crucial in guiding future policy decisions.  Moreover, given the evolving landscape of global economies and financial markets, central banks must remain vigilant and adaptable in addressing emerging challenges. Technological advancements like cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance are disrupting traditional monetary systems, necessitating proactive responses from central banks in order to maintain stability.  In conclusion, the aftermath of the financial crisis has forced central banks worldwide - including the SNB - to rethink their approach to monetary policy. By embracing unconventional measures such as forward guidance and quantitative easing, they have displayed remarkable innovation in navigating uncharted waters. As these strategies evolve further with changing economic dynamics, effective communication with stakeholders becomes pivotal in gaining confidence while keeping potential risks at bay.",create
"Mastering the Fine Art of ""Fin-Tech"": The Latest Alliance Between Financial Firms and Social Media Platforms  By Amy Bradley  In today's interconnected world, where the virtual realm knows no boundaries, financial firms have realized the potential that lies within social media platforms. The burgeoning influence of social media is rapidly permeating every facet of our lives, a phenomenon eerily reminiscent of the far-reaching tentacles synonymous with our financial services sector. As these two behemoths converge, new possibilities and opportunities arise.  While their union has created an array of synergistic effects in various domains, it is in the realm of data analytics where this marriage truly thrives. Firms are now leveraging cutting-edge algorithms to connect financial experts with social networking virtuosos. Together, they embark on a journey to unravel the intricacies embedded within oceans of user-generated data produced by hundreds of millions across global platforms such as ""Ekonnect.""  Imagine a world where market trends and consumer sentiment can be analyzed at lightning speed by intrepid analysts who harness raw intelligence from one's idle tweets or status updates; this is precisely what these newly minted alliances bring forth.  This audacious step into uncharted territory has captured both investor fascination and regulatory scrutiny alike. Critics question whether traditional finance should dabble so brazenly in this online sphere purportedly reserved for memes and viral videos. Yet it is undeniable that social media stands as a ripe source bursting with real-time information that could shape investment landscapes.  Thanks to partnerships between financial institutions like Credit Suisse and tech giants such as Ekonnect – an emerging force tipped to outpace its competitors – big data no longer holds any secrets.  As we delve deeper into this symbiotic relationship between finance and technology, new doors swing open for smaller investors who often rely on time-consuming research or costly professional advice before making critical investment decisions. With innovative tools available at their fingertips, retail investors can now navigate market trends quickly and efficiently, allowing for well-informed investment strategies previously reserved for the elite.  Take, for example, Lily Chen, a retail investor from Taiwan who aspires to grow her budding portfolio. Traditionally limited to scouring financial news outlets and analysts' reports, Lily felt she could not fully grasp the complexities of market dynamics. But now, armed with Ekonnect's comprehensive analytics suite and guided by industry experts through forums within the platform itself, she confidently navigates an intricate web of financial data. The insights she gains empower her to stay one step ahead of markets at all times.  However, this brave new world is not without its pitfalls. Risk management enthusiasts raise concerns about potential information overload or false market cues that may arise from this influx of social media-derived intelligence. Critics argue that blindly relying on unfettered access to colossal pools of data can skew perceptions or lead investors astray.  To address these concerns head-on while fostering responsible usage within this digitized ecosystem, regulatory bodies have begun actively encouraging financial firms to adopt stringent risk management protocols. This collaborative approach aims to strike a balance between harnessing the power of social media analytics and mitigating adverse consequences borne out of imprudent decision-making.  Moreover, amidst rising calls for increased transparency in finance-related matters following numerous high-profile scandals involving large institutions in recent years – an area where Credit Suisse has been particularly pro-active – integrating crowdsourced opinions salvaged from platforms like ""Ekonnect"" can help restore public trust by including diverse perspectives beyond those traditionally found within established financial circles alone.  The union between finance and social media does not merely reshape the investment landscape but also inspires new paradigms in entrepreneurial endeavors. Start-ups employing social media platforms as launchpads have enjoyed unprecedented success rates due to enhanced accessibility and exposure created by these alliances.  In conclusion, as traditionally isolated industries converge in a rapidly evolving world driven by technological innovation; finance and social media embrace an era of unprecedented collaboration. The ability to navigate uncharted territories while strategically harnessing the tide of big data ushers in a new financial landscape, democratizing access like never before. While challenges undoubtedly persist, for those who subtly blend finance with fin-tech, the sky is not the limit – it's just another opportunity awaiting exploration.

"Title: How Blockchain Technology is Transforming Global Trade  Introduction: In recent years, another revolution has been silently brewing in the world of global trade, driven by the advent of blockchain technology. Just as the introduction of shipping containers transformed the transportation of goods in the mid-20th century, blockchain now promises to streamline and secure international trade like never before. Today, we delve into this exciting new development and its potential impact on businesses and economies worldwide.  The Blockchain Revolution: Blockchain, often described as a distributed ledger technology (DLT), is at its core a digital record-keeping system that allows transactions to be securely recorded and verified across multiple computers or nodes, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This revolutionary technology gained mainstream attention as it underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but its applications extend far beyond just virtual currencies.  Securing Supply Chains: One area where blockchain has already shown immense promise is supply chain management. By utilizing smart contracts on a blockchain network, companies can trace their products from raw material sourcing all the way through each stage of production until final delivery. This provides unparalleled transparency throughout complex global supply chains, reducing fraud and counterfeit risks while enhancing efficiency.  Trade Finance Innovation: Trade finance is another sector set for transformation with blockchain. The traditional paper-based process involves extensive documentation verification and manual reconciliations which are costly and time-consuming. Blockchain's immutable ledger eliminates redundancy by providing real-time digital authentication along each step of a transaction's journey – significantly reducing costs while accelerating processing times.  Empowering Small Businesses: Historically marginalized due to their limited access to credit facilities or high collateral requirements when participating in international trade networks, small businesses now have an opportunity for greater inclusivity through blockchain-powered platforms. These platforms allow small-scale producers from emerging economies to connect directly with buyers while ensuring transparency regarding product origin and quality.  Reducing Trade Disputes: Disagreements between trading partners have been stumbling blocks since merchants first sailed across oceans. However, blockchain's ability to create a transparent and tamper-proof record of transaction history can reduce the risk of disputes by providing a shared source of truth that all parties can trust. This not only saves time and resources but also fosters stronger long-term relationships between trading partners.  Revolutionizing Customs Operations: Blockchain technology is also set to revolutionize customs operations in ports around the world. By providing real-time visibility into cargo movement, customs authorities can streamline processes, reducing paperwork, human error, and the potential for smuggling or counterfeits entering countries undetected. Enhanced security measures coupled with increased efficiency will lead to smoother border crossings.  Addressing Sustainability Concerns: By leveraging blockchain's ability to track and authenticate each stage of a product's lifecycle from sourcing through disposal, businesses can ensure compliance with environmental regulations more effectively. Blockchain's transparency makes it easier to identify sustainable practices or unethical behaviors across supply chains – promoting responsible production methods while meeting evolving consumer demand for eco-friendly products.  Conclusion: The transformational potential of blockchain technology in global trade cannot be understated. From creating more efficient supply chains to facilitating greater financial inclusion and promoting sustainability initiatives, its impact will reverberate throughout economies worldwide. As businesses seize this opportunity for innovation, we expect trade networks built on blockchain platforms to become increasingly pervasive – further strengthening international trade relationships while propelling economic growth into the future.

"A Good Night's Sleep: Unlocking the Secret to Improved Decision-Making  by Emily Collins, Credit Suisse Bulletin  We have all experienced that foggy-headed feeling after a night of restless sleep. It's no secret that a lack of quality shuteye can leave us feeling groggy and irritable. But what if the impact on our decision-making abilities runs deeper than we realize? New research suggests that a good night's sleep might be the secret to unlocking our true potential for problem-solving and creativity.  Renowned sleep scientist, Dr. Laura Davis, believes that we have only scratched the surface when it comes to understanding the powerful role sleep plays in our cognitive functions. ""For years, people underestimated the importance of sleep on brain function,"" says Dr. Davis. ""But recent scientific advancements are revealing just how essential it is for clear thinking and making sound decisions.""  Studies conducted at Stanford University's Center for Sleep Research have shown compelling evidence linking quality sleep with enhanced problem-solving skills. Contrary to popular belief, while our bodies rest during slumber, our brains are hard at work behind the scenes.  During different stages of deep REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, our brains consolidate memories from throughout the day into more permanent storage within neural networks. This process not only helps us retain information but also contributes to insight generation by connecting disparate pieces of information.  Furthermore, studies with participants deprived of sufficient REM sleep consistently demonstrated decreased ability in complex decision-making tasks compared to those who enjoyed uninterrupted restful nights. Researchers believe this is due to compromised communication between different brain regions responsible for critical thinking and creative problem-solving.  Even brief naps have been found beneficial in aiding logical reasoning and innovative thinking processes. Remarkably, according to findings published recently in The Journal of Neuroscience, as little as 10 minutes may confer significant cognitive advantages over individuals who forego midday shut-eye completely.  However understandable these findings may seem scientifically, society's perception of sleep remains outdated. Many still consider sleep as merely a period of inactivity and idleness. Consequently, individuals often prioritize their busy schedules over getting enough quality sleep, leading to the detriment of their own decision-making capacities.  Jason Clarke, a high-profile executive at an investment firm, testified to this firsthand. ""I used to wear my chronic lack of sleep as a badge of honor,"" he confesses. ""But after experiencing burnout and making costly mistakes in important negotiations due to a lack of focus and clarity, I completely shifted my approach.""  Clarke now focuses on optimizing his sleep routine, following his doctor's advice on setting consistent bedtimes and creating an environment conducive to restful sleep. ""The results were astounding,"" he says with enthusiasm. ""I could think more clearly and creatively tackle complex problems that used to leave me stumped.""  The implications for businesses are significant as well. Companies may need to reassess their work culture and support employees in adopting healthier sleeping habits for better decision-making outcomes.  In light of these findings, Credit Suisse is taking proactive steps towards promoting better employee well-being by implementing company-wide initiatives aimed at improving the quality and quantity of employee sleep.  ""While we have long acknowledged the importance of work-life balance,"" states CEO John Thompson-Jones, ""we have come to realize that helping our employees prioritize quality sleep is just as crucial for fostering productivity as any other workplace wellness program.""  As scientific advancements continue unlocking the secrets behind how our brains function during slumber, it becomes increasingly clear that sleeping may be the ultimate performance enhancer - a natural elixir supporting sound judgment-making abilities.  Perhaps it's time we reevaluate our approach toward achieving success – one night’s restful slumber at a time.  ---  Words: 613",create
"Switzerland Emerges as Global Leader in Sustainable Finance   Switzerland, known for its pristine landscapes and commitment to environmental preservation, has once again made headlines for its forward-thinking approach. This time, it's the country's financial sector that is leading the charge towards sustainability. As global concern over climate change intensifies, Switzerland has placed itself at the forefront of sustainable finance, attracting investors who prioritize environmentally-friendly practices.  With its strong tradition of banking excellence and a strategic vision for the future, Switzerland is capturing the attention of both domestic and international investors seeking to align their financial portfolios with their environmental values.  Credit Suisse economist Hans Müller believes that this trend can be partly attributed to the successful implementation of stringent regulations by Swiss banking institutions. ""Swiss banks have recognized that incorporating sustainability into their operations is not just an ethical imperative but also a sound business strategy,"" says Müller.  One of the key initiatives driving this shift is Switzerland's commitment to becoming a carbon-neutral country by 2050. The government has introduced robust policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of society. This commitment extends to the financial sector as well, with Swiss banks actively promoting investments in renewable energy projects and sustainable businesses.  ""The shift towards sustainable finance in Switzerland can be seen as a response to both regulatory changes and increasing consumer demand,"" explains Sophie Dubois, Head of Sustainable Investments at Credit Suisse. ""Investors are becoming more conscious about investing in companies that prioritize environmental responsibility.""  Dubois emphasizes that sustainability-focused investments are not just limited to niche sectors anymore. ""We are witnessing a fundamental change in investor behavior where sustainable investments have become mainstream,"" she adds.  This embrace of sustainable finance has translated into tangible results for Swiss banks. In recent years, they have recorded significant growth in assets under management dedicated explicitly to sustainable investment strategies.  The success stories within this space are abundant – from infrastructure projects supporting renewable energy generation on Swiss soil to innovative start-ups making breakthroughs in carbon capture technologies. Swiss banks have played a critical role in financing and propelling these initiatives to new heights.  As the demand for sustainable finance increases globally, Switzerland has seized this opportunity to position itself as the go-to hub for socially-responsible investments. The country's reputation for stability and financial expertise, combined with its commitment to sustainability, has led investors from around the world to consider Swiss banks as their trusted partners.  However, it is not just Swiss institutions that are benefiting from this trend; international financial players are also looking to gain a foothold in Switzerland's booming sustainable finance market. This influx of competition is driving innovation further and creating an environment where investors can access an array of sustainable investment options.  While skepticism remains about whether the financial sector can truly foster positive change on such a global scale, there is no denying that Switzerland's dedication to sustainable finance provides hope for a greener future. By aligning economic growth with responsible practices, Switzerland proves that it is possible for nations aspiring towards sustainability to do so without compromising prosperity.  With Switzerland pioneering efforts in sustainable finance, other countries will be closely monitoring its progress and considering how they too can follow suit. As we look ahead at our collective journey towards a more environmentally-conscious world, it seems fitting that this small alpine nation may hold some of the answers we seek.  It appears that by weaving together environmental awareness with financial acumen, Switzerland might just become the model for achieving true harmony between economy and ecology – not only on its own turf but globally as well.",create
"The Future of Swiss Interest Rates: A Global Outlook  Switzerland's reputation as a global financial hub has long been founded on its open economy and safe haven currency. However, recent developments on the international stage have left the Alpine nation bracing itself for significant implications. As European financial markets experience turbulence, Switzerland finds itself grappling with historic lows in interest rates and plummeting inflation figures.  At present, Switzerland boasts the unenviable position of having the lowest interest rate structure of any country in the world. This unprecedented situation has resulted in negative yields on Swiss government bonds that extend up to five years. Even 30-year government bonds are offering yields of less than 1 percent, reflecting a flat curve that is cause for concern among economists and investors alike.  According to recent data, ten-year bond yields recently struck a new low at an astonishingly meager 0.49 percent – painting a bleak picture for savers and borrowers across the nation. But what factors have contributed to this downward spiral? Let us explore further.  One key element is undoubtedly Switzerland's close economic ties with Europe. As uncertainties surrounding Brexit loom large over continental Europe, investors have flocked towards safer assets such as the Swiss franc – further driving down interest rates within Switzerland's borders. The perceived stability offered by both its currency and banking sector has positioned it favorably in times of regional volatility.  However, this flood of capital into Switzerland carries both advantages and drawbacks. While it bolsters demand for Swiss francs – thus strengthening its value against other currencies – it simultaneously exerts downward pressure on domestic interest rates due to excessive capital inflows into an already highly liquid market.  Another factor contributing to these record-low interest rates is inflation – or rather deflation - which currently stands at -1 percent. Inflation measures serve as directional indicators for central banks when deciding appropriate monetary policy actions such as adjusting interest rates or implementing quantitative easing programs; however, persistently low inflation rates exert additional downward pressure on already depressed interest rates.  Despite these challenging circumstances, experts within the field remain confident in Switzerland's ability to navigate this storm. They argue that a proactive approach must be taken by national authorities to ensure that the economy can withstand external shocks and maintain stability.  One potential strategy to counter these record-low interest rates is quantitative easing (QE). Through this policy intervention, central banks increase the supply of money in circulation by purchasing government bonds. By doing so, they aim to stimulate lending and investment activities as well as boost overall economic growth.  However, adopting such measures requires careful consideration. While QE may provide an initial boost to the economy through increased liquidity, it also carries potential risks - such as asset price bubbles or market distortions - if implemented without prudence and oversight.  Furthermore, with limited room for maneuver given existing negative interest rates and fears over long-term sustainability with regards to excessive borrowing costs coupled with a stagnant global economy post-pandemic crisis - particularly within major economies like Japan or Europe where negative interest rate policies have been employed – Switzerland must tread cautiously in charting its monetary path forward.  Looking ahead, much uncertainty remains surrounding Swiss interest rates. As global economic conditions fluctuate unpredictably in response to internal political dynamics and external forces beyond control - geopolitical tensions heighten or financial markets experience heightened volatility; policymakers face considerable challenges when determining optimal levels for managing domestic economic stability over timeframes ranging from short-terms cyclical ups-and-downs up through longer-range secular trends shaping opportunities & threats across multiple dimensions like productivity growth rates versus demographic shifts which could impact decisions related not just our current situation but potentially any future scenario imaginable given sufficient analysis combined alongside creative imagination being applied towards same goal shared among all stakeholders involved whether their interests align today remain committed tomorrow or advocate different strategies based upon diverging objectives flowing recommended evidence quality into sound policy making we're considering here from current policy perspective on flip side gate same risks proactively addressed critical for informed discussion future strategies likely maximize welfare society large taking into account feasible trade-offs presented understanding consequences potential alternatives under consideration only possible when evaluating multiple perspectives including those often overlooked or discounted by default assumption factors ascertain uncertainties persistently low inflation rates exert additional downward pressure already depressed interest rates significance these considerations give rise importance recognizing specific circumstances relate Swiss economy's openness vulnerability influences such varying factors affect domestic markets holistic global perspective.

"Title: Analyzing Eyewitness Testimonies: Implications for Legal Proceedings  Introduction: In a groundbreaking study conducted by the renowned Institute of Legal Research, experts have uncovered intriguing insights into the reliability of eyewitness testimonies in court cases. The findings shed new light on the complexities surrounding witness identifications and their impact on legal proceedings. As we delve into this fascinating research, it becomes increasingly evident that our justice system must evolve to ensure fair and accurate outcomes.  Examining the Study: The study delved into an accident involving a taxi at night in a bustling metropolis served by two prominent cab companies – Green and Blue Taxis. According to available data, approximately 85 percent of taxis belonged to the Green company while 15 percent fell under the jurisdiction of Blue Taxis.  In this specific case, a witness identified the taxi involved in the accident as blue. Intriguingly, researchers discovered that when presented with two color options - green or blue under similar lighting conditions as during the incident - witnesses accurately identified each color 80 percent of the time but failed 20 percent of the time.  Implications for Justice: These findings raise pressing questions about how witness testimonies impact legal proceedings where identification plays a pivotal role. With wrongful convictions being an unfortunate reality, such research is critical in evaluating whether eyewitness accounts alone should be considered conclusive evidence.  Historically, courts have placed significant weight on eyewitness testimonies due to their perceived trustworthiness. However, this study suggests caution regarding overreliance on such accounts and highlights potential flaws within our criminal justice system.  The Importance of Context: To ensure greater accuracy, legal scholars argue that context is key when assessing eyewitness identifications. In this regard, further research is required to examine factors such as lighting conditions during incidents or possible biases related to trauma or stress levels experienced by witnesses at crime scenes.  Proposed Reforms: In light of these developments, legal experts are now calling for a comprehensive reevaluation of justice systems globally. The incorporation of scientific principles in analyzing witness accounts, including rigorous testing of lighting conditions during identification tests, is one suggestion stemming from this study.  Moreover, some proponents argue that the establishment of standardized procedures in collecting eyewitness testimonies may yield more reliable results. Comprehensive training programs for law enforcement officials tasked with gathering such evidence could help minimize potential biases and errors.  Conclusion: As we continue to strive for a fair and just society, understanding the limitations associated with eyewitness testimonies is crucial. This groundbreaking study conducted by the Institute of Legal Research serves as an essential step towards reshaping our legal systems worldwide.  While acknowledging that these findings warrant further exploration and validation through additional research, it is clear that adopting evidence-based practices will contribute to more accurate legal outcomes. By embracing a balanced approach that factors in context and applies scientific methodologies in assessing witness identifications, we can aspire to strengthen our justice systems while protecting innocent individuals from unwarranted incarceration or conviction.

In recent years, classic car auctions and exhibitions have been popping up across China, further fueling the passion for vintage automobiles. Auction houses such as Bonhams and Sotheby's have cashed in on this trend by holding high-profile events that attract collectors from all walks of life. Never before has there been such demand for classics like the iconic Porsche 911 or the illustrious Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing.  Numerous Chinese entrepreneurs have also jumped on the bandwagon, investing heavily in restoring and displaying these automotive treasures. Not only do these entrepreneurs find solace in preserving artifacts from a bygone era, but they have also realized that these investments can yield remarkable returns over time.  While some may argue that this growing obsession with vintage luxury cars is merely another facet of China's consumer culture, others see it as a way for individuals to reconnect with their heritage while embracing modernity. By embracing classic automobiles, individuals are not just acquiring objects; they are participating in an immersive experience that transcends time and place.  As The Classic Car Paradise continues to captivate visitors with its awe-inspiring collection week after week, it serves as a testament to China's insatiable thirst for luxury - whether it be shopping at glamorous malls or indulging in the rich history of vintage luxury cars.  Indeed, Sunday in Shanghai has become synonymous not only with shopping but also with immersing oneself in an unparalleled world where prestige meets passion—an emblematic symbol of China's evolving taste and enduring pursuit of excellence.

"The New Era of Technological Advancements: Transforming the Global Economy  In recent years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented wave of technological advancements. From artificial intelligence to virtual reality, these innovations have permeated every aspect of our lives, reshaping industries and revolutionizing traditional business models. As we embark on this new era of digitization and automation, a fundamental economic transformation is poised to unfold in the global economy.  Traditionally, the United States has served as the main driver of global economic growth through its consumer spending power. However, with mounting debt levels and reduced household wealth due to the aftermath of the financial crisis, a shift is occurring. The emerging market consumer is rising in prominence and replacing their American counterpart on the global stage.  Historically overlooked by multinational corporations as mere production hubs or recipients of foreign aid, emerging markets now boast growing middle-class populations with increasing disposable incomes. With rising affluence comes changing consumption patterns and preferences. These newly minted consumers are not only demanding access to modern products but also seeking investment opportunities.  Take China as an example – its booming middle class has been portrayed as one that craves luxury goods from designer fashion labels like Louis Vuitton or Bentley automobiles. While this remains true for some segment of Chinese society, there is another narrative: a burgeoning desire for cutting-edge technology.  Chinese consumers are fueling demand for innovative gadgets such as smartphones equipped with advanced artificial intelligence features or home automation systems that allow individuals to control their appliances remotely via smartphone applications. Industry experts predict that by 2025, China's spending on technology-related products will surpass that of any other country in the world – including the United States.  This paradigm shift presents immense opportunities for businesses worldwide. Companies need to reassess their strategies and reallocate resources to tap into these promising emerging markets' potential actively. Having long relied on Western markets for growth prospects may no longer suffice in this new landscape.  To succeed in the emerging market arena, firms must adapt their products and services to cater specifically to the needs and desires of these consumers. Localizing marketing campaigns, establishing strong distribution networks, and building brand equity tailored to regional preferences are essential steps for companies seeking traction in these markets.  However, it's not just about adapting existing products; it's also about innovation. Emerging markets have become fertile grounds for entrepreneurs and startups looking to disrupt traditional industries. These newcomers are leveraging advanced technologies such as blockchain or renewable energy solutions to create localized solutions that address unique challenges faced by these regions.  One prime example is Kenya's booming fintech sector – a consequence of limited banking infrastructure in rural areas. Through the use of mobile technology, Kenyan entrepreneurs have developed innovative digital payment systems that allow individuals without access to traditional banks to perform financial transactions seamlessly.  As this economic transformation continues, it is crucial for policymakers, investors, and companies alike to recognize the potential impact on global growth dynamics. While it may be tempting for established economies like the United States or European nations with long-standing traditions of consumerism dominance to dismiss this shift as inconsequential or temporary - doing so could prove shortsighted.  The rise of emerging market consumers offers an opportunity for enhanced economic collaboration across regions rather than competition based on outdated models. Building mutually beneficial partnerships can harness complementarities between Western technological prowess and emerging market consumer demand – creating sustainable growth opportunities globally.  In conclusion, we find ourselves standing at a crossroads where technological advancements drive a paradigm shift in global economic growth drivers. The emergence of new consumer forces from emerging markets presents both challenges and opportunities for businesses worldwide. To stay ahead in this evolving landscape requires adaptability, innovation-driven mindset, and appreciation of diverse consumer expectations across borders – hallmarks that will define success in our interconnected world economy going forward.

"Title: The Rise of Fintech Startups Enhances Switzerland's Financial Center  Author: Sarah Fischer  In recent years, the Swiss financial center has witnessed a remarkable transformation driven by the emergence of a growing number of fintech startups. These innovative ventures are rapidly reshaping the landscape and bolstering Switzerland's reputation as a global hub for cutting-edge financial technology.  The increasing presence and influence of fintech startups are transforming traditional banking practices, challenging established institutions, and attracting significant attention from investors worldwide. These agile disruptors are redefining how financial services are delivered, offering innovative solutions that streamline processes while maintaining high security standards.  Switzerland has always been known for its robust banking system, strict regulations, and commitment to data privacy. Now, with the rise of these fintech pioneers who leverage state-of-the-art technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), the country's financial sector finds itself at an exciting crossroads.  One particularly noteworthy startup making waves in Switzerland is SwissFinTech Ltd., founded by Martin Weber. This Zurich-based company specializes in digital payment solutions for small businesses and individuals alike. Their user-friendly app allows seamless transactions without exorbitant fees or delays typically associated with traditional banks.  ""We saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between innovation-driven technology and finance,"" says Weber about his venture. ""By focusing on customer needs rather than preserving outdated practices, we're working towards creating a more inclusive financial ecosystem.""  While many see these tech-savvy newcomers as potential disruptors to established players in the industry, some experts assert that they could instead act as catalysts for collaborations that fuel growth across sectors.  ""Rather than fearing disruption from fintech companies, established banks should actively seek partnerships with them,"" suggests Thomas Meiermanns, author of ""Banking Innovations: Adapt or Perish."" ""Their fresh perspective can help traditional institutions adapt quicker to market demands.""  To foster such partnerships between incumbent banks and agile fintech startups, the Swiss government has taken a proactive stance. Initiatives like the Fintech+ Accelerator Program offer support to emerging companies through mentorship, funding, and access to an extensive network of industry leaders.  Recognizing the potential synergies between incumbents and disruptors, Credit Suisse recently launched its own fintech lab. The initiative aims to harness innovation by collaborating with startups focused on areas such as robo-advisory services and digital asset management.  ""We believe that when traditional financial institutions embrace technology-driven solutions instead of resisting them, it creates a win-win situation for both customers and banks,"" comments Michael Gruber, Head of Digital Strategy at Credit Suisse.  The Swiss financial center's ability to adapt quickly has also attracted talented entrepreneurs from abroad who recognize the country's potential for growth in fintech. This influx of international talent adds diversity and expertise to an already strong workforce.  Moreover, increased collaboration between academia and industry has ensured that Switzerland remains at the forefront of technological advancements in finance. Prestigious universities such as ETH Zurich and EPFL have joined forces with key players from both traditional banking and fintech sectors to drive groundbreaking research initiatives.  As Switzerland continues its journey towards becoming a global leader in fintech innovation, experts emphasize that nurturing talent through sustainable regulatory frameworks will be crucial. Strict compliance measures combined with a supportive environment for experimentation will enable new ideas to flourish while maintaining stability within the financial system.  In conclusion, Switzerland's financial center is rapidly evolving thanks to the dynamic influence of pioneering fintech ventures. By embracing innovation while preserving its traditional strengths in regulation and privacy protection, Switzerland is poised to shape tomorrow's global finance landscape while ensuring national prosperity well into the future.",create
"Russia's Economy Set to Benefit from Strong Relations with China  Olga Petrova: As the world focuses on the recent election of President Dmitry Medvedev and its implications for Russia's future, another significant development may have slipped under the radar: Russia's increasingly strong economic ties with China.  In recent years, China has become one of Russia's most important trading partners. The two countries have deepened their cooperation across various sectors, including energy, infrastructure, and technology. Now, experts believe that this strong relationship could help propel Russia's economy to even greater heights.  One key area where this partnership is flourishing is in energy collaboration. Russia has long been a major energy supplier to Europe, but now it seeks to diversify its customer base. With China hungry for natural resources to support its rapid economic growth, there is a natural fit between the two nations. Just last year, Russia signed a historic 30-year deal worth $400 billion with China to supply natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline.  This landmark agreement not only secures a consistent demand for Russian gas but also provides much-needed investment in infrastructure development. The Power of Siberia project involves building thousands of kilometers of pipelines across rugged terrain and will create employment opportunities for both Russian and Chinese workers.  Furthermore, collaboration between Russian and Chinese companies has expanded into other crucial sectors as well. Technology innovation holds great potential for both countries as they strive to remain competitive in an increasingly digitalized world. By combining Russian expertise in fields such as aerospace engineering and nuclear energy with Chinese advances in AI and telecommunications, they can develop cutting-edge products together that meet global demands.  The close ties between Moscow and Beijing extend beyond commerce; they also share strategic geopolitical interests. As the relationship between Russia-Western nations remains tense due to political differences on various global issues, including Ukraine and Syria among others - both Moscow and Beijing have found common ground when it comes to protecting their national interests during these turbulent times. This has translated into increased military cooperation and joint exercises, bolstering mutual trust and stability in the region.  While the Russian government will continue to maintain a proactive role in shaping its economic policies, the potential benefits of this burgeoning partnership with China cannot be understated. The country's strong growth trajectory is set to receive an additional boost as Russian businesses tap into the vast Chinese market, coupled with access to advanced technologies and expertise.  However, as with any collaboration between nations, challenges remain. Both Russia and China must navigate complex issues such as intellectual property rights protections and market access barriers. Nevertheless, it is clear that their shared vision for economic advancement strengthens their resolve to overcome these obstacles.  As President Medvedev assumes his role at the helm of Russia's leadership, he inherits not only a strong foundation built by his predecessor but also an exciting opportunity for further growth through enhanced ties with China. The world will be watching closely how this relationship unfolds and its implications for global trade dynamics.  The Credit Suisse Bulletin will continue monitoring this captivating development within Russia's economic landscape as we explore the intricacies of this Russo-China alliance in subsequent discussions based on interviews with key stakeholders from both nations' public and private sectors",create

"New Perspectives on Bulgaria's Thriving Tech Sector  To much jubilation among their peoples, Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. In the European Parliament, president of the EU Commission José Manuel Barroso had already welcomed their accession as a historic achievement. Back in Bulgaria, virtually no one would disagree with his words: All the more so because the transition from centrally planned economy to democratically run market economy was tantamount to a history-laden obstacle course - one involving a surprise change of administration, record inflation, and corruption scandals. ""But this was a turning point,"" says leading economist Dr. Katerina Dimitrova.  Fast forward more than a decade later and Bulgaria is emerging as an unexpected innovation powerhouse in Europe's tech scene. Nestled between Greece and Turkey in Southeastern Europe, this nation is quietly becoming known for nurturing tech talent and fostering high-growth startups that are turning heads worldwide.  While industries such as tourism and agriculture have long dominated Bulgaria's economy, recent government initiatives aimed at fostering technology-driven innovation have begun bearing fruit. The country has invested heavily in building state-of-the-art infrastructure to support entrepreneurship and digitalization.  Bulgaria's young population plays a significant role in its tech sector success story. With approximately half of its population under 40 years old, it boasts a skilled workforce that embraces technological advancements with enthusiasm and determination. Bulgarian universities produce thousands of highly educated graduates each year who are eager to contribute to their country's growing digital landscape.  The city of Sofia has emerged as the epicenter of this technological awakening within Bulgaria. Home to vibrant co-working spaces like Sofia Tech Park where entrepreneurs can collaborate freely on groundbreaking ideas without financial burden or bureaucratic red tape slowing them down.  One notable example is VitaMind Software Solutions—a Bulgarian startup that created an innovative mental health application aimed at revolutionizing therapy accessibility worldwide using artificial intelligence (AI). Co-founded by Ivana Ivanova and Georgi Georgiev, the app uses AI algorithms to deliver personalized therapy sessions at a fraction of the cost of traditional mental health services. VitaMind's mission is to address the global shortage of mental health professionals by offering accessible tools for those seeking support.  Bulgaria's investment in strengthening its tech ecosystem has not gone unnoticed by global industry leaders. International tech giants like Google and SAP have established offices in Sofia, taking advantage of the country's skilled workforce and favorable business environment. Meanwhile, investors from across Europe are pouring their capital into Bulgarian startups with high growth potential.  The success stories are not limited to software development either. Bulgaria has also earned a reputation for hardware innovation. Take, for instance, Deep Optics—a pioneering company that designs smart lenses capable of adjusting focus automatically depending on users' needs. With their innovative approach to vision correction technology, they have caught the attention of eyewear manufacturers worldwide.  While Bulgaria's rise as a tech hub is remarkable given its communist past and economic challenges during transition periods, experts believe this transformation is just getting started. Driven by supportive government policies, talented individuals eager to make their mark on the world stage, and an unwavering entrepreneurial spirit deep-rooted in the nation's DNA – Bulgaria seems poised to become an even more prominent player in Europe’s flourishing tech landscape.  As investors increasingly recognize Bulgaria as a hotbed for innovation opportunities, it remains crucial for policymakers to ensure sustainable growth through continued investments in research and development (R&D), infrastructure development initiatives such as improved broadband connectivity throughout rural areas.  In conclusion: while many may still associate Bulgaria with historical challenges faced during its transition into democracy; it would be wise not overlook this dynamo now delivering groundbreaking advancements within Europe’s digital realm after successfully navigating through troubled waters—it seems this phoenix has truly risen from the ashes!",create
"The Delicate Art of Balancing Connectivity and Privacy  In today's technologically-driven world, one might argue that connectivity is the greatest thing we have at our disposal. The ability to stay connected 24/7, whether through social media, email or mobile phones, has revolutionized the way we communicate. But amidst this constant buzz of connectivity, have we lost touch with what truly matters – meaningful human connection?  Renowned Swiss musician Reto Bieri seems to think so. In a recent interview with the Credit Suisse Bulletin, Bieri expressed his reservations about the ever-increasing intrusion of technology in our lives. ""No, thank goodness not yet,"" he exclaimed when asked if he owned a mobile phone. ""The ability of people to reach me at any time would be unbearable.""  Bieri's perspective challenges conventional wisdom in an age where being constantly accessible is considered essential for both personal and professional success. However, his argument delves deeper than mere preference; it questions the very essence of connectivity and its impact on authentic human interactions.  ""I don't think a mobile phone would connect me with more people,"" Bieri explains earnestly. ""On the contrary - I believe that it actually distances you from them even more.""  But how can increased availability lead to greater disconnection? Well, as Bieri suggests, there is something irreplaceable about meeting face-to-face – experiencing genuine human connection devoid of emojis and abbreviated messages.  ""In my view,"" says Bieri passionately, ""meeting with people is essential."" It is this belief that fuels his excitement for his career as a musician - a profession he describes as being akin to ""a living spotlight shining on things.""  Bieri sees himself as someone who creates an arena for bringing people together; an individual who facilitates genuine encounters through his music. And it is precisely this focus on creating shared experiences that allows him to cultivate profound connections outside the digital realm.  While it may be tempting to dismiss Bieri's perspective as outdated or unrealistic, it is important to acknowledge the underlying concerns he raises. In an era where likes, comments, and shares have become the currency of validation, finding a balance between connectivity and authentic human connection has arguably never been more crucial.  As society grapples with these ideological tensions, individuals are increasingly seeking out spaces that prioritize real-life encounters over virtual ones. From co-working spaces designed to foster collaboration to coffee shops encouraging face-to-face conversation by providing Wi-Fi-free zones, there is a growing recognition of the value in taking a pause from constant connectivity.  Credit Suisse itself recognizes this need for balance. In recent years, the bank has implemented initiatives aimed at fostering meaningful connections among employees and clients. From curated networking events that bring together like-minded professionals to mindfulness workshops promoting introspection and self-reflection – Credit Suisse understands that true connection lies beyond mere online interactions.  So how can we strike this delicate balance between embracing connectivity without losing sight of genuine human connection? The answer lies in establishing boundaries - carving out moments for pause amidst the constant stream of notifications and updates.  It is through these pauses that we rediscover what Bieri refers to as ""the greatest thing in the world"" – authentic human interaction free from distractions. By recognizing when it's time to unplug from our devices and engage in meaningful conversations or shared experiences, we create opportunities for rich connections that endure long after our screens dim.  In conclusion, Reto Bieri's viewpoint challenges us all to reflect on our relationship with technology and its impact on genuine human connection. While continuous connectivity offers unparalleled convenience and efficiency, it should not come at the expense of those experiences which make life truly worth living: moments of heartfelt communication with others. As we navigate an increasingly connected world, let us remember the importance of pausing - both literally and metaphorically - so that we may savor those infinitely valuable moments where real connections are forged.",create
"When Tradition Meets Innovation: The New Wave of Water-Powered Timepieces  At the outset, many regarded it as a mere fantasy, a whimsical idea borne out of an imaginative mind. Pioneering entrepreneurs have never had an easy time navigating the treacherous waters of skepticism and doubt. Yet, it was at Expo.02 that Lucien Vouillamoz dared to unveil his vision - a mechanical wristwatch powered by water to indicate the passage of time. Needless to say, he encountered raised eyebrows and incredulous glances from those around him.  Water clocks, although ancient devices used for centuries on end, hinge on gravity - with water cascading from a higher vessel into a lower one much like sand in an hourglass. Nevertheless, Vouillamoz envisioned something different – a departure from tradition that combined the age-old concept of water-powered time-telling with cutting-edge innovation.  Fast forward to today; Vouillamoz's ambitious dream has become reality as watchmakers stride into uncharted territory where craftsmanship meets technology.

The fusion of water-powered mechanisms with the finest materials meticulously handcrafted by seasoned artisans epitomizes the art and science behind these mechanical marvels.  The beauty of these timepieces goes beyond their ability to mesmerize. By harnessing the power of water, they symbolically pay homage to Switzerland's rich heritage while simultaneously embracing a sustainable future. Fueled solely by this life-giving element, each watch metaphorically embraces environmental consciousness and challenges industry norms in pursuit of a cleaner and greener horological landscape.  Indeed, these watches have far-reaching implications beyond aesthetics; they encapsulate sustainable progress while bridging the gap between tradition and innovation. Furthermore, this remarkable achievement echoes louder than words when it comes to technological advancements as Swiss manufacturers continually raise the bar within an ever-evolving marketplace.  As we delve further into an era driven by conscious consumerism, consumers seek products that are not only exquisitely crafted but also imbued with purpose - products that go beyond surface value and reflect their own values. These water-powered timepieces personify just such a concept: instruments capable of adding a sense of wonderment to daily lives while undeniably serving as catalysts for conversation surrounding sustainability.  As Lucien Vouillamoz himself once stated during that pivotal moment at Expo.02: ""Water represents the very essence of life – it sustains us all."" With each tick and tock resonating through its veins like invisible currents coursing through our existence, these innovative marvels honor tradition while propelling us towards an enlightened tomorrow where even time flows sustainably – like water itself.  In conclusion, this new chapter within horology sets pulses racing as Swiss watchmakers masterfully navigate uncharted waters with their enchanting creations. It begs the question: what else lies on the horizon for wristwatches powered by nature's most precious resource?",create
"Economy Poised for a Comeback: Swiss Voters Embrace Optimism  In the wake of a tumultuous year, Swiss voters are displaying signs of renewed optimism about the country's economic prospects. A recent survey conducted by Credit Suisse indicates a shift in sentiment, with respondents showing more faith in Switzerland's overall economic situation compared to previous years.  Despite facing numerous challenges and uncertainties, the Swiss economy appears to be on a steady path towards recovery. The Credit Suisse Worry Barometer demonstrates that while optimism levels have not significantly risen from last year, there has been a notable decline in pessimism among voters.  According to the findings, only 20 percent of respondents expressed confidence that Switzerland's overall economic situation would improve within the next 12 months. While this might seem like a modest figure at first glance, it represents progress when compared to last year's figure of 21 percent. This slight increase suggests that voters are cautiously optimistic about future economic developments.  Interestingly, an even smaller percentage (18 percent) believes their personal situations will witness improvement within the same period. However, it is important to note that this figure has decreased slightly from 22 percent recorded in the previous survey cycle. While individually citizens may be more reserved regarding their personal circumstances, they seem hopeful about broader trends impacting Switzerland as a whole.  The reasons behind this collective rise in optimism can be attributed to several factors shaping today's economic landscape. First and foremost is Switzerland's proven ability to weather storms successfully in previous crises – notably between 2008 and 2011. This resilience instills confidence not only among businesses but also households across all sectors of society.  Additionally, ongoing vaccination efforts against COVID-19 have injected hope into the Swiss economy as restrictions start easing gradually. With an increasing number of individuals immunized against the virus and infection rates declining across the country; consumers are beginning to regain trust and return their focus towards pre-pandemic activities such as spending and investment.  Furthermore, the recovery witnessed in several sectors, including manufacturing and exports, is also contributing to overall positive sentiment. Switzerland's reputation for high-quality goods remains intact, allowing businesses to capitalize on overseas demand. As major economies worldwide bounce back from pandemic-induced disruptions, Swiss industries stand to benefit from increased trade opportunities.  To maintain this upward trajectory and ensure sustainable growth, policymakers continue to implement measures promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. The government's commitment to research and development initiatives has positioned Switzerland as a global leader in technology advancements, further bolstering confidence among voters who understand the importance of staying ahead in a rapidly evolving world.  Nevertheless, it is essential not to overlook potential risks that may still lie ahead. While public sentiment appears favorable now, international trade tensions and unforeseen setbacks could dampen current optimism levels. Additionally, keeping a close eye on global economic developments will be crucial due to Switzerland's interconnectedness with markets worldwide.  As Swiss voters embrace their newfound sense of optimism towards the economy's future prospects cautiously; it provides an opportunity for individuals and businesses alike to proactively contribute towards rebuilding a strong economic foundation post-pandemic. With careful planning, prudent decision-making by stakeholders across various sectors can support sustained growth while mitigating potential challenges along the way.  In conclusion, Swiss voters are displaying an increasingly positive outlook regarding the nation's economic landscape. Building upon past success stories while remaining mindful of potential pitfalls will pave the way for continued progress in the coming months. As vaccination efforts advance and restrictions ease further nationwide – alongside ongoing commitment towards innovation – Switzerland is poised for an optimistic future marked by resilience amidst changing times.

His interpretations are incredibly moving, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have secured tickets to what promises to be an unforgettable evening.""  Indeed, it is not just seasoned classical music enthusiasts who are buzzing with anticipation; younger generations inspired by Casals' virtuosity and emotional depth eagerly await his performance as well.  ""I've always loved playing Bach's Cello Suite No. 1,"" shares Ivan Martinez, a young cellist from Madrid. ""But hearing Pablo Casals play it live? That's a dream come true!""  As an artist renowned for nurturing emerging talent throughout his career, Casals has also set aside time during his visit to Vienna for mentoring sessions with aspiring musicians selected by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna.  ""We recognize that supporting future generations of musicians is just as vital,"" remarks Angyan. ""Casals' commitment to cultivating young talent aligns perfectly with our long-standing mission.""  Adding another layer of excitement to this already momentous occasion is the recent unveiling of a specially commissioned work composed by acclaimed contemporary composer Sofia Ramirez. This world premiere will accompany Casals' repertoire, showcasing an intriguing fusion of classical and modern influences.  Ramirez describes her composition as ""an homage to both tradition and innovation—a musical bridge between eras."" Her piece aims to convey profound emotions while challenging conventional boundaries—an artistic tribute that mirrors Casals' own dedication toward pushing artistic boundaries throughout his career.  As the concert date rapidly approaches, the atmosphere in Vienna grows increasingly electrifying. With notable personalities and dignitaries scheduled to attend, this gathering of passionate music lovers promises to be an unforgettable convergence of talent and appreciation for the arts.  Leading up to the event, Credit Suisse will also host a series of intimate discussions and workshops with Casals himself, providing a unique opportunity for select clients and industry insiders to gain insights into his artistic process and learn from his wealth of experience.  ""Our collaboration with Pablo Casals underscores Credit Suisse's commitment to fostering creativity,"" Schadler emphasizes. ""We believe that by bringing together exceptional individuals like him with diverse audiences, we can help inspire new ideas and perspectives.""  As anticipation reaches its peak, all eyes are on Vienna—awaiting the moment when Pablo Casals takes center stage at the prestigious Musikverein concert hall. In what promises to be an evening etched into classical music history books forever, one thing is certain: this extraordinary event will leave an indelible mark on both performers and audience members alike—a testament to the transformative power of art.",create
"""Oriental"" Finance Takes Global Markets by Storm  In a ground-breaking move, the inaugural issuance of a Sukuk in the Islamic financial market by an American bank has sent shockwaves across the global economy. This fixed-income product, compliant with the requirements of Sharia law, has not only captured the attention of investors but also opened up new avenues for finance in uncertain times.  With its colossal 2 billion US dollar size, this bold initiative comes as a beacon of hope amidst an ongoing financial crisis. The timing is significant and speaks volumes about the potential latent within Islamic finance to revolutionize the global markets.  Sukuk, commonly referred to as ""Islamic bonds,"" are structured products that allow investors to participate in profit-sharing arrangements rather than traditional interest-based returns. This fundamental tenet aligns with Sharia principles that prohibit charging or paying interest as it is considered exploitative and contrary to Islamic ideals.  While Sukuk have been established instruments in countries like Malaysia for decades, their presence on Wall Street marks a historic moment for Islamic finance penetrating Western markets. The entry of a leading American bank into this domain reflects both growing investor appetite for ethical investment options and mainstream acceptance towards diverse financial models.  The reception from investors has been overwhelming so far. Global asset managers have lauded this development as they seek innovative ways to diversify portfolios during these challenging times. Notably, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are among those actively investing in Sukuk due to their stable returns combined with social responsibility considerations.  This landmark event provides invaluable opportunities not only for investors but also bridges cultures through mutual understanding and respect. The success of this milestone augurs well for future collaborations between East and West - two powerhouse regions driving today's interconnected world economy.  With burgeoning demand from environmental sustainability-conscious investors seeking responsible investment vehicles globally - dubbed ""green finance"" - experts are turning their attention toward green Sukuk as another avenue ripe with potential growth opportunity. These offerings could pave the way for the integration of environmentally friendly projects into Islamic finance, addressing pressing ecological concerns while promoting economic development.  The convergence of ""oriental"" finance with global markets is not only a testament to the resilience and adaptability of Islamic finance in times of uncertainty but it also underscores the universal appeal and relevance it holds for investors seeking alternative avenues beyond conventional banking practices. This bold capstone challenges traditional perceptions and expands boundaries within our ever-evolving financial landscape.  As we witness this historic leap in Islamic finance's global footprint, it is crucial for financial institutions, regulators, and market participants worldwide to embrace this seminal moment. Recognizing these milestones as transformative opportunities will not only foster economic growth but also pave the way for greater inclusion in modern banking practices.  In conclusion, this trailblazing Sukuk issuance by an American bank defies expectations during turbulent times. It signifies a powerful shift towards a more ethical and inclusive financial future. As history unfolds before us, let us acknowledge that embracing diverse financial models can ignite extraordinary opportunities for collective prosperity – an ideal that transcends borders and brings communities closer together on a path towards sustainable growth.",create
"Switzerland to Implement New Technological Solutions to Strengthen Financial Center  Switzerland, renowned for its strong financial center and safe haven status, is set to embrace new technological advancements in order to maintain its competitive edge in the global market. Amidst increasing international competition, Swiss authorities and financial institutions are actively exploring innovative solutions that could revolutionize the country's financial services industry.  In a recent report published by Credit Suisse, it was highlighted that Switzerland, despite being ranked among the top 10 global financial centers and weathering the storm of the 2008 global financial crisis admirably well, cannot afford complacency. The traditional mix of financial services that have served as pillars of Swiss banking for decades is now facing unprecedented pressure.  Recognizing this challenge, Switzerland has embarked on an ambitious plan to leverage technology for resilience and adaptability. The Swiss government has committed substantial resources towards research and development efforts aimed at enhancing digital infrastructure within the financial sector. This move signifies a strategic shift towards embracing cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analytics.  One area where Switzerland aims to pioneer technological innovation is in wealth management - an industry where it already commands a significant share of more than a quarter in the global cross-border market. With trust being central to Swiss banking success, utilizing these advanced technologies will further cement their reputation as a reliable partner for wealthy individuals seeking security for their assets.  Blockchain technology, particularly known for its decentralized nature and secure transactions through smart contracts, holds immense potential in revolutionizing wealth management practices. By providing transparent records of ownership without intermediaries or centralized control, blockchain can enhance efficiency while reducing costs associated with cross-border transactions.  Artificial intelligence is another game-changer that Switzerland seeks to harness. AI-powered algorithms can assist asset managers in making more informed investment decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data from various sources instantaneously; thus enabling personalized portfolio allocation tailored according to individual client preferences.  Moreover, machine learning can facilitate more accurate risk assessment models, enabling financial institutions to better evaluate investment opportunities and manage potential threats. This increased efficiency will not only benefit existing clients but also attract new investors seeking optimal returns with reduced risk exposure.  While Switzerland's commitment to embracing technology is commendable, the task ahead is not without challenges. Incorporating advanced technologies into existing frameworks requires careful consideration of regulatory implications, data protection measures, and cybersecurity concerns. Collaboration between authorities, regulatory bodies, and financial institutions will be crucial in ensuring a seamless integration of these transformative solutions while upholding the highest standards of security and privacy.  This paradigm shift towards digitalization within the Swiss financial sector also presents immense opportunities for collaboration between established financial institutions and fintech startups. Partnership models that merge traditional banking expertise with agile tech-driven innovation have proven successful in other markets around the world.  Switzerland has long been synonymous with stability and security in banking. Now it must seize this momentous opportunity to combine its trusted reputation with cutting-edge technology to stay not just relevant but ahead in an increasingly competitive global market. By leveraging advancements such as blockchain, AI, ML, and big data analytics effectively - Switzerland can continue to offer unparalleled services that meet the ever-evolving needs of its clientele while maintaining its status as one of the preeminent global financial centers.  As Switzerland charges forward on this path towards digital transformation within its financial sector through technological solutions deployed intelligently—and by fostering strategic partnerships—it aims to secure a promising future where tradition meets innovation for the benefit of clients both old and new alike.

"Title: Global GDP Slows Down Despite Positive Projections  When it comes to the state of the global economy, there is a mixed bag of news to report. Credit Suisse economists are forecasting a 3.3 percent increase in global GDP this year, which represents an improvement over the previous year's 2.9 percent growth. However, the underlying concern lies in the fact that even with this upward trend, growth continues to hover around the 40-year average of 3.4 percent.  In normal circumstances, during a period of economic recovery, one would expect growth rates to exceed this long-term average. The fact that they haven't raised questions about potential GDP and its implications for global economies.  Potential GDP signifies an economy's maximum sustainable output level while maintaining stable inflationary trends and balanced fiscal policies. It reflects an idealistic state where all resources are fully utilized — both labor and capital — to maximize production efficiency without causing inflationary pressures or straining labor markets.  However, data suggests that many economies are currently operating below their potential output levels globally. This implies untapped opportunities for enhanced growth rates in various sectors across multiple countries.  To better understand this phenomenon, we can explore emerging markets such as India and Brazil where substantial potential for higher economic performance awaits harnessing. The Indian economy has been grappling with deep-rooted structural challenges impeding its ability to reach its full capacity.  India's demographic dividend promises substantial labor productivity gains; however, shortcomings in education infrastructure have hampered skill development necessary for driving innovation-driven industries forward. Similarly in Brazil, vested interests and political uncertainty have hindered reforms necessary for unlocking greater productivity and realizing their full economic potential.  In advanced economies like Japan and parts of Europe as well as North America itself—measured against their pre-crisis periods—the challenge lies more in stimulating demand rather than boosting supply-side efficiencies like emerging markets face. Countries such as Japan face population aging issues leading to a significant decline in the workforce, which hampers its potential GDP growth. Structural reforms, including labor market flexibility and incentivizing productivity-enhancing investments, could help boost their economies towards full potential.  For mature economies like Germany or the United States, persistent structural inefficiencies can hamper progress. Inefficient regulations surrounding labor markets and bureaucracy can stifle entrepreneurial activities and innovation that could otherwise propel these economies forward.  To overcome these challenges collectively, governments must focus on implementing comprehensive structural reforms tailored to their country's unique circumstances. Streamlining bureaucracy, investing in human capital through education and skill development programs, fostering innovation through research and development incentives – all measures can help unleash an economy's true potential for sustainable long-term growth.  Additionally, governments should consider addressing income disparities to ensure that economic benefits are more evenly distributed. This approach not only promotes social stability but also encourages consumption-led growth patterns that fuel expansionary cycles within an economy.  In conclusion: while global GDP is projected to improve this year over last year's performance, it is important not to overlook the fact that growth rates remain below the historical average. Unlocking untapped opportunities for higher economic performance across various countries requires a concerted effort from policymakers globally.  By embracing necessary structural reforms tailored specifically for each nation's unique circumstances while promoting inclusive economic policies will be essential in harnessing an economy's true potential for sustainable long-term prosperity.

"Switzerland to Launch Innovative Solutions in Response to Dwindling Population  The current population trends in Swiss cantons have raised concerns among economists and policy-makers as the nation faces a decline in population growth. According to recent data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, the percentage of the total population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from today's figure of 15.4% to a staggering 24.3% by 2030. At the same time, the percentage of people under 20 years old is expected to drop from 23.1% to just 19.3%.  These demographic changes spell trouble for Switzerland's future as they lead to a shrinking labor force and an increased burden on public services, particularly healthcare and social security systems. The ratio of active workers supporting retirees will fall from its current ratio of 4:1 down to approximately 2.3:1.  In response to these challenges, Switzerland is set on launching innovative solutions that address both political and economic headaches that may arise due to this shrinking population conundrum.  One such solution gaining traction is an incentivized immigration program targeting highly skilled professionals from around the globe who could work in vital industries where labor shortages are becoming apparent as retirement rates increase drastically within Switzerland's aging workforce.  Experts believe that by attracting talented individuals worldwide through competitive immigration policies, Switzerland can address this imbalance while maintaining its economic growth potential well into the future.  ""Switzerland has always been a hub for talent,"" says Professor Annika Müller from Zurich University Economics Department, ""but it needs an injection of new blood not only for economic reasons but also for cultural diversity.""  To further counteract declining birth rates within its own borders, Switzerland intends on implementing several supportive measures aimed at helping young families thrive financially while ensuring equal opportunities for women's career advancement.  ""Childcare affordability remains one significant challenge,"" notes Sarah Fischer, head economist at Credit Suisse Research Institute. ""We need to develop policies that make balancing work and family life more achievable for both parents, reducing the economic burden and encouraging couples to have children.""  Additionally, investments in education and training programs will be instrumental in equipping the future workforce with essential skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing labor market. Emphasizing lifelong learning opportunities will provide workers with the necessary tools to remain professionally relevant even as job requirements shift over time.  To combat increased healthcare costs associated with an aging population, Switzerland has turned its focus toward digital health solutions and advancements in medical technologies. The country aims to leverage its reputation for cutting-edge precision engineering by fostering partnerships between academic institutions, private enterprises, and healthcare providers.  ""We have a unique opportunity here,"" says Dr. Markus Keller, Director of Population Health at ETH Zurich. ""By embracing technology-driven approaches such as remote patient monitoring or AI-powered diagnostics, we can not only increase efficiency within our healthcare system but also improve the quality of care provided.""  While these measures indicate Switzerland's proactive response towards demographic challenges ahead, they are not without obstacles—a delicate balance must be struck between attracting skilled immigrants and preserving Swiss cultural identity while ensuring equitable treatment of all residents.  With 7.2 million inhabitants currently calling Switzerland home – nearly one million more than two decades ago – the country will soon embark on this transformational journey that seeks both economic growth and societal well-being amidst shifting demographic landscapes.  As Switzerland prepares itself for a future with an aging society at its core, innovative solutions coupled with sustainable policies demonstrate that it is ready to tackle this challenge head-on; leveraging both local talent and international cooperation is critical in securing continued prosperity for generations to come.

"The Value of Financial Markets: Promising Outlook for Sustainable Investments  Written by Arun Ratra, Senior Investment Analyst at Credit Suisse  In the fast-paced world of financial markets, the value of an asset is often a point of contention. Investors and analysts continuously grapple with determining the true worth of stocks, bonds, and other instruments. As we delve deeper into this subject, it becomes apparent that value is not only determined by what investors are willing to pay but also by various objective calculations.  One area that highlights this complex interplay between perception and objective valuation is sustainable investments. These investments focus on companies and initiatives that prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. For years, critics have argued that such investments may generate less financial returns compared to traditional ventures. However, a groundbreaking study conducted by industry experts challenges this notion.  The study analyzes the performance of sustainable investments in comparison to their conventional counterparts over a 10-year period. Astonishingly enough, it reveals that such ethical investments consistently outperformed traditional ones across multiple sectors. This finding shatters preconceived notions about sustainable investing being solely motivated by altruism.  When evaluating stock values within sustainable portfolios using conventional valuation models based on future earnings potential or cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate per risk taken (discounted cash flow analysis), these assets shine even more brightly in terms of their actual worthiness for investment.  One striking example showcased in the study relates to renewable energy companies. Historically seen as risky due to high initial capital requirements coupled with uncertain government incentives and regulations, renewable energy stocks have surged ahead impressively in recent years as they increasingly become competitive with conventional fossil fuel-based assets.  This newfound success can be attributed partly to advances in technology making renewable energy sources easier to harness than ever before; solar panels are now cheaper than ever while wind turbines continue improving efficiency year after year. Consequently, investors are recognizing both their positive environmental impact and sound financial potential, driving up their value.  It is fascinating to witness how societal shifts are impacting the perception of value within financial markets. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, they increasingly demand products and services that align with their ethical values. This change in consumer behavior translates into a direct impact on company revenues and profitability. And as these companies grow in value, investors flock to take part in this sustainable investment wave.  This study serves as a wake-up call for market participants who have overlooked the genuine worth of sustainable investments due to ingrained biases. It demonstrates that there is immense potential for generating attractive returns while simultaneously making a positive impact on our planet.  In light of these findings, financial institutions like Credit Suisse have redoubled their commitment to sustainable investing by offering dedicated funds and advisory services tailored to clients interested in both profit and purpose. By encouraging investors to include ESG-based assets within their portfolios, we can foster long-term economic growth while supporting environmental conservation and social progress.  Certainly, challenges remain as we seek to unlock the full potential of sustainable investments. Standardization of ESG reporting frameworks across regions continues to evolve slowly but surely, providing investors with better transparency when assessing green initiatives' credibility. Additionally, collaborative efforts between governments, regulators, corporations, and investors are vital towards sustaining this positive trend.  As we navigate an increasingly complex global landscape filled with economic uncertainties and mounting environmental concerns such as climate change or rising income inequality - it becomes evident that prioritizing sustainability should be at the forefront of any forward-thinking investment strategy.  Investors worldwide must recognize the immense value hidden behind ethical investments; opportunities lie not only in monetary gains but also in building a future where social responsibility takes precedence over short-term profits.

"Africa's Economic Renaissance gathering pace with Sustained Growth  Sir John Major: I first visited Africa in late 1965 during the Biafran War. I went there as a young banker working for the then Standard Bank of West Africa. I was fortunate enough to be stationed at Jos in Northern Nigeria. I fell in love with Africa then. I don't think I have ever seen such enormous skies and open space anywhere else in the world. I thought it was absolutely idyllic and had a very unique feel that has attracted me ever since. Africa has limitless potential, providing it is given the opportunity to flourish.  In recent years, this forgotten continent has been quietly making remarkable strides towards an economic renaissance. As investors increasingly awaken to its vast potential, African nations are enjoying sustained growth across various sectors, propelling them onto the global stage.  From agriculture to technology, infrastructure development to manufacturing, African economies are diversifying at an astonishing rate. The continent's growing middle class has fueled consumer demand and foreign direct investment is pouring in like never before.  One particular success story comes from Kenya – often referred to as ""Silicon Savannah"" – which is rapidly emerging as a global technology hub right at the heart of East Africa's tech revolution.  Thanks to substantial investments made by local entrepreneurs and international tech giants alike, Kenya has become a breeding ground for innovation and startups. The country now boasts thriving mobile money platforms like M-Pesa – revolutionizing digital finance not only within Kenya but across several African nations as well.  Similarly, Ghana is experiencing significant advancements within its cocoa industry through value addition initiatives that transform raw cocoa beans into finished products domestically rather than merely exporting them for further processing overseas.  The diversification doesn't stop there; Rwanda is positioning itself as an attractive destination for manufacturing investments by offering competitive incentives such as tax breaks and streamlined bureaucracy processes. This approach significantly boosts job creation while driving economic growth simultaneously.  Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, has witnessed a remarkable turnaround in recent years with the agricultural sector leading the growth charge. The government's focus on improving rural infrastructure and implementing innovative policies to modernize farming practices is contributing to increased productivity and food security.  South Africa, long considered the economic powerhouse of the continent, is also undergoing transformative changes. Expanding its renewable energy capacity has not only attracted substantial foreign investment but also helped reduce carbon emissions significantly.  While these examples represent just a fraction of the tremendous progress being made across Africa, it is crucial to acknowledge that several challenges remain. Infrastructure gaps, political instability in some regions, and lingering effects of corruption hinder progress across various sectors.  However, amidst these obstacles lie countless opportunities for investors willing to navigate these complexities and support sustainable development initiatives in African nations. Addressing these challenges head-on will require partnerships between governments, private enterprises, and international organizations for optimal outcomes.  Sir John Major once said that Africa could become ""the new Asia"" if given adequate opportunities for growth. Today we are witnessing this prophecy unfold as African countries rise to meet their vast potential on the global stage.  As economists project continued positive growth trajectories for many African economies over the coming decades, it becomes increasingly clear that this forgotten continent will no longer be overlooked by investors seeking high returns coupled with a positive impact on society.  Africa's economic renaissance is underway – an exciting journey worth observing as it unfolds before our eyes. This burgeoning success story serves as a reminder that limitless potential exists when we give every corner of our world an equal chance to prosper.",create
"A New Wave of Young Musical Prodigies: Identifying Talent at an Early Age  In a world where greatness is often attributed to natural talent, a new wave of young musical prodigies is challenging this notion. From astonishingly gifted violinists to extraordinary piano virtuosos, these young talents are captivating audiences around the globe with their undeniable genius.  The recognition of such prodigious talent has always been part and parcel of the artistic realm. Maestro Lorin Maazel himself once remarked that musicians, like athletes and mathematicians, display their extraordinary abilities early on in life. However, while many gifted artists follow a similar trajectory by honing their skills quietly behind closed doors until later in life, few showcase their talent as publicly and prominently as the young phenoms we are witnessing now.  Take for instance fourteen-year-old Elena Petrova from Russia, whose breathtaking performances have catapulted her into the limelight recently. Her flawless technique and emotive renditions have earned her comparisons to legends like Itzhak Perlman and Anne-Sophie Mutter - accolades usually reserved for seasoned professionals with decades of experience.  Petrova's rise to prominence began when she won first prize at numerous prestigious international music competitions before even reaching her teens. She attributes her success to countless hours spent practicing diligently under the guidance of esteemed mentors who recognized her potential at an early age. Such youthful achievements are not limited to solo performers either – orchestras around the world have begun welcoming teens into their ranks.  In line with this growing trend, The Swiss Symphony Orchestra made headlines last month when they appointed seventeen-year-old Sebastian Müller as its principal conductor – making him one of the youngest leaders in modern orchestral history. Müller's artistry on the podium is nothing short of remarkable; his ability to captivate both musicians and audiences alike demonstrates an innate understanding beyond his years.  It begs the question: how do these young talents emerge? Credit Suisse Bulletin interviewed renowned child prodigy expert Dr. Antonia Fischer, who shed some light on the matter. According to Dr. Fischer, exceptional talent often manifests as early as three or four years old but goes unnoticed or unacknowledged by most parents and teachers. She emphasizes the importance of nurturing these abilities from a young age through rigorous training and exposure to different musical styles.  One cannot mention young prodigies in the music world without discussing eight-year-old Isabella Chen, a piano prodigy born to Chinese immigrants in New York City. Chen's precocious talent garnered significant attention after she performed at Carnegie Hall last year - an extraordinary feat for someone so young.  Experts have long debated whether innate talent is more crucial than hard work when it comes to achieving greatness. Renowned neurologist Dr. Marianne Schneider argues that while natural ability is undoubtedly essential, hard work and dedication are equally vital components of success in any field - especially music.  The emergence of these incredibly gifted individuals challenges traditional notions about age and achievement, pushing boundaries and inspiring younger generations to explore their own hidden talents early on in life. As society continues to recognize the prowess exhibited by these young musical geniuses, it falls upon us to support them in their journeys towards becoming tomorrow's maestros.  With institutions like Credit Suisse investing resources into identifying and nurturing youthful promise through sponsorship programs and scholarships for talented youngsters around the world, we can expect this unique trend of early artistic prowess only to amplify further in the years ahead.  As Lorin Maazel aptly mentioned before his passing: ""You cannot become a chess master unless you have the genius for it."" The same could be said for these extraordinary emerging artists who possess an innate brilliance that sets them apart from their peers – destined for greatness from an early age.  In this evolving landscape where boundaries are being redefined by gifted youth breaking barriers deemed insurmountable until now, we must applaud and support these budding talents for their unwavering dedication and the exceptional beauty they bring to the world through their art.",create
"Creating 1,000 New IT Apprenticeships to Bridge the Skills Gap in Switzerland  Switzerland, known for its innovation and technological advancements, is facing a pressing challenge: a shortage of qualified IT specialists. Recent surveys conducted by ICTswitzerland reveal that there are not enough skilled professionals in the country to fill vital positions within the business and administration fields. To address this shortfall, a groundbreaking initiative has been launched aimed at creating 1,000 new IT apprenticeships.  Over the past few years, Switzerland has witnessed a troubling decline in the number of graduates from advanced training programs. The statistics are alarming - between 2004 and 2008 alone, there was an almost 50% drop in individuals obtaining specialist certificates and diplomas in IT. As a result, ICTswitzerland estimates that the nation requires between 5,000 and 6,000 IT specialists annually who possess professional or college-level training.  Recognizing the urgent need to bridge this skills gap and foster greater opportunities for young professionals seeking careers in technology-related fields, forward-thinking organizations have championed this ambitious apprenticeship program. The proposal outlines plans to create comprehensive training pathways that will equip apprentices with relevant skills necessary for flourishing within Switzerland's dynamic tech industry.  ""We cannot afford to overlook our nation's potential talent pool,"" asserts Markus Kruegerhanselmannschaften III., CEO of ICTswitzerland. ""By investing in education and providing real-world experiences through these apprenticeships—with hands-on guidance from accomplished mentors—we can cultivate young professionals who will help drive our economy forward.""  This transformative initiative boasts cross-sector collaboration involving prominent players from both public institutions and private corporations alike. Credit Suisse stands as one of the principal sponsors supporting this endeavor.  Tiffany Leuenberger-Eggerhausenbruggenrussell V., Chief Human Resources Officer at Credit Suisse Group AG stresses their commitment to addressing Switzerland's critical skills gap: ""As a leading financial institution, we recognize the significance of a robust IT workforce for both our organization and the broader Swiss economy. By partnering with education providers and offering these apprenticeships, we aim to nurture a new generation of talent that will contribute to our nation's long-term success.""  The proposed training framework encompasses a blend of theoretical coursework and practical hands-on experience. Apprentices will have opportunities to work alongside experienced professionals across various IT disciplines, such as software engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, and infrastructure management. Through immersive learning experiences in real-world settings, they will acquire knowledge and skills necessary for the demands of today's ever-evolving technological landscape.  To ensure widespread access to these apprenticeships while encouraging diversity within the field, special emphasis is being placed on attracting underrepresented groups in technology-related professions – including women. Research has repeatedly shown that diverse teams foster innovation and lead to better business outcomes.  ""This initiative aims not only to address the skills gap but also pave the way for a more inclusive future,"" states Andrea Fischer-Kobellpfeiffermannsmauer IV., Minister of Education at the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education & Research.  The launch date for this monumental program is slated for early next year. Interested candidates can apply through dedicated portals established by participating organizations where requirements and selection criteria are outlined comprehensively. Successful applicants will embark on a transformative journey towards elevating their professional trajectories within Switzerland's vibrant tech ecosystem.  With public-private partnerships at its core, this collaborative effort holds immense promise in shaping Switzerland's IT landscape positively - bolstering its competitiveness globally while simultaneously providing lucrative employment opportunities domestically. The 1,000 new IT apprenticeships act as an investment not just in young talent but also lay foundations for sustainable economic growth fueled by Swiss ingenuity and expertise. ",create
"threshold since 2007 . Looking in more detail at the global pattern , the story this year is a tale of two countries . The United States posted a fifth successive year of rises in personal wealth . Fuelled by a recovery in house prices and a bull equity market which drove the Dow Jones to new highs , the United States added 8.1 trillion US dollars to the global wealth stock , increasing wealth ownership by 12.7 percent to 72.1 trillion US dollars . This is 20 percent more than the pre-crisis high in 2006 and 54 percent above the recent low in 2008 . Aggressive monetary policy by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) spurred an even greater rise in equity prices - up 52 percent in the year to mid-2013 . But equities in Japan are very low by international standards , accounting for less than 10 percent of household financial wealth , and the same aggressive BOJ policies drove the yen-USD exchange rate down by 22 percent . As a consequence , total household wealth in Japan has fallen by 5.8 trillion US dollars this year , equivalent to 20 percent of Japanese net worth . Japan suffered very little during the global financial crisis - in fact personal wealth grew by 21 percent between 2007 and 2008 . However , in marked contrast to recent performance by the United States , total wealth is now just 1 percent above the 2008 level . In most other parts of the world , the economic environment has been generally favorable to wealth acquisition . The extent to which the United States and Japan dominate the world picture this year is illustrated by the figure , which shows the countries with the largest total wealth gains and losses . China ( 1.4 trillion US dollars ) , Germany ( 1.2 trillion US dollars ) and France ( 1.1 trillion US dollars ) are the only other countries where the change in wealth exceeded 1 trillion US dollars . Total wealth changed in a further eight countries by more than 200 billion US dollars ( all gains ) : Italy , the United Kingdom , Spain , Mexico , Sweden , India , Korea and Canada . The equity price increase and the slightly favorable euro-dollar movement enabled the Eurozone countries to recover more than half of the very large wealth loss experienced 12 months earlier . The United Kingdom , India and Switzerland also managed to recover a significant portion of recent losses . As already noted , global household wealth equates to 51,600 US dollars per adult , a new all-time high for average net worth . This average global value masks considerable variation across countries and regions , as is evident in the figure . The richest nations , with wealth per adult over 100,000 US dollars , are found in North America , Western Europe , and among the rich Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern countries . They are headed by Switzerland , which in 2011 became the first country in which average wealth exceeded 500,000 US dollars . It dropped below this mark in 2012 , but this year equity price rises resulted in a new peak value of 513,000 US dollars per adult . Australia ( 403,000 US dollars ) , Norway ( 380,000 US dollars ) and Luxembourg ( 315,000 US dollars ) all experienced an increase in wealth per adult and retain their respective second , third and fourth places from 2012 . The United States , Sweden , France , Singapore , Belgium and Denmark are close behind , with average wealth per adult in the 250,000 to 300,000 US dollar range . A year ago , Japan moved up to fourth place in the table , but it has now been demoted and no longer ranks among the top ten countries . To determine how global wealth is distributed across households and individuals - rather than regions or countries - we combine our data on the level of household wealth across countries with information on the pattern of wealth distribution within countries . Our estimates for mid-2013 indicate that once debts have been subtracted , an adult requires just 4,000 US dollars in assets to be in the wealthiest half of world citizens . However , a person needs at least 75,000 US dollars to be a member of the top 10 percent of global wealth holders , and 753,000 US dollars to belong to the top 1 percent . Taken together , the bottom half of the global population own less than 1 percent of total wealth . In sharp contrast , the richest 10 percent hold 86 percent of the world 's wealth , and the top 1 percent alone account for 46 percent of global assets . Further information on the pattern of total wealth ownership across regions and countries during the year to mid-2013 can be found in the full publication : Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2013 .",human
"bore the brunt of higher savings pressure on public budgets , among other things . For the construction industry , however , 2014 was very lively thanks to continued low interest rates and extensive planning activities in the preceding years . Unlike the domestically focused service industries , the export industry picked up the pace , though to a lesser extent than expected and not across the board . 2015 began with a monetary policy shakeup . The franc appreciated greatly after the CHF / EUR exchange rate floor was lifted , thereby making Swiss products and services immediately more expensive versus their foreign counterparts . The export industry suddenly lost its ability to compete on price , and some companies suffered major book losses . However , the stronger franc will likely leave its mark on the domestic economy as well . Thus , for 2015 we expect the general economy will have much lower growth than in 2014 , and have revised our GDP growth forecast for Switzerland from 1.6 percent to 0.8 percent . However , with an average exchange rate to the euro of just over 1.00 , we do not expect a recession . Thus , the strong franc is likely to be the dominating , but not exclusive , topic for many industries this year . The exchange rate floor was lifted against the background of stagnant global economic recovery and a tailing-off in domestic momentum . The vote in favor of the mass immigration initiative in February 2014 still hangs like the Sword of Damocles over the bilateral agreements with the EU , which are critical for the economy , and the geopolitical risks still loom large at the start of 2015 . The new monetary policy 's reality is overshadowing other uncertainties and developments , however . Of Switzerland 's main industries , hospitality is likely to be the most affected by recent events . Switzerland as a vacation destination has become much pricier now , which will probably mean fewer hotel visits by foreign guests . Moreover , Swiss travelers will have more incentive to spend their vacations in another country . Because the cost basis is almost exclusively in francs , in part because wages account for a large portion of production costs , the industry has little chance to trim expenses . 2015 is likely to be a difficult year for most export sectors as well . The strong franc affects nearly all industries , though in different ways . The extent of the impact on an industry depends not only on export orientation but also on the margin level , the volume of products that are billed in foreign currencies , the percentage of costs that originate in Switzerland , and the customers ' price sensitivity . The mechanical and electrical engineering industry , which is strongly export-focused , is expected to react especially sensitively ; its growth track was a rocky one even before the franc appreciated again . Sales in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry are not likely to grow much year-on-year either , due to the exchange-rate effect , and the same applies to watch manufacturers . However , manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and watches should withstand the situation better than companies in other industrial sectors , because they can better absorb the appreciation by raising their margins . Given the exchange rate situation , the processing industry looks set to cut jobs in 2015 . The strong franc is likely to be a predominant issue for retailers as well in 2015 . We expect that shopping tourism , which was already at a high level , will be boosted and thus we believe that retail sales this year will be lower than in 2014 . This , in turn , will likely impede employment in the industry . Apart from the banks , the strong franc should have a comparatively low impact on most other service industries this year . We expect that , following some delay , the stronger franc will mean lower overall economic demand for workers . Combined with lower immigration , this will stunt demand for telecommunications and hospital services , for instance . However , we do not expect this effect to be noticeable before 2016 . Service providers and IT companies will see lower growth in sales and employment this year than in 2014 , because their finance and industrial customers ' consulting and IT budgets will be tight under the strong franc . However , both industries will still benefit from key trends such as increasing regulation , especially in the financial sector , and from rapid technological progress , which will force companies to make investments in productivity-boosting IT solutions . Individual sectors are currently subject not only to economic and exchange-rate related fluctuations , but also to structural factors and trends that have a medium and long-term impact . In this context , each year we create a medium-term opportunity-risk profile of the main Swiss sectors . One of the leading multi-sector trends included in this opportunity-risk profile is demographic change . Coupled with advances in medical technology , which are continually providing new diagnostic and treatment options , the aging population of the industrialized nations means a constant increase in demand for healthcare , nursing care , and support services , along with products from the pharmaceuticals and medical technology industries . Thus , these industries lead the pack in the opportunity-risk profile . Another sector with an above-average opportunity-risk profile is IT . The demand for IT services is driven by technological progress and the ongoing digitalization of the economy and society . The adaption processes of companies in relation to technological progress mean bigger order books for the IT and consulting industries . In this area , the rising number and complexity of regulations , along with stricter compliance requirements , are boosting demand .",human
"We expect these trends to continue . Over the next 12 months , it is likely that the relative outperformance of emerging market consumption will accelerate for four key reasons : ( 1 ) as implied by the relative momentum in lead indicators , ( 2 ) real wages and income growth in the emerging economies continue to top those in developed markets , ( 3 ) China is focused on policies aimed at promoting greater domestic consumption , and ( 4 ) ageing and over-leveraged developed markets continue to suffer a downward adjustment to household consumption . The overall survey results endorse this positive macro view with consumers ' optimistic about the immediate outlook continuing to improve . 37 percent of respondents see an improvement in their financial position in the next six months versus 9 percent seeing a deterioration , a net 3 percent improvement on last year . However , the aggregate macro data disguise a picture that is far from uniform within and between the emerging economies . Our survey shines a spotlight on this . Of the eight countries included in the Consumer Survey , optimism on the financial outlook is strongest in Brazil , China , Indonesia and Saudi Arabia . In Brazil , 66 percent of respondents to the survey said they expected an improvement in their personal finances over the next six months . The proportion of consumers in China , Indonesia and Saudi Arabia who expected an improvement in their personal finances over the next six months came to 44 percent , 42 percent and 33 percent , respectively . At the other end of the scale , the greatest degree of pessimism in financial prospects was recorded in South Africa , Russia and Turkey . Specifically , our survey results showed that nearly as many South Africans ( 22 percent ) predicted a worse financial position as those who expected some improvement ( 28 percent ) over the next six months . In a much milder form , we do recall our 2010 survey with regards to Egypt . Our survey results then showed that 38 percent of Egyptians expected a deterioration in their financial outlook compared with 12 percent who expected an improvement . While there is a danger in unduly striking parallels , we do remember the social unrest that subsequently became apparent in Egypt in spring 2011 . We now of course have witnessed the widespread strikes that have affected South Africa over the course of H2 2012 . When we compare the aggregate results in our latest survey with last year 's survey , we find that consumers , on average , are more optimistic now . In Brazil , the balance of consumers expecting better rather than worse financial prospects over the next six months has increased from 53 percent in 2011 to 63 percent in 2012 , which is the highest reading for three years . In China , the same statistic has picked up from 31 percent to 39 percent in 2012 . Indonesia has continued to see strong positive momentum in consumer confidence : a net 40 percent now expect better financial conditions in the months ahead . The mood has continued to deteriorate in India and Russia . Only 28 percent of our Indian sample expect some improvement in financial conditions in the next six months compared with 36 percent in 2011 and 40 percent in 2010 . Last year , we found that the momentum in consumer optimism was closely aligned with the weight of food in the consumption basket as food prices had risen to relatively high levels . This year , some respite in ( trailing ) food inflation has meant less drag on consumer sentiment and has left economic growth and wage expectations as the main determinants of the outlook . Our survey data show that nominal wage expectations are strongest in Brazil , closely followed by Indonesia ( which showed a significant improvement over the previous year ) and then Saudi Arabia . Wage expectations remain relatively depressed in Turkey , Russia and South Africa . The South African data is interesting : despite a substantial increase in nominal wages on the back of the recent labor unrest , a considerable percentage of the lower income groups expect a significant decline in household income possibly in response to rising unemployment levels ( at least within the formal sectors ) that now look inevitable given rising labor cost pressures driven by tough wage negotiations and strong growth in minimum wages . The other common feature that can be observed from our survey data is the age composition of the income brackets . The key takeaway is that , in many markets , the youngest end of the working-age population has achieved the highest income levels . China is a case in point . The average 18-29 year olds in our most recent survey have achieved average monthly incomes of around 9100 Chinese renminbi , which is 7 percent above those of the 46-55 year olds and 15 percent above the 56-65 age group . This is a feature that was also common to Indonesia , Russia and Turkey . In Brazil and India , the difference in earnings between the age groups was relatively flat . In South Africa 's case , the youngest group within the working age population earned substantially more than the oldest age group , but , rather than reflecting high earnings at the young end , this appears to be a reflection of very poor earnings for the older age groups . Arguably , very high unemployment rates in South Africa ( 25.5 percent according to the latest data from STATS SA ) mean that the effective average working life is much shorter than the legal limit . Of course , we recognize that these results could be influenced by the sample of respondents to our survey rather than being a reflection of the wider consumer base . However , with the help of nationally available demographic statistics , we have endeavored to ensure that the sample polled was an appropriate representation of average income brackets , age groups and geographical location . The rationale for the greater affluence of the younger age groups comes down to three key factors : ( a ) education - our survey data also show that the younger age groups have relatively higher educational attainment ; ( b ) urban-rural migration - the younger age groups are much more willing and likely to have migrated toward the higher paid jobs in the urban centers ; and ( c ) technology has also played a role - many of the higher paid jobs have encompassed a greater degree of automation and/ or technological input , which has favored the younger age groups on average . There are important implications of the age distribution of income growth for consumer spending patterns . Generally , we find and expect that the younger age earners are much more likely to spend incremental income on technology and branded consumer goods and are less likely to focus on insurance policies or healthcare expenditure . Of course , over the long term , as these more affluent consumers mature , spending patterns are likely to shift more strongly toward the likes of healthcare .",human
"used , if at all , to replace previous ECB loans . Moreover , commercial banks in Northern Europe have little interest in the program because they can now borrow almost as cheaply in the market . Conversely , the weakness in demand for corporate credit in the Eurozone "" periphery "" limits these countries ' banks ' need for the ECB loans . The details of the ECB program are fairly complex because of the complicated structure of the Eurozone 's system of central banks and because political compromises had to be made , but overall the quantitative easing ( QE ) program looks like a potentially powerful one to us . Its key features are : Starting in March 2015 , the ECB intends to buy EUR 60 bn of assets per month until at least September 2016 . This would amount to approximately EUR 1140 bn for the total program , slightly above expectations . We estimate that about EUR 40 bn per month could flow into sovereign bonds , which approximates to total sovereign bond purchases of about EUR 760 bn , also above market expectations ; the latter had ranged between EUR 500 bn and 700 bn . The intended length of the program is also somewhat greater than expected . Moreover , the ECB indicated that QE could be extended beyond 2016 if it is necessary to bring inflation back on track toward the 2 percent targetPurchases across markets will be allocated according to the capital shares which the national central banks hold in the ECB ( capital key ) . This means that the Bundesbank , for instance , will buy a larger amount of bonds than the Banca d'Italia . Purchases will be undertaken by the national central banks , which are members of the Eurosystem.Generally , purchases will be limited to 25 percent of the outstanding debt of a particular issuance and 33 percent of particular issuer . Purchases will be made along a maturity range of 2-30 years.Apart from sovereign bonds , the national central banks can also buy bonds from supranational institutions or agencies . While this is less important , it still amounts to 12 percent of the additional purchases.There had been some discussion regarding the creditor status of the ECB relative to other holders of government bonds . The ECB has confirmed , however , that it will not have senior status . This is important because it prevents the credit quality of debt held by private investors from worsening as the ECB accumulates bonds.As expected , Greek bonds are excluded for the time being from the QE program because their credit quality is insufficient . Countries under an adjustment program will have to fulfill specific criteria.Apart from the purchase program , the ECB also reduced the interest rate charged on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations ( TLTRO ) by 10 basis points , effectively setting it equal to the main refinancing rate of 0.05 percent . The only feature of the QE program which had raised discussions regarding its robustness over the past week is the issue of so-called risk-sharing . Germany , in particular , had insisted that national central banks need to bear the risk of potential losses on their respective government 's bonds . The argument was that QE would otherwise breach the "" no-bailout "" clause . In reality , we do not think , however , that this feature seriously undermines the effectiveness of QE , as there are other mechanisms which reduce the risk of government default . First , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) can act as backstop to governments and banks under a potential support program ; second , the ECB could , in principle , support individual governments , since the European Court of Justice recently indicated conditional support programs ( OMT ) as legal ; third , the TARGET2 system , which effectively allows central banks in EMU member states to borrow to an almost unlimited extent from each other , is a further key backstop . Various observers have argued that QE would not work in the Eurozone , in contrast to the USA or UK . We disagree . First , although bond yields in the Eurozone periphery have declined markedly , we think they could decline even further , and thereby lower overall borrowing costs . Second , by buying government bonds from banks and other investors , the latter should be enticed to invest elsewhere ( i.e. bank lending should also be enhanced ) . Third , bond purchases will not only support bond prices , but also translate into increases in other asset prices . This should , for example , make it more attractive for companies to raise equity capital , and it implies positive wealth effects for households . Real estate prices will likely also be supported . Finally , QE , which will expand the ECB 's balance sheet while other central banks , notably the Fed and the Bank of England , have halted their asset purchases , should weaken the euro , and thereby stimulate the competitiveness of Eurozone companies . Possibly of greatest importance , in our view , could be the effect on the confidence of European businesses and consumers . The launch of the QE program is a powerful signal that the Eurozone will indeed stay intact and that policymakers are finally doing "" what is needed "" to boost growth . Overall , we think QE adds another piece of the puzzle to an improving policy framework in the Eurozone . Fiscal consolidation has come a long way , even if actual deficits are still high due to the weak cyclical situation . This will allow governments to ease off further from austerity measures . Second , the European Banking Union has been launched , which reduces financial risks and may improve financial market integration . Efforts to move to a Capital Markets Union may gather steam as well ; QE should , in any case , reduce the perceived risks of cross-border investment . Finally , structural reforms continue to be implemented in all the Eurozone economies , including Italy and France , albeit hesitantly . Overall , this strengthens our view that the Eurozone will gradually emerge from stagnation , and that we may even see upside economic surprises . While our asset class experts will provide more details on the financial market and investment strategy implications of QE , we believe that it has essentially three impacts : first , QE will generally keep bond yields low for long , and to the extent that QE lowers default risks in the Eurozone , spreads of peripheral bonds should also stay tight . While overall expected returns are very low in most bond markets , the risk of major setbacks is therefore limited . That said , like in the case of the USA , our strategists expect longer-dated bonds , especially in Germany , to weaken somewhat as QE is actually launched ( "" buy the rumor , sell the fact "" ) . Second , QE should further weaken the EUR against other major currencies . Third , Eurozone equities should be supported by better growth and thus earnings prospects , low interest rates and a weaker EUR . On a sectoral basis , banks should benefit from QE as better domestic growth stimulates lending and reduces loan losses . Further beneficiaries are European exporters which will profit from a weaker EUR . Prime examples include the German automobile industry , which produces high-end cars exclusively in Germany and exports them all over the world . For Switzerland , QE is a mixed blessing . While the expected improvement in economic activity should be supportive , the risk is that the CHF stays very strong against the EUR or even appreciates further , at least temporarily . This would weaken exports and slow the economy . Finally , the implication of continued CHF strength is that negative inflation will persist in Switzerland . For the Swiss National Bank , this may well imply that it needs to intervene more heavily than expected in the foreign exchange markets to prevent excessive CHF appreciation ( in contrast to what was hoped for as the lower EUR bound was abandoned ) , or that interest rates will need to be lowered even further .",human
"will improve more rapidly than expected next year ? I think the United States will recover a good deal more swiftly than many people imagine . They have their problems , they have a huge debt position , but the trajectory of bringing debt down is very attractive now . They 're becoming more and more self-sufficient in energy , which will add to internal confidence , and improved spirits . So , I suspect that the United States will grow quite rapidly . Furthermore , I think the United Kingdom might outperform people 's current expectations . Traditionally , they have swung further and faster into recession , or further and faster into growth , than most forecasts have indicated . I think that may happen again . China , at a growth rate of 7.5 percent , will still be very significant . So , I think some countries will grow faster than anticipated . However , we 're not looking at a boom scenario . We 're looking at a growing recovery . And I think growing steadily may be healthier in the medium term , than a very rapid and sharp return , artificially stimulated . I think that is going to take some years . With any fruits of growth , there 's partly dealing with the debt problem , which is expensive and diminishes the money available for growth , and there 's partly the expense of growth-related policies . The recent financial crisis , and the recession that followed it , has been almost unprecedented in scope . We have n't had anything quite like this to deal with for a very , very long time . And of course , policy has been cautious . It 's going to be quite some time before we return to the healthy state of the world economy , to which we are now heading . There are always uncertainties in the world . Another unexpected and large banking collapse , for example , would clearly have a very significant effect . If a problem arises and there 's a dash to lower the exchange rates of currencies among many countries , that could conceivably create a currency problem . There 's also always the familiar problem of whether there will be trouble in one part of the world or another - most obviously , in the Middle East . That could create problems . But , there 's nothing one can foresee now that looks substantial , or as though it could derail what is a steady recovery . I think it is healthy that China are looking at a more sustainable growth pattern at the present time and for the future . Also , for a raft of different reasons , China have decided to expand domestic demand within the country , with wage increases averaging about 13 percent a year , presumably for the next few years . That will create both a bigger internal market within China , and a much bigger market for the rest of the world to aim at . I think that is a very benevolent development for the world economy . In terms of military matters , yes , I think we are in a safer place . It 's fashionable these days to be very gloomy . You can be very wise if you 're gloomy . But some very optimistic things are emerging . One of them is , as the global economy intertwines , as we become more and more dependent upon one another , as America , China , and the European Union begin to have increasingly common interests in what happens around the world , the chance of conflict is much less than it was . The relationship , for example , between the two biggest powers , America and China , is infinitely better today than was the relationship between the two dominant powers , America and the Soviet Union , 30 years ago . We may have small wars , we have terrorism , we may have economic problems . We will have uncertainties . But we do n't have that risk that existed for so long , of a serious intercontinental conflict . That , I think , is becoming less likely every single year . And I think that is a very attractive development side effect of the way the world economy has made us more dependent upon one another .",human
"They 're individuals who are living their lives for music , with music , and because of music . I do n't think people in normal lines of work have anything comparable . We might have great and interesting jobs , but that level of commitment is something else . You want them all to succeed , and it 's tough that there can be only one winner . "" Credit Suisse , the Vienna Philharmonic , the Geslleschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien , and the Lucerne Festival established the award back in 2000 with the shared intent of supporting young talent and investing in a collective cultural future at a significant international level . It is not a competition in the conventional sense . Its five jury members nominate one candidate each ; the decision-making process includes an hour-long recital covering a broad range of musical epochs and an interview , and the jury reaches its verdict through a process of open discussion . For the 2012 award , the jury included Prof . Dr . Dieter Flury of the Vienna Philharmonic , Dr Peter Hagmann , critic for the Neue Züricher Zeitung , and the American Academy 's Pamela Rosenberg , former Artistic Director of the Berlin Philharmonic , alongside Haefliger . The final decision in favour of Frang was unanimous . "" She has a range of colours in her playing which really surprised us in someone so young , "" said Rosenberg . "" She 's incredibly mature for her age , and has both expressive power and stylistic assurance . She also has an immense honesty in performance - it really comes from an inner connection to the music . "" Something of that directness emerges in conversation with Frang . Her mane of chestnut hair remains determinedly tousled even in publicity photographs , and her eyes widen with ingenuous astonishment at the suggestion that for a young woman who has already recorded her third disc for the EMI label and performed at many of the world 's leading Festivals , with many great conductors , and on many important concert stages , yet another award might not be such a big deal . "" Oh ! "" she breathes , genuinely amazed . "" Of course it is ! The big circus that comes with awards and scholarships and prizes is one thing . But an engagement like this is something else altogether . That 's what makes it special - at THIS Festival , with THIS orchestra , with a conductor who has been my hero for years - it feels like paradise ! "" Michael Haefliger Frang numbers several previous recipients of the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award amongst her circle of friends , and she has given a recital as part of the Lucerne Festival 's "" Young "" series . As a student of Kolja Blacher , Concertmaster of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra , she was a regular visitor - and fan - of the Lucerne Festival . A concert there with the prestigious Vienna Philharmonic - not an orchestra which otherwise allots much programming space in its calendar to lesser-known young soloists - is a dream come true . "" I grew up with the Vienna Philharmonic 's recordings , "" says Frang . "" I watch their New Year 's concert every year . I know these faces already , and they do n't have a clue about me . So it 's a fantastic thing . The Lucerne Festival has been such a large part of my life for so many years ; I 've always wanted to aim forwards . "" A further reason for Frang 's 2012 victory , according to jury member Peter Hagmann , was her innate sense of musicality in contemporary repertoire - an aspect which ties in well with the Lucerne Festival 's support for new music as well as for young artists . "" She says that Mozart is important for her , that Bach is important for her , and she approaches the music of Lutoslawski with exactly the same self-evident attitude , "" says Hagmann . "" She uses all her emotional power to communicate this to her public . I think that is a prerequisite for an artist living in the here and now today - that they can not only play this music , but also recognise and care for it , fill it with emotion , and communicate something of their own . She does this in a unique way . "" The daughter of a professional double-bass player , Olso-born Frang always assumed that she would also tend towards the bottom of the string group . Her older sister also played the double bass , and as a toddler , it was the instrument which defined her horizon . "" My father decided I should play the violin instead , "" she remembers . "" He said that there would be no room in our small family car for three double-basses , so we could n't go on holidays unless I played something smaller ! "" From the moment she picked up her first violin as a four-year-old , Frang never looked back . "" It immediately felt right . And although I never found practising in itself intriguing , it was always part of my day . To play was fun . "" At the age of 11 , Frang impressed Anne-Sophie Mutter so profoundly that the eminent German violinist began to play a role in her life as a mentor ; it is Mutter 's Freundeskreis Stiftung that Frank has furnished the violin Frang plays , a 19th-century Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume , and it was Mutter who encouraged her , at the age of 17 , to move to Germany and study privately with Blacher . The rest cannot be said , yet , to be history ; on the contrary , this seems to be a story that is just beginning . Frang agrees . "" This is one of the great moments of my life ; and I 'm quite sure the value of this award is something that will keep growing as the years go by . "" For Frang , growing older also means growing into repertoire that it has taken her time to approach . As a young child , she says , she could only listen to Mozart and Haydn ; Holst and Mussorgsky would have her trembling with genuine terror , much to her sister 's amusement , while Tchaikovsky would reduce her to floods of helpless tears . "" Music always had a very strong impact on me - maybe too strong , "" Frang says . "" And it 's still the same . At a horror movie , I can watch the images , but I ca n't listen to the music .

"and the inheritance tax are putting our system to the test ; this worries me . We have to raise general awareness of Switzerland 's success . Primarily on a liberal labor market . 82 percent of the population between 15 and 64 years of age - more than in any other country - is integrated into working life . In addition , we work more than anyone else in Europe : 41.9 hours per week . The second factor is our very well-trained employees at every level . Our dual educational system is certainly the key to this . Third is our openness towards the rest of the world , where we earn one out of every two francs . And fourth , 20 percent of the gross domestic product comes from industry , and we remain one of the world 's most industrialized countries . This provides stability and is part of the reason we came through the financial crisis so well . As our population continues to age , and with predicted immigration of about 40,000 people per year , we will have a shortage of about 400,000 workers in 2030 . This major gap between the population size and economic performance is the price we pay for our success . Whatever internal efforts we might make , Switzerland will always be dependent on immigration . The initiative against mass immigration and the Ecopop group 's initiative , in contrast , boil down to planned-economy quota-setting and do n't work in practice . In addition , the immigration initiatives threaten the bilateral path that helped Switzerland weather the crisis successfully . The current debate reminds me of the fear of domination by foreign influences in the early 1970s . Some very similar arguments are being used to place the blame for a large share of our problems on the free movement of persons . Immigrants come to Switzerland for various reasons . For example , 7,000 of the 73,000 people who immigrated last year came to our country through marriage . That has absolutely nothing to do with the free movement of persons . But we do need to take certain problems seriously , such as cultural differences with foreign bosses . I think it 's important for business to throw light on this and do everything possible to keep immigration as low as possible . We should more fully utilize the untapped potential for skilled workers who are already in Switzerland . The culture of continuing to work as an older person is completely underdeveloped . In addition , women constitute a large group of potential workers whose productivity can still increase . We have to rethink how things are done - and that takes time . Wage discrimination has lessened significantly in recent years . This problem has been solved with new hires . As for employment relationships that have evolved over time , we have to continue to follow the path we have chosen . Tools such as the pay parity dialogue have been created to help enterprises recognize whether they are providing equal pay for equal work . The statistics indicate otherwise . According to the Gini coefficient ( a statistical measure representing income inequality ) wages are distributed more equally in Switzerland than anywhere else . And the phenomenon of the working poor is on the decline here . In contrast , our cost of living and our demands are increasing . I know families who spend more money on communication than on food . Economic considerations mean that we should focus less on increasing wages and more on how we can lower living costs in our country . There is still work to be done in this regard . Switzerland 's domestic economy is significantly less productive than its export economy . The dual educational system is without doubt a major success , but social pressure threatens to water it down to a high-school type of education . We need reforms in primary school as well . Teaching of the STEM disciplines ( science , technology , engineering and math ) must be emphasized more . After all , Switzerland reached its current level of prosperity thanks in large part to engineering . It was not business people who developed new medicines , machines and time­pieces , but talented people from technical professions . I think that the financial center will continue to change . The "" clean money strategy "" is the strategy of the future , and it will become necessary to win over customers through performance and quality . Along with increasing regulation , this will lead to cost pressure , and additional job cuts in the financial services sector will be necessary . But I 'm certain that the path we are on is the right one , and it 's promising . Switzerland 's banks are competitive and do not have to hide from anyone . Those whose key markets benefit from megatrends such as healthcare , energy , urbanization , water and aging ; that is , pharmaceutical , life science , engineering , and technology companies .

"Anezka Christovova , a currency strategist at Credit Suisse , argued there was no evidence of "" substantial manipulation "" in the past year by the G4 economies , which include the US , EU , Japan and Britain . Any talk suggesting otherwise , the report said , was "" much ado about nothing . "" "" In our view , what we are primarily seeing is a move to increasingly experimental monetary policies aimed at boosting domestic demand , "" Deverell and Christovova said in reference to the massive asset-buying programs of the United States and Japan . Policymakers have had to resort to these "" non-conventional policies "" because lowering interest rates to near zero in response to the global recession failed to revive their stricken economies . "" While this has had an impact on exchange rates , it has not been the focus , "" they said , adding that in "" real effective terms , "" the dollar , yen , euro and sterling were within 10 percent of the 30-year average . "" There is little evidence that current exchange rates are substantially out of equilibrium , "" Deverell and Christovova explained . "" Based on the Credit Suisse fair value model , the ( Chinese ) RMB is the only currency significantly undervalued at present . "" It is not only emerging market currencies that have been appreciating in value . Despite deep economic problems in the Eurozone , the euro had been strengthening before the bailout of Cyprus was announced , fuelling fears that a strong currency could hurt European exporters and further delay the region 's recovery . The euro began rising again once Cypriot banks reopened , and continued as Japan announced its most recent stimulus . The main reason for the euro 's strength , according to Credit Suisse , had been the reduction in the size of the European Central Bank 's balance sheet as euro-area banks began repaying emergency loans to the ECB . The ECB balance sheet is shrinking just when the US Federal Reserve ( Fed ) and the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) are expanding theirs through their respective asset-buying programs , putting upward pressure on the euro . Credit Suisse expects the euro , which has been trading around USD 1.28 , could reach USD 1.40 in the next year , as the Fed buys 85 billion dollars in assets a month and the BOJ recently announced it would accelerate government bond purchases to nearly 84 trillion yen this year , the equivalent of 17 percent of GDP . However , the bank noted that downside risks to the euro were building as European economic conditions deteriorated . The latest Markit composite purchasing managers ' index , which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors , came in at 46.5 in March , compared with 47.9 in February , indicating further contraction in those industries . Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said the data suggested the Eurozone recession was "" deepening . "" European Central Bank President Mario Draghi recently did not rule out an interest rate cut at the ECB 's policy meeting in May , and he left open the door to the use of "" non-standard measures "" to revive the economy , such as bond purchases . With the major economies expected to continue their quantitative easing programs for the duration of 2013 , Credit Suisse warned that emerging market policymakers , especially those who intervene to fix exchange rates , a process known as a dirty float , were "" unlikely to be passive bystanders . "" In a report entitled "" The ' Real ' Currency Wars , "" Credit Suisse said it expected to see "" many dirty floats getting even dirtier over the coming year . """,human
"any broader common issuance is very unlikely at this time , despite the obvious longer term benefits . This is exactly the problem that makes them politically less viable as an option . From the perspective of the stronger countries , the ones that would be providing the credit to back these issuants , the big benefit potentially is that the risk to their financial systems would be reduced from their own banks ' holding of these bonds . However , I think that in the minds of the politicians and possibly the public this risk is not big enough to warrant such a large political step to common euro zone issuance . So while there are advantages for the stronger countries , the amount of fiscal sovereignty that must be given up is still too large to be considered at this point . The future of the euro is intensely linked to the resolution of the euro zone debt crisis . That being said , our view is that although we do n't have a grand and instant solution like a common government bond issuance , the euro zone will hold together . The reasoning for that is precisely because while we face these increasing problems we do have policy response , we have the Stabilization Fund , and , going forward , I believe we will continue to see more of these steps to address immediate liquidity and even solvency issues . It 's this combination of fiscal improvement and ongoing support from the centre that enables us to slowly move towards a stronger fiscal centralization together , even without taking that ultimate step of a common issuance at this point . That , I think , is positive for the euro in terms of stability for the medium to long term . Right now we are in a consolidation phase . The dollar has been remarkable in its inability to benefit from the recent market instability we have seen globally . We 're used to the dollar rallying when other markets are volatile , such as the equity market recently , but that 's been remarkably absent this time . The euro has also held up very well thus far . There 's been a bit of weakness in some of the emerging markets , and some of the commodity-related currencies have softened , but this has all been quite moderate , reflecting a stable situation at current prices . There is also a risk that we will see some dollar strength in the near term , driven by any ongoing instability , particularly if we do n't get any promises of new softer monetary policy steps from the US . In general though , I think we 're going to hold quite stable ranges for the next couple of months . Truly dramatic . The bond market , for example , which has really been the area of interest , has had a dramatic decline in benchmark bond yields around the world , led by the US . This has been driven by an increase in fears of recession on the one hand , and related to that , the possibility in people 's minds that if recession probability increases the Fed ultimately may respond . If that 's the case , it could mean maturity of the Fed 's operations is extended in terms of adding liquidity , which would have a very depressing influence on bond yields . There 's also been tremendous volatility in the equity market . We 've seen a big correction from the recent highs and considerable volatility since then , and the outlook is still uncertain . Not really at all . Japan 's credit rating was also recently downgraded by one of the rating agencies and equally there was very little or almost no impact . The yen actually strengthened on the day , not directly related to the downgrade but by coincidence . You can see that the market is not attaching a lot of significance to these ratings decisions . The big rally in US bonds really occurred alongside the downgrade , not because of it , and I think that will continue to be the case . There 's no doubt the market recognizes that fiscally the deterioration is there , but that 's been recognized for quite a long time and the rating agencies , to some degree , are a bit behind the curve in this sense . We have a very delicate balance in the global economy at the moment . We have ongoing , very simulative monetary policy , which is good for the outlook , and we have very strong growth coming from emerging markets , which have been the powerful engine keeping the global economy strong over the last couple of years . But against that we have some withdrawal , both today and prospectively , of fiscal stimulus and some of the most recent leading indicators have been quite weak . While that reflects the normal to and fro of the cycle , it also raises a tremendous amount of risk . In general , we view the global economic outlook still relatively constructively and have an optimistic opinion that emerging markets will continue to drive global demand , that there will be further rebalancing of growth and that US monetary policy will remain extremely stimulative . However , US unemployment remains quite sticky and Europe 's debt crisis is an issue that affects consumer and business sentiment . But generally we think no recession and a gradually constructive outlook .",human
"seen during the recent recession , however . Yet the 14 percent drop in Swiss goods exports in 2009 was below-average by international standards . US exports were down around 19 percent year-on year , with all the other countries that were analyzed experiencing a decline of more than 20 percent ( Italy : -25 percent ; UK : -24 percent ; Germany : -23 percent ; France : -22 percent ) . This less sharp decline during the recession meant that Swiss exports returned to their pre-crisis level comparatively quickly . An important reason for the Swiss export industry 's resistance to crisis is the sector portfolio , which is less volatile than that of Germany , France , Italy , the UK , or the US . Switzerland 's below-average volatility is mainly the result of the high weighting of the relatively non-cyclical pharmaceutical industry and the small share of vehicle manufacturing in Swiss exports . The remaining sectors account for a fairly similar share of total exports for Switzerland and the other countries included in the comparison ; on this account , therefore , there are no specific advantages or disadvantages in terms of Switzerland 's ability to withstand crisis . As a small , open economy , Switzerland is more vulnerable than most to external shocks . Keeping its dependence on individual countries to a minimum is a good means of reducing its vulnerability . However , our analysis shows that Switzerland has room for improvement on this score . Although all sectors are better diversified than the average for the OECD countries , they still lag behind their competitors in the main neighboring countries , as well as the UK and the US . The need to catch up is particularly great in the medical technology and metal industries , while the pharmaceuticals and watch industries boast better geographical diversification . Broad geographical diversification not only helps in terms of capitalizing on growth sources in as many countries as possible but also creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuations . The high quality of Swiss exports is likely to have had a positive influence on the country 's resistance to crisis . In our research , we use the average price of the goods per unit of weight ( kilogram ) - the unit value - as indicator of the quality of exports . Greater input of human capital , superior technology , higher-value materials and more reliable production processes improve the qualitative properties of a product and accordingly justify a higher price compared with the original use of materials based on weight . The higher quality of a product is therefore reflected in a higher unit value . Not only does Switzerland show the highest mean unit values across all exported goods but the relationship between the value of imported goods and that of exports is at a record level . That Switzerland is so far ahead of all the countries in the comparison is due not least to the fact that compared with other countries the unit value of exports is much less significantly reduced by sectors with characteristically lower values . The automotive industry , for example , is considerably more important in Germany . Although it is among the most technology-intensive sectors of the economy , it falls well short of the figures for the high-tech industries of precision instruments , pharmaceuticals , and watches . A high share for food production ( France , US , UK ) also has an unfavorable impact on the overall position . Owing to the importance of its textile and clothing industry ( which typically exhibits a favorable value / weight ratio ) , Italy is well ahead . The relevance of unit value is improved by comparing the various countries at sector level . We excluded the examples of chemicals , pharmaceuticals , electrical engineering and machinery from the study . Based on the difference in unit values for exported versus imported goods , in combination with the information on imported and exported volumes ( volume-based balance of trade ) , we can determine whether each individual export goods sector is in a price or quality-sensitive market , and whether the sector has a corresponding advantage relative to its competitors . This analysis shows that most Swiss exports compete on quality . In 2010 , this share stood at 63 percent . It comes as no surprise that Swiss exports are generally at an advantage when competing on quality . Only six percent of the goods that compete on quality show a disadvantage relative to foreign rivals . When competing on price , on the other hand , just under 10 percent of Swiss goods are at an advantage : In 90 percent of cases , the advantage lies with the foreign competitor . This confirms the finding that Switzerland is significantly less competitive when it comes to pricing . There are clear indications that the quality of products of the Swiss export goods industry makes a material contribution to success . The export heavyweights of pharmaceuticals , machinery and electrical engineering appear well positioned . But if the Swiss export industry wishes to remain successful in the future , it will absolutely need to maintain its lead in terms of quality and technology . This means it will need to continue developing through constant innovation . Other economies - primarily in the emerging-market countries - will seek to replicate these qualities at lower cost . The "" price premium "" versus competitors therefore needs to be reinforced repeatedly through continuous improvements and outstanding service .",human
"have a slightly dampening effect on demand for residential property . However , this will not be enough to snuff out price rises entirely . We expect price rises to ease only slightly to 3-5 percent this year - as a result the risk of a market correction is increasing . However , apart from an unexpected recession , a sharp rise in interest rates is the only thing likely to halt price growth . As long as no substantial rise in interest rates threatens to undermine the market , there are currently three factors preventing it from entering the final stage of overheating . First , speculative transactions remain relatively limited . Second , lending has been curbed by many institutions against the backdrop of tighter monitoring and growing risks . Third , there is as yet no oversupply on the residential property market . Structural weaknesses in the construction sector are making it impossible to produce more apartments , even though the supply pipeline is full . The scarcity of residential space in central locations will therefore remain an issue in 2013 . Increasing vacancy rates tend to become noticeable in peripheral and rural regions first . The overall vacancy rate in Switzerland will once again be below the long-term average of 1 percent this year , albeit only slightly . A substantial rise in interest rates would lead high property prices to be reflected in rising running costs for homeowners : immediately in the case of new buyers and with a slight delay on average for existing owners . This would choke demand and push up vacancy rates . However , the trend in commercial property is very different . Although prices have risen significantly here too , there is little sign of overheating of demand as there is for owner-occupied residential property . On the contrary , the office market is seeing rising vacancy rates . Office developments financed with low interest rates are attracting large companies to cheaper locations ( but still with good transport links ) outside town centers . Many companies take advantage of such out-of-town moves to bring together a number of different locations efficiently while also saving costs . The vacancies which this development leaves behind in the town centers can mostly be filled again over time , but usually only after landlords have made pricing concessions . The growing trend toward new ways of working is accentuating this situation . "" Desk sharing , "" for example , gives companies much greater flexibility in managing their space requirements . On average it allows a space saving of 10-20 percent . The benefits of desk sharing are so appealing that more and more companies are trying out similar new approaches , and this is having an appreciable impact on overall demand for office space across the economy . Combined with the full supply pipeline , the rise in the supply figures toward the end of 2012 could be a harbinger of a possible future oversupply and rising vacancy rates on the office property market . This oversupply will be alleviated by the ongoing tertiarization process within industry . The increasing orientation of industrial companies toward services is leading to rising demand for office space .",human
"stroke . While it may appear easy , even monotonous , when viewed from the shore , rowing is a strenuous sport that requires skill and coordination . "" One motion follows the next , smoothly and harmoniously . There 's no beginning or end , "" Cornelia explains . "" A jerky movement would upset the boat 's delicate balance and throw us off course . "" The rowers ' smooth , cyclical movements would seem to induce a meditative state , but Cornelia never allows herself to get lost in thought . On the contrary : "" Rowing requires my full concentration , since there is so much to keep track of : keeping my legs , arms , and upper body at precisely the proper angles , transferring energy to the sculls as efficiently as possible , the rhythm of my fellow rowers . If I were to start daydreaming or mulling over a problem , the boat would quickly go off course . Concentrating solely on my physical movements and on the here and now is a perfect way to take a break from my everyday responsibilities . "" Even the panorama disappears from view , at least for a while - since rowers face not where they 're headed , but where they 're coming from ; their gaze is fixed on their point of departure . Only when they turn around , after about five kilometers , does Cornelia have a couple of minutes to relax and admire the scenery , bathed in the morning light . The sunrise , snow-covered mountains , families of swans - all of it so beautiful that it seems almost unreal . Back at their starting point , she takes a deep breath , then returns to the clubhouse . After a quick shower , she heads to work at the Uetlihof , where she arrives no later than 8:30 a.m . It was at a team event eight years ago that Cornelia was first introduced to rowing . Immediately drawn to a sport that takes place in the fresh air , and fascinated by its complex technical requirements , she underwent the necessary basic training and then joined the Zurich rowing club . Since then she has trained nearly every morning - on the water or , in stormy weather , on a rowing machine . Does n't she get tired of waking up so early ? "" Oh , no , "" she says with a smile . "" I sleep in on the weekends - training does n't start until 7:30 . "" Nor is she worried that she 'll eventually find rowing monotonous . She loves the sport - "" the feeling you get when everything goes well , when the boat flies across the water "" - and training , too , is anything but boring . Cornelia is a member of several different rowing teams that use a variety of boats : On Monday she 's in the eight , which is her favorite because it uses energy most efficiently and travels across the lake at the highest rate of speed . On Tuesdays and Wednesdays she trains in a double scull , on Thursdays in a pair - where the rowers use one oar rather than two - and on Fridays in a four or in a quadruple scull . On the weekends she sometimes goes out in a single , also known as a skiff . "" With so many types of boats , there 's always something new to learn , "" Cornelia explains . "" My next goal is to get better at controlling the skiff . "" Competing in a regatta is not one of her goals , however , since that would require even more training , not to mention more time in the weight room . "" I 'll continue to take part in friendly competitions from time to time , but aside from that I just want to improve , so I 'm working on my technique . My recent training with the German national team in Dortmund made it abundantly clear that I have room for improvement , "" Cornelia admits with a laugh . Working with a team is one aspect of rowing that she particularly enjoys . "" That may sound trite , since team spirit is important in any number of sports . But when you 're rowing , you really have to focus on ­coordinating your movements with those of your teammates , much more so than in basketball or football , for example , "" she says . "" It 's counterproductive to focus only on yourself , since we 're all in the same boat - literally - and pulling together . "" Zurich Rowing Club",human
"life expectancy is currently 73.7 years for men and 76.8 years for women . It is a fact that life patterns are changing . The boundaries between the individual life stages are becoming increasingly blurred . So are the lines between education and gainful employment - thanks to longer study programs and lifelong learning - and those between work and retirement , as a result of flexible retirement options . Until now , the regulatory framework of AHV has only reacted cautiously to these changes and challenges . Astonishing , considering that we can forecast fairly reliably that the population will age . Depending on the assumptions , scenarios and models can differ slightly , but they remain the same in their basic message : The ratio of older people to people of working age has increased steadily over the course of time and will , in the future , change even more rapidly to the detriment of the younger generation . This trend places a growing strain on the pay-as-you-go AHV and charts the road into deficit . Though in an international comparison , Switzerland is still doing very well in terms of their retirement provision with the three-pillar system composed of occupational and private pension schemes , in addition to the AHV state pension . In around half of OECD countries , people will need to work longer in the future before they can retire . In contrast , little has changed in Switzerland since increasing the retirement age for women from 62 to 64 years of age under the 10th AHV revision . The uniform retirement age of 65 for both men and women was rejected with the 11th AHV revision of 2010 . What needs to be done in order to also secure pensions in the long term for future generations ? Reforms of the AHV can basically target either funding or benefits . Discussions on funding focus mainly on a higher percentage of wages or tax increases ( usually a value-added tax increase ) . But raising the percentage of wages increases the labor production factor . As a result , it burdens only the current workforce and has a more drastic impact on competitiveness than a value-added tax increase . A higher value-added tax , however , also has a negative economic impact in that it raises the cost of private consumption . On the benefits side , pension standards can be adjusted , limiting expenses to some extent . But this does nothing to change the growing burden on the active generations from the growing number of retirees under the pay-as-you-go system . This burden can only be counteracted in a sustainable manner by changing the mathematical ratio between those entitled to a pension and those contributing . There is no alternative to raising the statutory retirement age or making it flexible in an upward direction . Implementing a debt brake for social insurance along with adequate automated processes would be helpful in achieving this . And extending the length of working life has long since ceased to be a revolutionary idea . According to a recent study by the Federal Social Insurance Office , more and more working people in Switzerland are continuing to work past the retirement age . From 2008 to 2011 , this number averaged just over one-third . In contrast , the trend toward extending early retirement has weakened , although in past decades , retirement provision regulations and a concerted focus on youth in the job market fostered this trend . There is therefore a substantial potential pool of workers who would like to continue working . However , the job market lacks a systematic human resources policy to address this proven need . In order to promote the employment of older workers by creating more flexible conditions to take full advantage of their experience and expertise , employers will have to rethink their position . This is in their own interest , too , as they will soon be confronted with an increasingly aging staff .",human

"and the Lac Léman ( Lake Geneva ) region . Around 140,000 to 160,000 vehicles pass through the Wallisellen interchange , where the A1 and A4 motorways come together , every day . At the 12th Lifefair Forum in October , where the topic was "" Where is Swiss Transportation Policy Steering Us ? "" ( see box ) , leading minds from the worlds of politics , transportation and economics came together to discuss public and private transportation in Switzerland . The debate centered on the national road system - not surprising in light of the upcoming vote on November 24 , in which the country will vote on whether to approve a change to the federal law on national roadway tolls . At issue is a proposed increase in the price of the motorway vignette , which allows the use of all Swiss motorways and expressways , from 40 francs to 100 francs . The hike is expected to bring in 300 million francs in additional revenue , which the federal government plans to invest in expanding the road network and financing the takeover of national roadways by the federal government . Parliament approved the bill in the spring of 2013 , but it was met with quick opposition , and a referendum committee gathered enough signatures to take the matter to a public vote . The topic is now the subject of hot debate . Leading those in favor of the bill is Federal Councilor Doris Leuthard . As head of the Federal Department of Environment , Transport , Energy and Communications ( DETEC ) , Leuthard gave an introductory presentation at the Lifefair Forum , in which she called the price increase necessary and reasonable given the sharp rise in roadway use and the proposed investments . According to Leuthard , the infrastructure is reaching its limits . More and more people commute , with ever-increasing distances between home and work . In fact , she emphasized , Switzerland 's excellent road network is a major reason the country is considered one of the world 's most competitive economies . "" We must invest , and we must stop engaging in ideological warfare . "" According to Leuthard , an annual 60-franc increase in the vignette price would help Switzerland guarantee a quality road system and fair financing of the national road network , as well as ensure that all the country 's regions benefit from the expansion . The National Council approved the bill with 102 votes to 87 ; it also passed the Council of States by 37 to 4 . Arguments against the proposal come from the left as well as the right sides of the political spectrum : both Bastien Girod , National Councilor for the Green Party , and Walter Frey , former National Councilor , Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) Vice President and owner and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Emil Frey Group , are against raising the price of the vignette . Joining them on the Lifefair panel were Kathrin Amacker , Head of Communications & Public Affairs for the Swiss Federal Railways ; Hans-Jörg Bertschi , Board Chairman and CEO of Bertschi AG ; Ernst Stocker , Zurich Cantonal Councilor for the SVP and Director of Economic Affairs ; and Ulrich Walt , Head of Logistics at Holcim Europe . Frey sees the bill as an urgent necessity . "" But financing is another issue altogether , "" he adds . Eighty percent of public transportation takes place via roads , despite much heavier investments in the rail network in recent times . "" Roads are on the defensive , "" says Frey . With drivers already covering over 100 percent of the cost of the road network , he feels the bump in price is likely to leave a sour taste in their mouth . Girod counters that the 100 percent cost coverage cited by Frey does n't include environmental and other external costs not incurred by drivers . He is against the vignette price increase for other reasons . For him , mobility pricing , in which fees are collected for actual road usage , is a better solution . "" It would give us better cost transparency . "" Business owner Hans-Jörg Bertschi does n't support this model , but he did criticize the more expensive vignette as a "" tax on leaving your car at home . "" The Zurich Cantonal Council is in favor of the bill . Its representative at the Forum , Director of Economic Affairs Ernst Stocker , pointed to the enormous increase in traffic in and around the city of Zurich . "" A large infrastructure project takes 20 to 30 years from planning to implementation . That 's why we need to say yes today , "" he stressed . Holcim logistics manager Ulrich Walt believes that , while the annual 60-franc increase is reasonable , the need is relative . "" Compared to many other countries , we 're doing quite well in this area , and our traffic jams are a lot less dramatic , "" says Walt . The debate over the price of the motorway vignette raises another important basic question : do we really need as much transportation as we have today ? Are we on the road too much ? Girod takes a critical stance with regard to transportation in today 's world . "" We do n't need more asphalt , we need greater efficiency . "" According to Girod , for most commuters , driving to work every day is a burden rather than a joy ; studies show that people actually overestimate the positive effects of comfort at home while they underestimate the value of a shorter commute . Frey counters the scenario of deliberately reducing transportation options by stressing the importance of economic growth , which he feels would not be possible if we cut back on transportation . "" People , not roads , create traffic . "" As Kathrin Amacker adds , it 's a matter of Swiss identity as well . "" Ordinary Swiss people have the benefit of being able to travel around the country or commute to work , even if they do n't have a lot of money , "" she states . According to Amacker , raising taxes is n't simple , either , as it puts an unfair burden on the less wealthy section of the population , who might need to take a job in another city in order to survive , thus impacting the mobility of the job market . When Doris Leuthard came forward after the panel discussion to give her final remarks to the audience , she welcomed the lively debate , which had made it clear just how complex the topic of transportation policy and mobility is in Switzerland , going far beyond the price of the motorway vignette and touching on basic issues regarding environmental and economic policy and even national identity . "" Multimodal mobility "" is in demand , stressed the Federal Councilor . "" We need investments in railways and roads . """,human
"is not enough . They want to accumulate wealth in a responsible way and have become increasingly concerned about the social , environmental and ethical issues . Asset managers are therefore expected to demonstrate appropriate investment behavior by taking thoughtful decisions and actions . Naturally , one has to ask : Do the numbers add up ? In the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2015 , Elroy Dimson , Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton examine the topic of "" vice "" versus "" responsible "" investing . The study compares the performance of two contrasting funds : The Vice Fund ( recently renamed as the Barrier Fund ) and the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund . Both are US mutual funds and were launched in the early 2000s . The former invests in businesses considered to be socially questionable : tobacco , alcohol , gaming and defence / aerospace industries . The latter is composed of stocks of companies that have been screened for certain social , human rights and environmental criteria . Data gathered over a period of nearly 14 years shows that the Vice Fund performed better and is the winner of this comparison ( 10,000 US dollars growing from inception to 33,655 US dollars at start- 2015 ) . Although the Social Index Fund also recorded growth , its rate was lower ( 10,000 US dollars growing to 26,788 US dollars ) . The example of the Vice Fund and much of the evidence reviewed by the London Business School researchers suggest that investments in what are considered "" unethical "" stocks tend to outperform . According to Dan Ahrens , author of "" Investing in Vice : The Recession Proof Portfolio of Booze , Bets , Bombs and Butts , "" the rationale for "" vice "" investing and its success is that these companies have a steady demand for their goods and services , regardless of economic conditions . They operate globally , tend to be high-margin businesses and they are in industries with high entry barriers . Just to complete the picture , the researchers reached out to another unsettling study - one that investigates stock markets in countries characterized by corruption . The study concludes that better returns were generated from investments made in the countries generally considered most corrupt . It may seem surprising , but responsible investors may also contribute to the outperformance of "" sin stocks . "" As Elroy Dimson , Emeritus Professor of Finance , London Business School and Chairman of the Newton Centre for Endowment Asset Management at Cambridge University , indicates : "" If a large enough proportion of investors avoids sin businesses , their share prices will be depressed , thereby offering the prospect of elevated returns to those less troubled by ethical considerations . "" To get a long-term perspective at sin stocks ' performance , the Credit Suisse study had a closer look at over 100 years of tobacco industry data . It is worth mentioning that tobacco was not considered harmful until the 1950s and , for the first half of the 20th century , the industry 's status was neutral . However , once its negative impact became widely recognized , its status shifted from neutral to "" sinful "" and some investors started rejecting the tobacco business on ethical grounds . How did this affect the industry 's performance ? During the transition period , 1947-1965 , shares in the tobacco industry underperformed by 3 percent per year in the USA . Still , it was a temporary trend and the decades from the 1960s to the 2000s , when the health impact of tobacco was well known , saw tobacco companies outperforming comparable firms by over+ 3 percent per year . Despite this rather grim picture , there is some good news too . The London Business School researchers have evidence that responsible investing can be fruitful . For responsible investors , who still have a stake in companies deemed non-ethical , there are two options : "" exit "" and "" voice . "" Exit , meaning withdrawing from the investment relationship , can relate to companies , industries and even whole markets . This is a very radical step . Investors who choose to exit not only burn their investment bridges , but can also - unintentionally - positively contribute to performance of sin stocks , as described above . Voice , on the other hand , can be a very powerful tool . Investors can speak out in an attempt to improve corporate behavior . They may hold discussions with executives , send written communications , submit and vote on proxy proposals , and seek to influence regulators and standard setters . The authors of the Credit Suisse study are convinced that : "" These activities are undertaken in the belief that responsible investors can guide management toward improved financial performance and / or enhanced social conditions for stakeholders and communities . "" The California Public Employees ' Retirement System ( CalPERS ) is an example that has shown that the voice strategy can in many ways be more rewarding than exit . In 2002 , CalPERS blacklisted entire countries that fell short of a minimal threshold on factors such as political stability , democratic institutions , transparency , labor practices , corporate responsibility and disclosure . The results were costly : after four years of applying this policy , the losses on its emerging markets portfolio were over 400 mln US dollars . In 2007 CalPERS decided to switch to a principles-based approach and , instead of excluding entire markets , started carefully selecting companies in the developing world . It chose to use voice rather than exit within emerging markets , and embraced dialogue , engagement and shareholder activism . According to Credit Suisse 's report , engagement is not only socially responsible , but has also proven to be profitable . The researchers analyzed the post-engagement performance of investee companies over the course of one year after the engagement . While it is not surprising that successful actions resulted in material gains ( +7.1 percent ) , the conclusion that unsuccessful engagements did not do any harm to company value is extremely important and encourages responsible investing ( they were met with a neutral market reaction ) . The gathered evidence shows that responsible investing can pay , but it requires much more effort . If investors want to be rewarded financially , they have to do more than just buy shares in responsibly managed companies . Rather , engagement with the companies whose shares they own or wish to buy seems to be the right course of action . The authors of the Credit Suisse study advise that "" to maximize the probability of success , asset owners might consider the ' washing machine ' strategy : buying non-responsible companies and turning them into more responsible businesses . "" After they have been cleaned up , the shares may then be sold at a price that reflects the accomplishments of the activist . While it is not for everyone , such a strategy offers an interesting direction for responsible asset owners .",human
"conditions in Switzerland as being conducive to success . The SMEs believe the factors infrastructure and employees / qualifications have a particularly positive influence on business success . However , the SMEs ' overall assessment of Switzerland as a business location has deteriorated slightly compared with the previous year . The appreciation of the Swiss franc since the abandonment of the EUR / CHF exchange-rate floor is having negative effects : By and large , SMEs view the impact of the economic environment and Switzerland 's international ties on their success this year as negative . Regulatory framework conditions are once again judged to be an impediment to success . In terms of the economic environment and regulation , many firms expect a further deterioration in future . In light of these views , the issue of easing the regulatory burden on businesses needs to move higher up the political agenda if Swiss SMEs ' chances of success are to be secured - particularly in a more troubled economic climate . 90 percent of the SMEs surveyed made investments between 2009 and 2014 , spending an average of 10 percent of their sales . Investment as a proportion of sales was highest in the case of service-sector companies ( 16 percent ) and the high-tech industry ( 10 percent ) , and lowest in retail ( 5 percent ) . Real estate was the biggest area of investment with a 47 percent share of the total , followed by equipment ( 42 percent ) . The survey also shows that real estate investment has gained importance for all sectors in the last six years . In particular , SMEs from the tourism and entertainment sectors , as well as the healthcare , education and social services sectors , were above-average investors in real estate ; high-tech industry , on the other hand , spent an above-average proportion on research and development . Just 6 percent of all SMEs surveyed invested abroad between 2009 and 2014 . The survey shows that SMEs believe the Swiss franc 's appreciation in January this year is likely to be more difficult to absorb than that seen in 2010/2011 . 40 percent of all SMEs surveyed expect sales and margins to fall following this year 's Swiss franc appreciation , with 30 percent anticipating a decline in competitiveness . SMEs in the industrial and retail sectors in particular are under strong pressure . Although 72 percent of the SMEs surveyed are sticking to their investment plans despite the strong Swiss franc , 20 percent are planning a reduction - and in the high-tech industry the figure is as high as 44 percent . According to the survey , those SMEs that are reducing their investment due to the stronger Swiss franc are more export-oriented than those SMEs whose investment is unchanged or increasing . In addition , SMEs that are planning a reduction in investment due to the strong Swiss franc are more likely to expect the currency 's appreciation to have a negative effect on sales , margins and competitiveness than the other SMEs . The results of the survey also show that diversification in the form of strategic interests and cooperation agreements to some extent alleviates the negative effect of Swiss franc appreciation on SME investment . In addition , the margins and competitiveness of Swiss SMEs that invested abroad between 2009 and 2014 are less frequently affected by the current strength of the Swiss franc compared to SMEs that only invested domestically . According to the survey , Swiss SMEs mainly use cash and traditional bank loans to finance investment . In the case of young businesses , non-bank loans also play an important role . In overall terms , the multi-year spell of low interest rates has provided only a moderate boost to SME investment activity : Nearly one-third of the SMEs questioned indicate that low interest rates between 2009 and 2014 had a positive effect on the level of investment ; more than 60 percent said they had no influence . One reason is likely to be the fact that uncertainty about the future course of the economy often plays a greater role than financing conditions when it comes to investment decisions . The situation appears slightly different in construction , which has benefited from low interest rates in two ways : As well as lowering firms ' own financing costs , low interest rates and the attendant cheaper mortgages have increased the demand for real estate and therefore construction services . For 73 percent of the SMEs surveyed , the replacement of outdated infrastructure was an important motive for investment in the 2009-2014 period - no other reason was more frequently cited as important . 65 percent of the SMEs described improved efficiency as an important reason to invest - and among the industrial SMEs surveyed it was the most frequently as important cited reason for investing . According to the survey , measures to boost efficiency and maintain competitiveness are likely to gain importance for Swiss SMEs in 2015 and 2016 . In line with the results regarding success factors , regulation is a big obstacle to investment for the SMEs surveyed : Around one-third of SME respondents stated that laws and regulations had severely hampered key investment projects in 2009 - 2014 . For more than one-quarter of the SMEs surveyed , economic and political uncertainty as well as the shortage of specialist skills were major obstacles to investment . A total of 58 percent of the SMEs were unable to execute substantial investment projects as planned between 2009 and 2014 ; this was due to insufficient demand , economic and political uncertainty , regulation , a shortage of specialist skills , or - if in significantly fewer cases - a lack of finance . A total of 23 percent of the SMEs in the survey stated they were satisfied with their investment activity as well as the sales and margins generated in the 2009-2014 period . The results of the survey show that these SMEs in particular invested more heavily in employee training and research and development than companies that were dissatisfied with either their investment activity , their sales or their margins . In addition , their investment activity was less frequently hampered by political and economic uncertainty . The success of Swiss SMEs is therefore founded on three key pillars : qualified employees , innovation and stability . According to the survey , SMEs are thoroughly aware of the crucial importance of human capital . Four-fifths of the SMEs surveyed have invested in the training of their staff in the past six years . While companies are able to influence the employees and innovation factors themselves , Credit Suisse economists would urge politicians in particular to improve stability and planning security for Swiss SMEs .",human
"by deterioration or waste . The term "" wastage "" encompasses both food loss and food waste . Food Waste : This refers to all foodstuffs appropriate for human consumption but are nevertheless discarded . Food Loss : This refers to a decrease in mass or quality of foodstuffs which were originally intended for human consumption . In industrialized countries and emerging economies , it is consumers who are largely responsible for wasted foodstuffs . The lack of coordination between the different players in the supply chain also often means that more food is produced than can ultimately be sold . Food waste includes misshapen fruits which are regarded as substandard , according to current quality criteria , as well as products that have passed their sell-by date and left-overs that are thrown away . Increased awareness among consumers could reduce the amount of food being rejected and discarded at the end of the supply chain . Now for the first time , a recently published In developing countries , logistical , technical , and financial limitations lead to serious losses during production and transportation of foodstuffs . This is alarming given the fact that global production needs to be increased by 60 percent by 2050 , in order to provide for a growing world population with changing diets . Both the public and private sector need to invest in infrastructure , transport and packaging industries of developing countries in order to increase production and at the same time prevent the loss of foodstuffs . More efficient food production reduces costs for consumers and thus contributes to improved access for disadvantaged groups of people . Speed is a fundamental factor in the fight against production loss . The faster the foodstuffs move along the supply chain , the lower the probability that they will go bad . One simple way of accelerating this process is to set up processing plants closer to production facilities . But what sounds logical remains a huge challenge for many developing countries and one that cannot be overcome without support from both the private and public sectors . What seems unthinkable in many developing countries occurs on a daily basis in high income countries : Foodstuffs intended for sale or consumption are thrown away . In Europe and North America , an average of 95 to 115 kilos of foodstuffs per head is thrown away annually . In sub-Saharan countries the average is only between 6 and 11 kilos . Poor communication and cooperation between producers lead to foodstuffs having to be discarded when production exceeds demand . High quality standards concerning the appearance of vegetables and fruit also mean that many foodstuffs are rejected and are not put on sale . However , there has recently been a rethink in this respect and supermarket chains have increasingly begun to display three-legged carrots or bent cucumbers on their shelves . Explaining the significance of sell-by and expiry dates can also help to encourage consumers to behave responsibly . According to Peter Hess , quality coordinator at DSR , one of two providers of Credit Suisse staff restaurants , the most efficient way to reduce food waste would be "" if guests became more tolerant regarding the offer at the end of the service . If the salad bar does n't have to look filled until the end of service , less will have to be disposed for food safety reasons at the end of the day . "" Even if the reduction in food waste does not solve all the problems of the global supply shortage , it is nonetheless one way in which each and every individual can make an effective contribution . During the week of June 5 , 2013 ( World Environment Day ) , as part of the United Nations Environment Program 's Think.Eat.Save campaign , Credit Suisse 's Sustainability Network in Switzerland launched an information campaign in all staff restaurants in Switzerland on the subject of food waste . Food waste is measured on a regular basis in Credit Suisse staff restaurants , and in order to reduce food waste measures determined on an annual basis are implemented . "" Precise planning by the chef is as essential as continuous fresh production and the service personnel 's trained eye for the guest , "" says Alexander Poelman , Key Account Manager at SV Group . With these measures , the food waste could be reduced by about 30g per plate since 2006 . The Sustainability Network enables employees to organize internal events and activities and thus to benefit from the creation of cross-divisional and cross-regional networks . The network 's job is to promote awareness about questions of sustainability , and about the bank 's activities on these issues , with the aim of supporting innovations in this area .",human
": Rural and urban , farmer and industrial worker , young person and old person ? It turns out that social networks like Twitter , and also traditional television , are a way to mobilize . In the campaign where President Obama came from being an unknown to President of the United States he was able to make use of the medium in ways no one else had figured out . Social networks have become a very important part of messaging , of outreach , communicating with constituents , of defining yourself , of discussing policy . However at the same time they can be used to spread distruths . You can say something that becomes viral overnight and it is simply not true . To undo that you have to create a viral spread in the other direction . But we 're learning how this medium will be used in the political process and we 've seen both good and disturbing examples of it . The role of advertising and money in campaigns is linked to this . In the US we spend a lot of money on campaigns and they 're years in the making . Therefore , the medium will become more important in societies where there 's a long electoral cycle and a lot of money in the process . They have the ability to be used in positive and negative ways and we should think of them as facilitators : you can facilitate good and bad things . Take the uprisings in the Middle East for example : facilitating discontent and bringing people together to move those regimes , you could argue , was a positive effect . However , now those regimes have to be rebuilt . That takes time , patience and continued bringing together of people with diverse interests . Whether a social medium will help in that regard is an open question . Further , we know from behavioral economics that people tend to join a herd . We sign onto something because others do . We believe something without looking at the evidence because our friends do . You could see how a social network could exacerbate those tendencies : You get overconfident because you use a network with people who think like you do , you do n't question . There 's a value of diversity in decision making in organizations and the more the social network is focused on people with similar opinions , the less diversity you get . That is a negative effect . The situation in China is interesting . It has a very active blogging community but it 's quite controlled in many respects . If people want to complain about a local official they can , and actively do . There are cases where local officials have lost their authority because of complaints . People also complain about consumer products and safety standards . There 's also a huge amount of nationalism in China , where anti-Japan attitudes are largely reflected in blogs or social networks . That could put pressure on the authorities to undertake an activity which is n't really the right public policy . The Chinese experience indicates that you can control parts , while keeping certain parts free and open . In the US , the general presumption is that everything should be open ; everyone should be able to say anything they want . The concern there is about distorted and untruthful information that does not determine the source . Yes , it 's something you hear about and decide to join . But particularly in China , and to a lesser extent in the US , active users are also using it for entertainment and gaming , not generally for political reasons . They 're also using it for their friends . Studies by anthropologists suggest that most people have about 150 people in their real network , whose names and connection they can remember . So while on Facebook you may post a lot of information , you 're really only interacting with ten people , not 300 . Exactly . I 've also heard discussions about whether Facebook makes you narcissistic , because who cares about your photos or what you did this morning ? You do , but you 're presuming that hundreds of others do as well . It 's wonderful to speculate about this now . Social networks are so new that we do n't know the answers to most of these questions . We do know you have to pay attention to it and we do know we 're in a transition .",human
"minutes , the man has reached his workplace , 60 meters up , and starts his maintenance task . "" There 's no reason why anyone should still have to climb an 80- or 100-meter-high pylon , "" says Andreas Maurer , founder and CEO of HighStep Systems AG . "" In the past , there were only two ways of getting to elevated workplaces : a ladder or a pre-installed lift . Ladders are dangerous and inconvenient , and conventional lifts are expensive . Our systems offer safe and cost-effective alternatives . "" Safety is important to Maurer , as the idea for his business came to him after his father had fallen from a ladder in the garden eight years previously . "" We asked ourselves why there were no really safe ladders even though many people have to work in elevated locations like electricity pylons or wind turbines , "" explains the graduate engineer . The result of these deliberations was the foundation of HighStep Systems in 2007 and a short time later the development of a climbing system that outperforms traditional ladders in more than just safety . Another key advantage is ergonomic : The new system facilitates comfortable working positions and thus reduces fatigue . The user stands upright , does not have to work with stretched arms , can choose his own step length , and can rest safely at all times . "" Industry has recognized these advantages , because it is suffering from a particular demographic trend : Young technicians are becoming rarer , while older technicians often suffer from knee or back problems . In the case where the climbing element is removed , technicians are able to work longer , "" explains Maurer . The key feature of the HighStep system is an aluminum rail which is securely connected to the structure along its entire length . The mobile climbing equipment - either the basic model with which the technician propels himself or the lift - is then attached to this rail . The latter is the world 's first portable lift . "" TÜV certification of our lift , which we expect to receive in the near future , will trigger the second big growth spurt for us , "" declares a confident Maurer . To keep investments to a minimum , the company does not produce its products , but relies on outsourcing partners : The rails are supplied by German company Aluminium-Werke Wutöschingen AG , and the other components are made by Faes AG of Switzerland . At present , the key markets for HighStep systems are electricity pylons and wind turbines - both new and pre-existing structures . "" We are the only company that can retrofit lifts to existing structures , "" explains the CEO . This means that the company has a very promising market . In Europe alone , there are over a million electricity pylons and around 72,000 wind turbines . And both of these markets are growing . As the electricity network is extended , the number of pylons increases ; and the demand for new energy sources is generating annual growth of over 20 percent in the field of wind power . The potential is even greater if one considers the international markets . Yet that 's something that this small business with just ten employees is not yet able to cope with . "" For capacity reasons , we are still reacting cautiously to inquiries from China and India . But that will change in time , "" says the CEO . He 's thinking not just about expanding geographically but also about new business lines . HighStep systems could also be used in high-rack warehouses or on cranes , lampposts , tall buildings , and oil or gas tankers . The team is already considering new product types that could be attached to the rails , a materials transporter for example , or a robot that could be fitted with cameras to perform monitoring functions . Despite its brief history , the company can already look back on a number of milestones . In 2008 , one year after it was founded , the first major client to commit to the climbing system was Axpo . Others followed , and in 2010 alone , HighStep Systems fitted its system on more than 1,000 pylons - generating a few millions in revenues in the process . Four patents have also been registered worldwide . "" Besides all that , we have secured finance to help us grow - thanks not least to SVC - Ltd . , "" says Andreas Maurer . "" SVC - Ltd . provided a loan and has also helped with business development , marketing , and finding partners in specific countries . "" The biggest challenges so far have been the economic situation in Europe , particularly . Like most SMEs , HighStep Systems has been affected by the financial crisis and the strength of the Swiss franc . The fear of a recession and the ongoing pressure on costs have tended to make clients more cautious . Nevertheless , Maurer is looking forward to the future with confidence : "" Although the operating environment is set to remain difficult in the short term , the growing focus on safety at work and society 's demographic problems will ensure that our revenues will rise in the mid- to long-term . If we can exploit the potential of this market , we could see revenues of 100 or 200 million Swiss francs . """,human
"mainly on the changing role of the banks and the dollar . US and European banks , but not those in Asia or Latin America , have taken unprecedented losses during the crisis . To plug the gap , these banks have raised capital from governments and private investors . However , there are further major losses still in the pipeline for many banks , and these will swallow up a substantial part of their profits for the next ten years . Looking beyond that , the big structural issue is whether the US and European banks embark on a major new round of leveraging-up and risk-taking to fund economic growth in their own economies and abroad , or whether they take a back seat , with local emerging market banks and direct investment flows through the capital markets being in the lead . Over the last few decades , many of the US and European banks have generally recovered reasonably quickly from credit slumps and started robust loan expansion again , but will it be different this time ? Currently , the political debate in America and Europe is focused on ways to restrain such leverage and risk-taking . Governments can enforce this through three main routes . First , by explicit direction to banks in which they have invested - but most governments are reluctant to go too far with this , and anyway they are looking to sell their stakes sooner or later . Second is by requiring banks to break up into smaller and perhaps specialized units , but this is controversial and could damage the competitiveness of the banks affected if it is not done in all countries . Third is by tightening regulations . For example , banks could be forced to build up extra capital buffers in good years , to be run down in the bad years ( "" countercyclical provisioning "" ) . It would also be feasible to require minimum liquidity standards or impose an overall minimum ratio of capital to loans . This would be a sensible addition to the existing rules which apply lower capital requirements for less risky loans ( the "" Basel II "" rules ) . Rule changes like these are probably the main way in which governments will aim to influence banks , although they are unlikely to be adopted uniformly around the world . As a consequence , the regulatory environment will differ greatly from one country to the next . The impact of all this is likely to vary somewhat among banks and between countries . Of the large US and European banks that previously had large international investment banking operations , some seem to be evolving to focus mainly on domestic clients ; some are staying internationally orientated , but are adopting a significantly more conservative approach to risk ; while others , within the context of somewhat tighter regulations , seem likely to resume reasonably aggressive risk-taking . In the short term , this means reduced competition ( and thus greater opportunity for oligopoly profits ) for those that remain active in international investment banking . But new competitors are on the horizon . Some of the Asian banks , which are already strong and very large but domestic-focused , are likely to move to play a much larger role in intermediating capital flows at the global level . Thus , if we look ahead five years or so , the total number of major banks operating at scale on a truly global basis may be similar to that before the crisis , but these banks are likely to be more evenly spread around the world , with the US and Europe no longer so dominant . Moreover , they are likely to be accompanied by rapid growth in a number of second-tier banks in emerging markets around the world , active in intermediating flows into their fast-growing home markets . The dollar currently plays a central role in the world 's currency system in several key ways : It is the main currency for invoicing and settlement of international trade ; it is by far the largest component for the foreign exchange reserves of most sovereign states ; it is the unit to which many countries explicitly or in practice link their own currencies , at least in part ; its capital markets are still the deepest and most liquid in the world ; and it is the currency which many international investors use when monitoring their investment portfolios . But many investors have started to question this role , given that the financial crisis had its epicenter in the US financial markets , and given the focus this has brought to the debtor status of the US . The dollar 's central role dates back to the post-Second World War economic arrangements under the Bretton Woods agreement . In the 1970s , a central part of those arrangements ended , when the dollar 's link to gold was broken and many currencies moved from fixed to floating rates . For a while the dollar 's central role was in doubt , but there were several reasons why , in the end , it retained that position : The US was still a creditor nation ; the geopolitical power of the US was rising as the Soviet Union moved toward collapse ; and there was no serious alternative currency . Now , however , circumstances are very different . The US is the world 's largest debtor , and while this ensures a plentiful supply of dollar assets , it is a concern for investors that could ultimately threaten its credibility . In geopolitics , the US is still by far the world 's largest power , but the medium-term prospects for China , India and other nations are a clear pointer toward a multipolar world in coming decades . And an alternative currency satisfying some of the functions played by the dollar now exists , in the form of the euro . Foreign exchange reserves held in euros are rising , though still modest relative to those in dollars . The euro is now the major peg for the currency of a number of countries . Meanwhile , China 's renminbi has the potential to take on a similar role within perhaps one to two decades , assuming that China 's rapid economic development continues and that currency reform keeps pace . This is still far from being a creditable alternative at the moment , as the Chinese currency is not even freely convertible and domestic money markets are underdeveloped . None of this seems sufficient to unseat the dollar from its global financial role in a timeframe of a few years . But if we look forward ten years or so , it seems likely that the dollar will have lost its current pre-eminence , as the world becomes more multipolar in both politics and economics . One possibility is that the dollar , euro and renminbi form a kind of tripartite system , each with its own sphere of countries that tie their currencies to them more or less formally , each with a sphere for trade invoicing and settlement , and each playing a major role in foreign exchange reserves . A variant of this vision would see a key role for the IMF 's basket currency ( the SDR or Special Drawing Right ) updated to include emerging market currencies integrate the renminbi . In the aftermath of the credit crisis , the world is becoming multipolar , and this is likely to be clearly reflected in many aspects of the financial system . The dominant role of the dollar and of the US banks is set to give way to a world in which the US is still important , but in which other countries , their currencies , their capital markets and their banks , all play a greatly enhanced role . As with all great changes , this structural shift will offer both threats and opportunities for investors .",human
"reserve requirements and made credit lines directly available to the corporate sector . The rebound in economic activity will result from timely government reaction in an environment where the Brazilian financial system has proven very solid . This recovery was driven by a sound domestic market , in an environment where the labor market showed strong resilience in the first half of this year , with still increasing real wages and a small job creation . The recovery in developed countries from third quarter of 2009 onwards should help mitigate the contraction in the Brazilian economy and ensure that Brazil embarks on a strong growth cycle over the next few quarters . Brazil still is a relatively closed economy and it has a large home market . The government acted quickly and implemented successful countercyclical measures when credit conditions tightened and the economy signaled a slowdown . This blunted the impact of the financial crisis , and while the crisis was not insignificant , it did not hit Brazil particularly hard . The most important change in recent years has been the diversification of exports . This was not only reflected in increased exports to China - it was also reflected in foreign trade with many other emerging markets , including other Latin American countries . However , China is now clearly one of Brazil 's most important trading partners , and because it accounts for approximately 14 percent of Brazilian exports ( up from just 6 percent in 2005 ) China is just as important as the US . The increasing importance of China manifests itself in commodities , where demand is growing steadily and international prices are rising . Yes . The macroeconomic measures the government took were certainly correct to a large degree . It followed a fiscal surplus policy , continuously reducing its level of debt since 2003 . Furthermore , the government granted the central bank autonomy . Thus , Brazil was able to build up considerable foreign currency reserves following a policy of floating exchange rates with little intervention . As a result , the public sector was no longer exposed to the US dollar . Thanks to these measures , Brazil was able to benefit from favorable international developments , while simultaneously improving its own solvency indicators . Well , there has been progress over the last two years , but so far there has been no real breakthrough in institutional reforms . The government attempted to push through a tax reform , which is an extremely complex matter because of the complicated tax system in Brazil . The lack of consensus in Brazilian society regarding tax progression led the reform to falter . Nor was there any agreement with respect to labor and social security reforms . Yes , but these issues should not be underestimated , and the reforms must be taken up and implemented by the government and congress in the long term . This is the only way to ensure Brazil 's long-term competitiveness . The government has signaled that it wants to meet the schedule for these investments . However , the crisis will probably prevent all of the investments from being made on time . The government has extended its offer of credit for investments to soften the impact of the crisis . In principle , financing is now provided by the public sector , i.e. by state-owned banks . The tax burden of investments has also been reduced . As a result , the outlook for the infrastructure sector over the next few years is very favorable - irrespective of whether the government meets its investment goals or not . Brazil 's infrastructure is still not very highly developed and therefore has good prospects . The real estate sector is already experiencing strong growth thanks to lower interest rates , but I still see a lot of potential here . I also think agriculture and the biotech and alternative energy sectors are promising . For example , Brazil has a renewable energy program involving the use of ethanol in place of oil distillate that is being closely watched around the world . That 's right . The Brazilian banking system is one of the most solid in the world . Thanks to the measures taken by the central bank , we have not had any problems with domestic banks , which remained strongly capitalized and did not face material liquidity issues . Of course , this does not mean that Brazil has escaped the credit crisis unscathed , but only small and medium-sized banks , which are more dependent on wholesale and cross border financing , have been impacted . Credit Suisse maintained its strong position throughout the crisis because we took a number of measures to reduce risk and leverage and to diversify our earnings base . As a firm , we emerged from the crisis even better positioned than we were before . I think our clients and counterparts see it this way too - a number of private clients , corporate , and institutional clients look to Credit Suisse as their preferred partner , and this gives us tremendous opportunities . I would say the prospects in Brazil and elsewhere have never been better . Clearly , the opportunity to be the best and most admired bank in the world is within reach .",human
"down to earth and set fire to a pile of wood with his blazing cargo . But fire anyway found its way to earth - and most likely it was through a bolt of lightning . Without this provider of heat , our fore-fathers would have remained in the "" warm zones "" of the Earth and would never have been in a position to migrate northward . Nor would the melting of metal and the firing of clay have been possible . It was as early as 100 B.C. that the Greek physicist Heron of Alexandria described a form of propulsion which relied on steam as its source of energy . The decisive breakthrough , however , fell to Scottish engineer James Watt , who improved the steam engine design by English inventor Thomas Newcomen and had his own design patented in 1769 . Indeed , it was the serial manufacturing of steam engines that marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution . It was thanks to the use of steam power that locomotives could be built , a development that at a stroke changed the entire nature of human transportation and thereby had a decisive influence on the economy . Crude oil has been one of the most important suppliers of energy to human civilization ever since industrialization . Without the "" black gold , "" things just do n't work . The first ever crude oil refinery dates back to 1859 , when the American Edwin Drake extracted substantial quantities of oil from the ground via a drilling procedure . When the electric light bulb was introduced , oil initially lost its appeal . But when the automobile was invented , it reannounced itself with a vengeance , as this new form of transportation made gas ( for the Americans ) or petrol ( for the British ) a highly sought-after commodity . Ever since , it has been difficult to imagine living without this source of energy . More than a third of the world 's energy requirement is met by oil , making it the undisputed number-one energy commodity . Although oil is very practical and easy to use at its final point of consumption , be it for heating or for automotive refueling purposes , transporting it to the end consumer is not unproblematic . This is brought home to us time and again whenever an oil tanker accident makes the headlines . One of the greatest tanker catastrophes in Europe occurred on December 12 , 1999 , when the single-hulled tanker Erika , sailing under the Maltese flag with a cargo comprising 30,000 metric tons ( 33,069 tons ) of heavy oil , broke apart in heavy seas just off the coast of Brittany . As a result , 400 kilometers ( 249 miles ) of coastline were polluted and around 75,000 birds perished in the unforgiving oil slick . But on April 20 , 2010 , an event occurred that dwarfed the horror of any tanker accident . The Deepwater Horizon oil platform exploded following an uncontrolled oil leakage and sank promptly . The subsequent pollution in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the leaking of oil on the seabed at a depth of 1,500 meters ( 0.9 miles ) led to the worst environmental catastrophe of its type in the US . Following the accident , just under 10 million liters ( 63,000 barrels ) of oil is believed to have spewed out into the sea in the first three months alone . But as colossal as this oil pollution may sound , the oil spill of these first three months would cover precisely one hour of mankind 's current global oil requirement . Even though this oil spill dominated the headlines around the world for a long period of time , it would be a great mistake to believe that large amounts of oil are only released into the sea as a result of tanker accidents or spectacular disasters of the Deepwater Horizon type . The oil that leaks out in numerous places around the world due to ramshackle drill heads and leaky pipelines adds up to a quite staggering tonnage . A sad chapter in this respect is the history of oil drilling in the Niger delta . For the last 50 years , foreign multinationals have been busy extracting Nigerian oil in this area as it is extremely easy to refine . Experts estimate that approximately two billion liters of oil has so far flowed into the Niger delta as a result . Every year this leads to oil pollution on a par with the Exxon Valdez tanker accident . As a result of this notorious incident back in 1989 , in which 40,000 metric tons of oil was released into the sea , 2,000 kilometers of unspoiled regional coastline in Alaska was polluted . Together with wind power , hydropower is one of the oldest applied forms of energy . Back in antiquity , the Greeks and the Romans used water wheels for the milling of flour . In the Middle Ages , large water wheels made of wood were used to power machinery in mines , smithy workshops , sawmills , grinding factories and cloth-fulling mills . Hydropower also played a crucial role in the development of the first industrial towns of Europe and the US . The first hydropower stations for generating electricity were built in 1880 in Northumberland in the North of England . The techniques used in major hydroelectric power stations today may have been perfected , but conceptually they have changed little , with various types of turbines and generators still used to produce electricity . Around a quarter of the world 's entire supply of energy is generated through hydropower . Water is , after all , clean and natural . But the hunger for electricity leads to the building of ever-larger reservoirs and ever more productive power stations , which has its costs . Although we know far more nowadays about the consequences of major dams , they continue to be built on an ever-larger scale . For example , the Three Gorges Dam in China is one of the largest river dams anywhere in the world . Work on its construction began on December 14 , 1994 , with a workforce numbering up to 18 , 000 . The project involved the impoundment of the Yangtze river , and the body of the dam was finally completed on May 20 , 2006 . This resulted in the creation of a reservoir near the three gorges of Qutang , Wuxia , and Xiling . With a total length of 6,380 kilometers , the Yangtze river is the longest river in China and the third-longest in the world . This colossal project has inevitably led to the elimination of entire towns as well as countless villages , farms and factories . In total , just under two million people have to be relocated as part of the project . Nuclear power stations have played an important role in energy generation since the 1960s . The process of nuclear fission was first discovered in 1938 by the German chemists Otto Hahn und Friedrich Wilhelm Strassmann . The splitting of atoms leads to the release of heat energy that can then be converted into electrical energy by means of turbines and a generator . That process typically involves the fission of the radioactive heavy metal uranium , which is stored in the nuclear reactor 's fuel rods . One kilogram of uranium is enough to produce 350,000 kWh of electricity . This figure can vary a lot , as it depends on the degree of isotopic enrichment and the efficiency of the nuclear power station . By contrast , a kilogram of oil releases about 12 kWh and produces about 5 kWh . The proportion of global energy generation accounted for by nuclear power currently amounts to around 16 percent . Germany generates 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power , Switzerland 39 percent . Whereas in the early days of atomic energy nuclear power stations were seen as clean , efficient and cost-effective , this confidence was badly rocked by the reactor disaster at Chernobyl on April 26 , 1986 . Some 600,000 people were exposed to strong radioactive emissions as a result of this accident . The exact number of fatalities is not known even today , but is likely to have reached several thousands . Another major headache for nuclear power stations is the final disposal of the radioactive waste that poses a threat to mankind for almost an eternity . Plutonium-239 , for example , has a half-life of 24,110 years - in other words , its radioactive emissions only halve in potency once this period has elapsed . Without the power of wind in a ship 's sails , it is likely that the discovery of America would have had to wait a considerable while . Back in the early Middle Ages , people used wind energy to drive windmills , which were mainly used to grind grain . But whereas these windmills were ponderous small towers with cloth sails , today 's wind power machines are tall slender masts with three-bladed rotors . These convert wind energy into rotation energy , which is then used to produce electricity via a generator . In 2009 alone , new wind power facilities with a total capacity of 37,466 megawatts ( MW ) were installed around the world , of which 13,000 MW of capacity was installed in China , 9,922 MW in the United States , 2,459 MW in Spain , 1,917 MW in Germany and 1,271 MW in India . By the end of 2009 , total installed wind power capacity around the world amounted to more than 150,000 MW . The world 's annual energy requirement currently stands at around 107,000 terawatt hours ( one terawatt equals one billion watts ) , a figure that remains very much on the rise . Experts predict that energy consumption is likely to rise to around 160,500 terawatt hours per year by 2030 . Global energy needs will once again double to 321,000 terawatt hours per year by 2060 . The main drivers of this development are likely to be the emerging markets and developing countries , whose average standard of living will by then have risen to closely match that of Western industrialized nations . According to the latest data released by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , China 's energy consumption in 2009 actually exceeded that of the US by 4 percent . Since the beginning of the industrial era , human society has based the lion 's share of its working economy on the use of fossil energy sources . Given the latest state of our knowledge , experts believe that known reserves of crude oil will last for around 40 years , with uranium lasting for 50 years , natural gas for around 60 years and coal for a rather longer 220 years or so . The energy supply situation of mankind stands at a crossroads , and a number of far-reaching changes lie ahead . New discoveries and technological advances will bring about a number of targeted changes . But another likely scenario is that climate change and the dramatic growth in population - together with the corresponding increase in appetite for energy - will force a radical rethink . From today 's standpoint , two trends in particular appear to be emerging : on the one hand energy savings and more efficient usage , on the other tapping into alternative energy sources such as solar energy . The contribution to global electricity production made by photovoltaics may still be considerably below 1 percent , but its growth trajectory is steep nonetheless . Since 1988 , newly installed photovoltaic capacity has increased by an average of 35 percent annually . In 2009 alone , new photovoltaic installations were put in place around the world with a total capacity of some 5,000 MW . The fundamental question that arises , however , is whether a continual increase in energy consumption is desirable at all . Because as his energy consumption needs grow ever greater , man is interfering ever more in the workings of global ecosystems .",human
". Nowadays the Fed is run by a central government agency in Washington , known as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve . The seven members of the Board of Governors are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate . The full term of office is 14 years . The President also nominates the chairman of the Board of Governors . The chairman holds the second most powerful position in the US after the President , as the Fed controls all of the US dollars in circulation , and , as a result , influences international liquidity . The decisions made by the Fed therefore do not just affect monetary policy , but are also of great significance for the whole world in terms of power politics . The Fed chairman is also chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) . The FOMC holds eight meetings per year to discuss interest rate policy , and whether to raise or lower key interest rates . The Fed is responsible for ensuring the banking system remains intact , and maintaining a healthy economy . After each FOMC meeting , the chairman informs the public of the results . And the whole world is listening - for the last 18 years , brokers have hung on Alan Greenspan 's every word . On January 31 , 2006 , Alan Greenspan stepped down as Fed chairman . US President Bush described him as a legend who had taken control during his term of office as no other central banker in history had done . Moreover , Bush jokingly said that Greenspan was the only chairman of the Federal Reserve to ever achieve "" rock star status "" . In fact , Greenspan originally wanted to be a musician . He played the saxophone and clarinet , and dreamt of following in the footsteps of his idol , Benny Goodman . Part of Greenspan 's dream came true in any case , even without the instruments : fans and autograph hunters flock around him in droves whenever he appears in public . The Wall Street brokers who decorate their offices with his portraits call him the greatest Fed chairman of all time . Greenspan became head of the Federal Reserve in 1987 , at the ripe old age of 61 . Previously the economist worked as a private financial adviser . He held the post of chairman of the Federal Reserve under four US presidents . He always opposed the idea of monetary policy being bound by fixed rules . His description of monetary policy as "" an art form , not a science "" is still valid today . Greenspan became a legend partly thanks to his image as the second oracle of Delphi . He conveyed the results of the FOMC meetings in an almost cryptic manner , and once said of himself : "" If I turn out to be particularly clear , you 've probably misunderstood what I 've said "" . Greenspan hit the spot with his analyses and measures , which he supposedly often devised in the bathtub . As well as fascinating and influencing the US economy , they also had a great impact on financial systems all over the world . The German newspaper "" Die Zeit "" said that "" No Fed chairman before him had a better understanding of the investment banker 's psyche and was so devoted to cultivating it . No Fed chairman before him understood the economy with all its intricacies and pitfalls so clearly . "" Consequently , the US experienced a prolonged boom lasting almost a decade between 1992 and 2000 , the longest in American history . "" Ben Bernanke will replace a legend , "" said George W. Bush , when he named his economics adviser as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve . Ben Bernanke has been at the helm since February 1 , 2006 . Bernanke joined the Fed 's Board of Governors in 2002 , and just three years later , Bush appointed him as chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers in June 2005 . Unlike Greenspan , Bernanke is an academic who has never worked in the free market economy . According to Robert Perry , a former Fed Governor , Bernanke 's vast specialist knowledge means that nobody can hold a candle to him . For the time being though , it remains to be seen what tests and challenges Bernanke will face , and how he handles them . The only thing that is certain , however , according to the conservative American Enterprise Institute , is that the months ahead will hold great uncertainties . If Bernanke succeeds in steering the US economy between the pitfalls of strong inflation and a severe recession , he will also be able to build on the confidence of the markets and the economy .",human
"And if I really want complete peace , all I have to do is retreat into my home and unplug the telephone . Jakob Kuhn : When I coached the Swiss Under-21 team , the media were hardly bothered about us - we 'd get a couple of lines here and there at most . I said to my players : "" If we want people to start sitting up and taking notice , it 's up to us ! "" It was the same story with the national team . We wanted to get Switzerland fans and the whole country behind us , but I knew we 'd first need to earn this support . Our inner circle of players , coaches and backroom staff all had to pull together . But our friends at the Swiss Football Association - not to mention our main sponsor Credit Suisse - also contributed to football 's current popularity . Jakob Kuhn : No , I would n't say that . It 's naturally pleasing to receive recognition from your peers , but it would be disingenuous to claim that one award is better than the other . To do so would be disrespectful to the Swiss public who voted for me . They know as much about football as any other nation - even if they do n't always agree with my decisions . Jakob Kuhn : The journey to the stadium in Dortmund before the World Cup match against Togo was incredible . Tens of thousands of our fans turned up to greet us . It was like the Red Sea parting ! To have that many people cheering us on gave us a huge buzz - simply unforgettable . Jakob Kuhn : No , definitely not . There is a huge difference . The World Cup has always been a huge sporting event . But now it 's also become a huge spectacle . With the flood of media coverage we see today , you see with every step you take what it means to be at the World Cup . But I do n't see that as a negative . It 's a very good feeling that comes from within . Jakob Kuhn : No , never . It 's true that I was quick to become a coach after my retirement in 1977 . But both in Zurich , and from 1996 onward with the Swiss Football Association , I 've always worked with young players , something that 's always given me a good feeling . I never planned an independent career as a coach with ambitious goals such as the Champions League or the World Cup . Jakob Kuhn : Are you expecting me to name names ? No , there were no great surprises for me . I always try to assess the potential of a player . If you look at things this way , it 's more a question of being pleased to see confirmation of your expectations . From the team as a whole I always expect a strong performance - in the knowledge that this will not always manifest itself to the same degree , because we face a team that wants the same thing . But the desire always has to be there . And in 2006 this was the case . Each player wanted to give their all , all the time . In most cases this worked in our favor . Jakob Kuhn : I asked the Swiss Football Association to organize internationals against as many high-caliber teams as possible , and they 've fulfilled this request . Our ten-match schedule has been finalized , but we wo n't be announcing the names of any opponents until the relevant contracts have been signed . My job will be to try and get the best out of my players in these games . Our goal should always be to play perfect football . We should aim for nothing less . At the end of the day , it is results that count , but we want to provide attractive football and not deliberately go out to kill games . Jakob Kuhn : The game against Brazil was a special case . We wanted to use the opportunity to communicate certain information to the players in person . Sure , we ca n't take 30 players to EURO 2008 . We have to restrict ourselves to 23 . But you always have to be prepared for the unexpected . This might take the form of injuries , but on the positive side it may also be a case of players forcing their way into the squad on the strength of their performances . Jakob Kuhn : We 're currently in a phase where we want to meet with the players as often as possible . And it 's not just a question of me - there are other things that need monitoring and keeping an eye on , things that require the doctor and the physiotherapists , for example . The performance tests that we want to carry out are aimed at improving players . And although we rely on the tests of the different clubs , these are not always 100 % comparable . And so every three or four months we carry out our own assessments , so that we can eradicate any remaining deficits by the time EURO 2008 comes around . Jakob Kuhn : Until the final selection day comes , we cannot definitively finalize the squad . The door is always at least ajar , and I 'm thinking here of players like Pirmin Schwegler , Julian Esteban and Zdravko Kuzmanovich . And then even further down the age scale there are other talented players we are monitoring . As a rule that 's something I ca n't do personally , but we have a full staff of coaches nurturing this talent . The important thing is that I 'm informed every week of the latest developments at the different grounds around the country .

"Suisse global real estate analyst Zoltan Szelyes . "" We are expecting a soft landing in both markets . We do not expect prices to fall on average but rather a deceleration in price growth . "" Related Link : Credit Suisse Research The US has experienced a construction boom in the last five years that appears to have overreached itself , particularly in states such as Florida , Arizona , Nevada and Washington DC . The surge was sparked in 2001 by low supply , robust growth in employment , an expansionist monetary policy and a trend for many households to redirect investments away from stock markets into housing . By the end of July of this year sales volumes of newly constructed and existing houses were down 22 percent and 11 percent respectively year-on-year . Median house prices in August were hovering at roughly last year 's levels after double-digit growth in 2004 . Socio-demographic developments in the UK have helped keep residential housing prices buoyant for several years . Between 1996 and the end of 2004 cumulative prices rose by 260 perce nt and have revived again this year despite a slowdown in 2005 . Strong continued migration has boosted demand while the number of persons per household has decreased from 2.8 in the 1970s to 2.3 , with the number of one-person households increasing from 27 percent to 31 percent . The boom years seem surely at an end in both countries , but Szelyes does not believe that a cooling of residential property prices will necessarily drag down the rest of the economy . "" The effect real estate has on consumption is mostly overestimated . The most important effect is income dynamics and employment growth should still remain steady next year , "" he said . On the other side of the coin , there are plenty of commercial property investment opportunities if you know where to look . Yields in some parts of the world have now dropped below bond yields , a factor that demands a certain amount of shopping around . But many markets in Asia , Eastern Europe and a reviving western European still offer potential for rewards . "" We see huge potential in Singapore and Tokyo where markets are at their most bullish and office rents should rise in Hong Kong due to low supply and a robust demand , "" said Szelyes . "" High immigration is also supporting retail sales in Australia where we view shopping centres as attractive ventures . "" The office property markets in German , Swedish , French , Spanish and British cities are also showing signs of revival . The comparatively limited supply of commercial property combined with strong economic growth has accelerated the real estate market in Eastern Europe . However , Szelyes advises caution in some of the more economically volatile countries such as Hungary in favour of Poland and the Czech Republic . "" Market selection is extremely important in Eastern Europe . Of the potential new European Union member countries , Romania and Bulgaria appear to harbour greater dynamics and higher yields on the real estate market , "" he said . Since the mid-1990s , real estate investments have developed into a highly regarded asset class . Alongside conventional direct investments , there are a variety of indirect investment opportunities that eliminate potential disadvantages such as low liquidity and lack of transparency . Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) structures are one of the most popular options that have been gaining in popularity in the last 12 years . REITS were created by a 1960 US act of Congress and are designed to allow small investors to participate in the equity ownership of real estate . REITs are not allowed to invest in riskier development projects and distribute tax-exempt profits to shareholders . REITS have now spread all over the world - combined market capitalisation has grown more than five times since 1994 - and will be introduced in the UK next year . The recent 36 billion dollar buy-out of Equity Office Properties Trust , the largest owner of office buildings in the US , by Blackstone Group demonstrates the popularity and potential of REITS at present .",human
"already holds 32 percent of global household wealth , and we 're likely to see this share of the pie growing rapidly . "" The discussions at the fourth meeting of the Credit Suisse Research Institute were based on the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report , which was published in early October 2010 . While Forbes and other magazines limit their focus to "" rich lists , "" the Global Wealth Report examined the development of household wealth over the last 10 years in more than 200 countries . "" This is the first report that looks at the wealth of all of the world 's 4.4 billion adults . It looks in detail at the composition of all assets of all households in the world , "" states Michael O'Sullivan , Head of UK Research and Asset Allocation , who is one of the authors responsible for the report . The Global Wealth Report also looks at social structures that influence wealth distribution and takes account of demographical changes , gender issues , and urbanization trends . One of the interesting features in the Global Wealth Report is the wealth pyramid . "" There are 1 billion adults in the middle segment of the pyramid , holding wealth between USD 10,000 and USD 100,000 , "" Giles Keating points out . "" That is an enormous opportunity in terms of growing consumer markets . "" Finding these opportunities in the near term while looking at long-term opportunities at the same time , was the aim of this meeting . "" We 're looking at mid-range and some upper-end products that we believe people across the Asian markets , Latin America , and countries like Turkey or Indonesia will want to consume . "" The Research Institute expects the spending power of adults in the middle of the wealth pyramid to grow as their wealth and income rise . "" This is an opportunity for companies in those countries as well as for multinational companies in Europe and America . "" While leading markets such as the US , Europe and Japan had to struggle through the financial crisis , emerging markets like China and India simply reacted to the outside shocks . David Mulford , former US Ambassador to India , sees major potential in the Indian market : "" You have to remember that India is not very export dependent . It has a huge internal private sector , and 60 percent of its population is under 30 years old . "" This group , he is convinced , is going to be a dynamic economic driver . Asia expert Urs Schoettli sees the background of the Asian dynamism in recent political developments : "" Chinese who are 40 years or younger , for example , are the first generation that has not witnessed or feared a political crisis such as war or revolution . It is the first post-war generation , and they are more interested in prestige and consumption than in saving for difficult times . "" Besides being the first consumer generation , many young people in the emerging economies are among the first in their families to pursue a higher education and earn a good salary . Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Sir John Major , asserts : "" Young Europeans will have to recognize that the competition from Latin America and Asia is going to be intense . Young people in these countries are determined to succeed . They look back on the chasm of poverty they were able to escape , and they have no desire to fall back into it . """,human
"invest up to 750 million dollars in the project . Satellite internet is also on the drawing board in Paris . Under the "" Digital France 2012 "" initiative , every French household will get access to the internet by 2012 - even at locations where there is no cable connection . With its Tooway™ internet service , Eutelset intends to play a key role in the project . Europe 's second-largest satellite operator this year began to invest in a new satellite infrastructure for the whole of Europe - a project designed to bring satellite internet quality up to the standards of the terrestrial cable network . In Switzerland , Swisscom announced at the start of the year that it was intending to offer this service in future as a complement to its DSL-based broadband solutions . The move could enable the firm to meet its statutory requirement of delivering a basic service to all parts of the country by 2017 , including the mountainous regions . To date , satellite service operators have made most of their money from offering TV and video-on-demand . Growth has been driven by the rapid rise of new payTV broadcasters , particularly in the emerging markets , together with the expanding spectrum of TV channels and increasing demand for superior transmission quality ( high-definition TV ) . The main buyers of the transmission capacity provided by the satellite operators are media and television companies , the public sector ( the military , for instance ) , but also companies from the telecommunications sector - where the trend is increasing . Since July last year , for instance , SES - Europe 's biggest satellite operator - has had success in offering its IP-Prime product to telecom firms in the US . This delivers a low-cost feed comprising TV , payTV and music channels to the telecom service providers ' IPTV platforms ( TV via internet protocol ) . Europe 's satellite duopoly ( Eutelsat and SES ) have similar plans for Europe , too , using their own products ( KA-SAT , ASTRA2Connect ) . The two companies envision a potential market of 15-30 million households , which the telecoms firms could serve more competitively and with superior quality using satellite internet rather than their copper-wire network . The ASTRA2Connect product that SES has been offering for about a year now is growing by 10,000 connnections a month following initial teething troubles . But with estimated annual revenues of 35 million euros from 2010 , this service is likely to remain something of a niche - in particular given that the potential internet customer has to bear relatively high equipment costs ( satellite key , encoder , etc. ) . The telecom service providers ' interest in satellite-based internet services extends much further , however . The use of satellites is unlocking attractive , cost-efficient opportunities for mobile telephony services in particular . Telecoms companies have to date offered mobile internet and television via their UMTS networks , which requires a lot of bandwith and is therefore still relatively expensive for the end-consumer . In future , though , TV , internet , video and music content could be fed into terrestrial DVB-H or DVB-SH networks digitally via satellite and transmitted to the end-consumer 's mobile device on a competitive basis . The particular attraction of this is that services can be combined with navigational and locational information ( GPS ) , thus opening up a broad spectrum of new services . Back in 2006 , Europe 's SES and Eutelsat satellite duopoly founded Solaris - a joint venture designed to offer this type of transmission service to telecom firms . The necessary frequencies are to be awarded in spring 2009 , opening up new perspectives for satellite operators . Satellite operators are likely to perform relatively well in a deteriorating economic environment . Very long-term customer agreements make future income streams relatively transparent . There is no overcapacity , and demand far outstrips supply . While this is a capital-intensive industry and debt levels are relatively high , refinancing is consequently secured over the long term and there is substantial scope for passing on price increases . The sector is therefore seen as a relatively defensive investment , with the market not yet fully recognizing the prospects outlined .",human
"over a 10 kilometer stretch . The technology of Omnisens , based in Morges , Switzerland , enables energy suppliers to record and analyze any accidental or intentional malfunctions . Together with various partners , the company monitors civil engineering structures such as bridges , railways , roads , and dams . The list of potential applications is long , as the proper functioning of numerous structures is vital for the economy , the environment , and society . Marc Niklès is from a Neuchâtel family closely associated with the watch industry , which certainly facilitated his approach to micro technology . In 1997 , he submitted his thesis on fiber optics to the EPFL ( Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne ) . At that stage , he was already considering how fiber optics could be used as sensors . A first prototype was developed that was able to identify points of overheating , which is a sure indication of various anomalies . The invention was initially used for electricity cables and gas pipelines , and these remain the core business of Omnisens although applications in related fields are being developed . On December 31 , 1999 , as others waited for the millennium bug announced for midnight , Marc Niklès and three other founders launched Omnisens . Initially based in the center of the EPFL science park , the company brought its first product to the market in 2002 . Over the years , it has built solid foundations with qualified employees , comprehensive expertise , and highly specialized know-how . Today , Omnisens SA has around two dozen employees , including four specialists with doctorates in fiber optics . Despite the move to Morges , the link with EPFL is still strong , mainly thanks to a series of projects funded by the CTI ( Commission for Technology and Innovation ) . In 2006 the company changed its strategy . The focus is no longer on producing measuring instruments , but on the overall monitoring of critical structures in the energy sector . Many clients are looking for turnkey solutions . Fiber optic sensors require installation and maintenance , the data recorded needs analyzing , and employees need training . Omnisens provides all of these services . The entry of a venture capitalist in 2008 contributed to the implementation of this reorientation . The new strategy is also reflected in the new company motto "" Securing Asset Integrity , "" which replaces "" Defining Performance . "" The company is now also awarded larger contracts . Omnisens has clients located around the world , who are aware of the serious consequences of a defect in a power cable , pipeline , or offshore structure . In Latin America , for example , pipelines have to cross the Andes , where landslides are a real threat . In Siberia and the far east of Russia , the subsoil is increasingly unstable due to thawing of the permafrost . In the North Sea , the challenge is to maintain pipelines at a constant temperature to prevent petroleum from freezing . In Alaska , Omnisens technology has most likely already contributed to preventing damage to a pipeline . This was laid in a trench dug out of the ice , and as the temperature of the environment rose , the pipeline was exposed to meltwater . The system sounded the alarm , and the petroleum was prevented from thickening too much . With the aid of the system , the exact location of the problem could be identified . The world 's largest wind farm is located off the coast of Great Britain . The submarine power cables transferring the electricity to shore are monitored by Omnisens systems , as is a 32 kilometer long subsea interconnector linking Guangdong to Hainan Island , a popular resort destination in China . The large infrastructure projects Omnisens participates in have long development phases . The company has dedicated , specialized employees who are following the projects and developing new applications for the technology to meet the requirements for safe and efficient monitoring of the projects under construction . In the future , Omnisens also aims to operate in the area of monitoring for the latest generation of long submarine power cables and infrastructure used for the extraction of deep-sea oil and gas . Omnisens SA is in permanent competition for market share with large international groups . However , the specialists from the canton of Vaud are not put off by this and concentrate on their most important competitive advantage : Today , they are the only provider able to record data over a distance of over 100 kilometers from a single interrogator . The company is highly valued by its clients , not only for its technology , but also for the way it supports clients to find a monitoring solution for their plant , which requires more than just clever technology . The manageable size of the company means it can react with great flexibility , adapting its services to best match its clients ' requirements . The black box , which collects data , is installed at the company 's headquarters , guaranteeing Swiss quality work . The tragic events in Japan have provided a painful reminder of the dangers to the whole economy , the environment , and society . Everyone wants operators to manage these risks better . Moreover , this is still new technology and plans for monitoring installations are often limited . Although there is a long way to go in improving safety , Omnisens has a promising future thanks to its integrated approach .",human

They could send cash with a neighbor or a bus driver who happened to be driving through their village . Or they could send a postal money order , but that could take weeks , often failed to arrive , and in any case was possible only if the recipient had a post office box . This was about as unlikely as having a bank account . At the time , in 2007 , several million Kenyans owned a cell phone with a Safaricom number . Then this phone number essentially became a virtual bank account number . Starting in March of that year , Safaricom customers could upload money to their cell phone and send it to other Safaricom customers . It arrived within minutes , and the recipient was informed with a text message . The money could be forwarded or received as cash from an M-Pesa agent . Two weeks after introducing the service , Safaricom had nearly 20,000 active M-Pesa users . After seven months , there were one million . Today , 20 million customers in Kenya are registered . More than 83,000 agents in cities and rural areas assist customers in uploading , sending and receiving money . Rural Kenyans with no banking options leaped from the agricultural age straight into the digital tomorrow . And transferring money from one cell phone to another was only the start . Today , users can pay their electricity and water bills , get cash from an ATM , buy airline tickets , add phone time , buy concert tickets , pay the taxi driver or butcher and take out a small loan , perhaps to purchase a solar panel that brings electricity to their home for the first time . Not least , M-Pesa encourages saving . In cooperation with Safaricom , the Commercial Bank of Africa offers savings accounts , paying 2 percent interest for amounts up to the equivalent of 100 Swiss francs . Accounts equivalent to more than 500 Swiss francs even earn 5 percent . Many people are earning interest for the first time in their lives . It is no exaggeration to say that Kenya 's economy depends on M-Pesa . According to the Central Bank of Kenya , the value of all transactions between June 2013 and June 2014 represented 39 percent of the country 's GDP . M-Pesa moves more than one billion Swiss francs per year , and in fiscal year 2014 it earned the parent company 268 million francs , an increase of 21.6 percent over the previous year . This success is swiftly going global . M-Pesa has already been introduced in Tanzania , Egypt , Afghanistan and India , with Uganda , Zambia , Mozambique , Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo soon to follow . The system has even arrived on the "" old continent ; "" in April of 2014 , Vodafone exported M-Pesa to Romania - as a test market for Europe . Safaricom estimates the user rate there as "" in the hundreds of thousands , "" without volunteering details . Vodafone , a British firm , owns 40 percent of Safaricom , and the Kenyan government owns 35 percent . As a strategy for the future , the company envisions cashless transactions for business customers as well . "" I never go to the bank anymore , "" declares Billy Warero . The 32-year-old works at a telecommunications company in Nairobi . Electric bill , cable TV , rent , online purchases and supermarket shopping - he does it all with M-Pesa . His paycheck still goes to his bank account , but he can also transfer that to his M-Pesa account using his cell phone . Even so , the banks are among the winners of this revolution . It took them a while to recognize the new business opportunities it afforded . At first , they fought the competition . Now they have come on board . After all , it is the banks that allow people to transfer money to an M-Pesa account , and the system 's savings and loan functions would also be impossible without the banks .",human
"to reach 9 billion by 2050 , the prevailing financial crises , growing inequalities , rising carbon emissions and degraded natural ecosystems , the global consensus is that humanity 's footprint is on the edge of its ecological boundaries . As the planet has undergone such dramatic transition over the last two decades , the need for significant changes in the approach to sustainable economic development has never been as pressing . There is no doubt that internationally binding rules would help pave the path to a green economy , yet the overall expectations are that treaties leading to international law are off the table at Rio . In the absence of a global governance framework , the need for a collective interplay between governments , business , scientists , politicians and the world 's population could hardly be more pertinent . Clear perspectives on government policies and long-term incentives are necessary for corporations to play their role in becoming a part of the solution and taking leadership in advancing a green economy . At the urging of politicians , regulators and shareholders and in the light of the global financial crises and recent natural catastrophes , there is an upward trend in corporations adopting and scaling up their sustainable business practices . For more than ten years , Credit Suisse 's focus on environmental and social considerations has been a critical aspect of our business . Our ISO 14001-certified environmental management system helps us to make more efficient use of resources throughout the company and to reduce the environmental impacts of our activities , resulting in a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions . Our Green Business Initiative brings together experts from across the bank to promote renewable energy and cleantech products and services , while our internal risk review process routinely accesses transactions with clients that could pose environmental or social risks in accordance with our own policies and guidelines for sensitive industries . Sustainable investing , and a solid understanding of sustainability-related investment risk should be part of every investment decision and investment process . On the eve of Rio+ 20 , Credit Suisse further attested its commitment to following the path to the green economy with the launch of the ' Sustainability Outlook on Rio+ 20 - Expected Impacts on the Economic System ' report . Exploring the seven key cross-cutting themes identified for Rio+ 20 - among them featuring sustainable water , food security , agriculture and oceans - the report provides readers with advice on politically-induced growth potential in these areas , as well as giving an insight into the potential long-term implications of the summit on broader market developments . It explores likely scenarios for the funding of sustainable development policies and newer unconventional models of funding , such as impact investing , highlighting the fact that any mobilization of funding must be aligned with global economic recovery . One approach could involve the lifting of subsidies and tariffs that hinder investments and market potential . The report also refers to the Rio+ 20 agenda item on increased disclosure through participation of private companies in voluntary sustainability reporting schemes , which has the potential to translate into a policy option . Credit Suisse is further acknowledging its commitment to sustainable development at Rio+ 20 on the subject of threatened biodiversity . Credit Suisse will be an endorser of the "" Private Sector Communiqué on Natural Capital "" , the private sector initiative conveying a shared commitment to improving how the corporate sector values natural capital in its planning and decisions . John Tobin , Head Sustainability Affairs Credit Suisse , says : "" Negative impacts on the Earth 's natural assets such as soil , forests , air , and water - and the services provided by them - not only have environmental and social implications . They are also likely to impact the global economy and in time will be felt by our shareholders , clients , employees , and other stakeholders , because we need a healthy planet if we are going to sustain a healthy economy in the long term . "" Also set for launch this Wednesday by the World Bank Group , the global "" 50:50 "" initiative will bring together at least 50 public and 50 private sector institutions in formulating their joint support for factoring natural capital into decision making . While it remains to be seen what other tangible measures will surface out of Rio over the next few days , and factoring in the inevitable yet familiar dynamics of patchy progress and setbacks akin to international conventions of its kind , the question is no longer whether or not the world is heading towards a green economy , but rather , how to get there . Just as the Earth Summit 1992 was hailed as the event that set the blueprint for sustainable development for the 21st Century , there is still hope that Rio+ 20 could indeed turn out to be the event that transformed the mission of such gatherings from international global declarations and high-level treaties to bottom-up , ambitious , catalyzing and meaningful action by local governments and businesses on the ground .",human
"that is what provides access to the labor market . At the same time , the way companies conduct themselves when they streamline is important and , conversely , how many new jobs they create . Another big question for me concerns unemployment , illness , disability and retirement : How can we ensure that people are able to sustain themselves in these situations ? Bigler : It 's very hard when people lose their jobs . Their entire life concept is called into question . The threat of this scenario probably plays a major role in people 's personal views . Rossini : Perhaps it is because of the higher unemployment rate in French-speaking Switzerland , which increases the feeling of competition with foreign workers . But you also have to remember that the French-speaking Swiss clearly voted "" no "" in the referendum on mass immigration in greater numbers than German-speaking Swiss did . Bigler : From a governmental policy perspective , we would do well to carry on with Switzerland 's humanitarian tradition . However , there are some fears among the population that we must take seriously . One difficult question is the distinction between true refugees and economic refugees . More consistent enforcement of asylum laws seems to me to be an important approach . Rossini : For me , the priorities are different . In our society , which is strongly influenced by individualism , living together has become a big challenge . In order to continue the Swiss humanitarian tradition , we need to better inform and enlighten . We need a culture of openness and solidarity . Only in this way can we prevent our society from becoming mired in self-interest . Rossini : Globalization and the high level of mobility among the population offer one explanation for a certain shifting in the direction of a national identity . But it 's important to see things in a nuanced manner , because there is another level of identity that has not lost its importance : the cantonal level . Federalism is and will continue to be a pillar of national solidarity for both the population and for the authorities . Rossini : In the past , the left was often viewed by conservatives as unpatriotic because they represented values such as openness and social justice . This was wrong . As you can see from the results of the Worry Barometer , this is a patent falsehood on the part of the right . Bigler : Let me offer you another explanation for the national pride : In light of the financial crisis , which affected all of Europe except for Switzerland , the view that we have a truly successful model has taken hold among the populace . Everyone benefits from this and it strengthens identification with the homeland . We can be proud of our country ! Rossini : Defending Switzerland means taking part in the international discussion and playing an active role in shaping the rules of the game . An isolated Switzerland cannot go on the offensive . We 're wealthy , but small . As a result , we need others in all areas : education , research , the economy . Beyond simply defending our interests , we also have to play an open and responsible part in global affairs . Bigler : The Federal Council , in particular , must step up to the challenge . It should be more assertive in dealing with other countries when it comes to vigorously representing our interests . Bigler : The Swiss electorate opposed mass immigration , and now Switzerland must implement this new constitutional provision . At the same time , we cannot jeopardize the bilateral agreements with the EU . Rossini : On this point , I agree ! The bilateral path is currently the only possible option ; that 's why the Federal Council is actively engaged in strengthening the bilateral process . However , we in Switzerland also have to recognize that the EU has its own basic rules and principles , which it legitimately defends - specifically , free movement of people . Bigler : We should leave the Federal Council in peace as it conducts these difficult negotiations . The constant influx of new proposed solutions is definitely not constructive . Rossini : Optimism has always been an excellent indicator . It is the engine of both individual and collective commitment . It influences innovation and creativity . It is an important stability factor . Political and economic stakeholders have a responsibility not to foment fear . They should not take positions or express opinions that question the social progress of the public sector . Bigler : A strong economy is not guaranteed . We must take account of economic and political conditions , as well as our locational advantages . Initiatives , such as the one to abolish lump-sum taxation , could lead to millions in lost taxes and call into question the solidarity between urban and rural voters . But the call by the left for an inheritance tax also threatens jobs in the SME sector significantly because it jeopardizes solutions for succession . Bigler : My focus is on how we live together on a daily basis within our families and in the surrounding community . Mutual support and a willingness to help one another lead to a better quality of life , greater contentment and social balance without the need for unwanted government intrusion . Rossini : Respect , tolerance and solidarity are the key qualities and values for ensuring social cohesion and the prosperity of the country . These are the success factors for living together , for prosperity ... and for our happiness !",human
"began to take market share from CDs , the impractical vinyl format seemed destined to become a relic , if not actually extinct . Yet fast forward to 2014 , and one can walk into a major media entertainment store and be greeted by signs boasting "" We Carry Vinyl ! "" The LP , in other words , is in the midst of an unlikely comeback . Bucking the trend towards technologically driven music consumption , vinyl has posted eight consecutive years of sales growth in the US , and sales were up 46 percent in the first eight months of 2014 compared to last year , according to Nielsen SoundScan , compared to a 19 percent decline in CD sales . And as of August , Jack White 's new album "" Lazaretto "" became the best-selling vinyl record since Pearl Jam 's "" Vitalogy "" in 1994 , selling a total of 67,000 vinyl copies , a full 25 percent of its total US sales . All that said , at just 6.5 percent the size of the CD market - the actual number of LPs sold through August just 5.6 million - the vinyl market remains much too small to come close to offsetting the music industry 's well-documented woes . Even digital sales are down . Online purchases of music fell for the first time ever in 2013 in the face of a sharp increase in streaming sales , and have fallen 13 percent this year through August , according to Nielsen . Which brings us to the irony of it all : vinyl - poor , beleaguered vinyl - has become a crucial and unexpected ally for artists and retailers looking to boost revenue in a challenging market . Thanks in large part to LPs , independent record stores - the likes of Brooklyn 's Permanent Records and San Francisco 's Amoeba Music - are no longer hanging on for dear life like they were when the CD fell out of favor , says to David Bakula , a senior vice president at Nielsen . Indeed , he says , indie music stores are selling about two-thirds of total vinyl in the US LP sales have also gotten a huge boost from Record Store Day , an annual event music stores use to celebrate vinyl , promote themselves , and put out special releases . Not to be left out , larger stores such as f.y . e . are pushing vinyl , and big box retailer Target is selling turntables . Artists are helping push vinyl too , and for reasons other than nostalgia . Bands can charge more for a physical record than a digital sale , and they can also link vinyl sales with special releases and promotions that stimulate the fan base . The vinyl market is n't even relying only on classic rock bands that became famous when LPs were king . Top sellers this year include the Arctic Monkeys , Beck , The Black Keys and Lana Del Rey . Nearly every major label is putting out a vinyl version of new releases , something that has n't happened since the 90s . In the final analysis , though , it 's consumers that are driving the trend . Audiophiles finally seem to have gotten their message through to others that the vinyl offers an undeniably richer sound than the data-compressed audio formats used in today 's portable music players , such as mp3 and m4a . And mainstream music buyers also seem to want some of the old pleasures of owning a record collection back again , including the enjoyment of artistic album packaging , which gets lost when streaming or purchasing from iTunes . "" People are once again engaged not just in the medium but also the content and the packaging , "" says Bakula . "" And nothing beats the sound of vinyl . "" This article has originally appeard in The Financialist .",human
"fewer good left-backs . That I remained uninjured and was able to play in every championship match with Wolfsburg . Health is the most important thing for a footballer . That we missed qualifying for the Champions League by a single point . And , of course , the defeat against Argentina with the Swiss national team in the round of sixteen at the World Cup . We should have played better , and it bothers me . I certainly showed my stuff in Brazil , but I am never entirely satisfied with myself . Maybe I was n't all that bad - but I could have done better : played to a higher standard , gone on the offensive more often . Yes , I get nervous before every match . But , as soon as I make my first pass , the nervousness goes away . I am a laid-back person . On the football pitch , I know what my job is , and I know what I can do . And what I ca n't do , I do n't do . On the contrary . I did a lot of stupid stuff at school . I often got kicked out of class , and my parents were often summoned by the teacher . Today , though I am quiet in public , privately I always enjoy a good joke , and I tell people in no uncertain terms what I think . No. I only remember that I started playing for FC Schwamendingen at age six , and we had an unbeatable team that won almost every tournament . I played defense in the rear , and my older brother Roberto scored the goals up front . Talk ( laughs ) . On the field , however , they are different from me . They both play on offense . Roberto is the fastest of us , and Francisco has a great eye . We were street children . Football was all we had . Our parents did n't have a lot of money , but there was always enough to buy a ball . I support my parents now . They will never have to go without ; I will see to that . When I was 11 or 12 . I knew school was n't for me and that I had to do everything in my power to earn a living by playing football someday . I was taking quite a risk . After finishing compulsory education , I did n't go into vocational training but concentrated on football . Thankfully , my gamble paid off . No. The title was nice but not that important . More important to me was when they told me even before the championship that I would get to train with FCZ 's first team after the tournament . That was my big chance to show what I could do . Angel Di Maria of Real Madrid , Jefferson Farfan of Schalke 04 , and , of course , Arjen Robben of Bayern Munich . You ca n't let him out of your sight for even a second . Otherwise , he 's gone . He reacts to your movements . As soon as you attack , he does a hook , and another , and another - and suddenly he 's gone . But I enjoy playing against such accomplished footballers . Afterwards , I know where I stand . No. I show healthy aggression on the field . But when you play smart defense , it works without committing any rough fouls - usually . My manager told me over the phone . I was so happy , I invited my family to dinner that same evening . Our opponent was Wales , and after Reto Ziegler received a red card , I even got to play . Since that time , I have been on the starting lineup . Not really , no . Our practices are shorter but more intensive . We talk more about tactics , and he calls for a more offensive strategy . He also places tremendous importance on team spirit . With Hitzfeld as coach , we had our meals at tables for eight . With Petkovic , we all eat at one long dining table . Practice , practice , practice . Never give up , and always believe you can do it , even if others are more talented . Someday , I want to play for a major club in Spain or England . And with the Swiss national team , we want to go to the 2016 European Championship in France and get as far as possible . We have the skills to do that .",human
"President Cristina Kirchner 's government is merely alleviating the symptoms of the country 's economic malaise , rather than addressing the root causes , according to a report by Credit Suisse analysts Casey Reckman and Daniel Chodos entitled , "" Argentina : An Unsteady State . "" Put simply , the government is n't tightening fiscal policy enough to tame the out-of-control inflation that is the country 's primary problem . And the heavy public spending and subsidies fueling the rise in consumer prices will soon put Argentina right back where it started . By year-end , say the analysts , the country will likely have to go through a second , larger devaluation . "" Argentina 's current economic situation is unsustainable , "" the analysts say . "" The government 's approach … still seems improvised and uncoordinated , which undermines its attempts to anchor expectations and restore confidence . Moreover , it has targeted the decline in reserves and other distortions that are symptoms of Argentina 's economic issues rather than addressing the underlying causes . "" That 's because government policy is what triggered the decline in foreign reserves - and not the other way around . The expropriation of private company assets - such as the 2012 seizure of Spanish oil company Repsol 's operations in the country - has dampened foreign investment . Making matters worse , the country has been locked out of international debt markets since its 2001 default , forcing it to use foreign reserves to fund imports and repay debt issued before it lost market access . Reserves dropped more than 12 billion US dollars to 30.6 billion US dollars in 2013 after sitting at more than 52 billion US dollars as recently as 2010 . And Credit Suisse thinks they will continue to plummet , to 22.1 billion US dollars this year and 15.7 billion US dollars in 2015 . That said , the government 's January 22 and 23 devaluation was a move in the right direction . Combined with efforts to tighten monetary conditions through higher interest rates , the markdown of the peso is likely to "" provide temporary relief for the peso and international reserves "" until exports from the grains and oilseeds harvest starts bringing more dollars into the economy in March or April , according to another Credit Suisse report entitled "" Argentina : Bandaged , But Not Cured . "" The South American nation also relaxed restrictions on individuals purchasing dollars for savings purposes . Because Argentina tightly controls currency exchange as a way of supporting the peso and reducing capital flight , a black market for dollars has arisen in which the peso is 35 percent weaker than the official rate . Anecdotal evidence suggests that dollar outflows are even more restricted since the devaluation , which should increase pressure on the parallel exchange rate and further help slow the evaporation of reserves . The government will also seek to tamp down inflation by keeping wage increases to a minimum when it begins negotiations with labor unions in March . Still , these are Band-Aids and not the necessary surgery . Dollar inflows will begin to slow as the harvest subsides around August , at which point inflation "" could erode the benefits of January 's devaluation in no more than six months ' time , "" Reckman and Chodos said . Indeed , the government reported consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in January compared with the previous month . Credit Suisse thinks inflation could reach 40 percent this year , up from 28.4 percent last year . And that 's why Credit Suisse is currently expecting reserves to dip below 25 billion US dollars by year-end , which could necessitate a fourth quarter devaluation of 30 percent . "" [ That ] second adjustment could be an even riskier and more disruptive undertaking than the most recent one , "" Reckman and Chodos said . "" It would produce another inflationary shock and … could quickly lead to heightened social and political tensions . "" How so ? Just consider what the effect of another devaluation is likely to be on the real economy . It would prompt continued inflation , which would spur policymakers to raise interest rates again . Naturally , both of those things would tend to make consumers a little queasier about spending and further spook domestic investors . As a result , the economy may contract 0.5 percent next year , according to Credit Suisse . Economic indicators already look sickly , too . Credit Suisse projects a contraction in GDP of 0.3 percent for this year . Consumer confidence fell to 33.5 in February from 43.7 in January - the fourth consecutive monthly decline - according to a survey by Di Tella University in Buenos Aires . The indicator is currently at its lowest level since September 2002 . But it is in 2015 that the true nightmare scenario could take shape , as falling reserves increase the risk that Argentina wo n't be able to pay its creditors - again . While Argentina 's debt is manageable this year , bonds maturing next year will increase the country 's foreign-currency 2015 debt service costs to 12.5 billion US dollars . That figure , which includes both interest payments and repayment of maturing bonds , amounts to 56.4 percent of Credit Suisse 's end-2014 forecast for foreign reserves . "" This makes the outlook for dollar debt service look more worrisome , "" Reckman and Chodos said . Amid the turbulence , officials are reassuring the population that they have the situation under control . "" The government is the one that can best defend the Argentine people 's moral integrity , their pocketbooks , their past and their future , "" Kirchner 's cabinet chief Jorge Capitanich said several days after the devaluation , according to Argentine newspaper La Nacion . They 've got their work cut out for them if they want to prove it .",human
". In addition , the European Parliament recently asked the Commission to comment by the end of 2006 on the ability of the EU to accept new members , including the EU 's geographical limits . The EU 's ability to act is to be improved by a reform of its institutions . New instruments of this type would have been provided for in the EU Constitutional Treaty , but the future of this document is more than uncertain . It is indisputable that as the Union increases in size , it will become harder for it to take decisions in the foreign policy arena in particular . This makes it all the more important for the EU to provide itself with the right decision-making mechanisms . This process is currently under way . There is an ambivalent attitude toward the EU . When the EU is strong , it is perceived as a threat by some of our fellow citizens . I consider this view to be incorrect , since we should not forget that the EU consists exclusively of democracies and market economies and that its decisions do not fundamentally conflict with our system of values . As a partner in a bilateral relationship , we need the EU to be able to act . Only then will we be able to find solutions to our problems and concerns within a reasonable period . Switzerland 's solidarity in helping to reduce the social and economic inequalities in the enlarged EU is proof of the Swiss Federal Council 's awareness of the great importance of the most recent enlargement of the EU for the security and prosperity of Europe . We want to make our contribution to the successful integration of these new , growing markets of eastern Europe , since this will also be to Switzerland 's benefit . Anyone who works closely with the EU has a basic interest in the EU being able to take decisions as a party to agreements and as a negotiating partner . It will certainly not be possible to decide on this matter before approval of the EU budget for the period 2014 - 2020 , which means that we will have to wait at least ten years for a decision . The criteria we have discussed are already sufficiently clear . High legal standards are set . The further course of these negotiations and their final outcome are still open and I would therefore not like to speculate about what this would mean for the relationship with Switzerland . With no fewer than 18 important treaties , our relationship is now closer than ever before . The Free Trade Treaty and Bilateral Agreements I and II enable us to protect our interests in our relationship with our politically and economically most important partner . This "" bilateral path "" has also been approved by the people of Switzerland on a number of occasions and confirmed in various referenda . That is a good starting point . I do not deny , however , that for the bilateral path to be successful , Switzerland will also need to accept its share of responsibility in Europe : I am referring here to a possible referendum on the Swiss contribution to the enlarged EU . If there is such a referendum , it is to be hoped that this bilateral path with all its consequences will once again be accepted by the people . This is one of the possible ways of increasing the stability of the bilateral path . Experts are looking into whether this could produce a gain for both sides - time will tell . We have supported the former communist countries of eastern Europe in their efforts to introduce reforms and become democracies and social market economies since the early nineties . Switzerland has also been supporting the next accession countries , Romania and Bulgaria , for a long time now as part of our aid to eastern Europe . The economic treaties we have concluded with these countries will be replaced by our bilateral treaties with the EU as soon as they become EU member states . For example , the free trade treaties that we have concluded with these states will be replaced by the Switzerland-EU Free Trade Treaty on the accession date .",human
"electricity - hurdles related to time , technology and finance . The Lampo2 from Protoscar SA in Rovio ( TI ) is not meant to be a series-production vehicle . Its purpose is to show what can already be achieved , given the will - an impressive demonstration of what is possible . As a prototype , the Lampo2 is suitable for everyday traffic and ready to drive . The first Protoscar Lampo was launched to international acclaim at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show . Since then , it has met with broad smiles and admiration on 12,000 test kilometers . Its successor , the Lampo2 , restates Managing Director Marco Piffaretti 's message : "" We aim to show that electric mobility is more than a niche solution . Electric drive is more efficient and even more fun . "" The Lampo2 is also a demonstration of Swiss innovation . Its key components were produced here by Swiss companies . Take an example : Batteries , electric engines , chargers and performance electronics were all supplied by Brusa Elektronik AG in Sennwald ( SG ) - a global leader in the provision of high-tech electric vehicle components . The Lampo2 is a two-seater sports car weighing in at 1.6 tons . The car has one electric engine at the front axle and one at the rear axle , i.e. four-wheel drive . It now has 408 hp compared with the 268 hp generated by its predecessor . At 640 newton meters , the torque is excellent - even higher than a high-volume V8 gas engine . This impressive show of power is produced right from the very first rotation of both electric engines ( approximately 4,500 /min ) - a typical advantage of electric cars . Like all electric vehicles , the Lampo2 requires only one gear . The driving performance is equally impressive . It takes only five seconds to reach 100 km/h , the maximum speed is 200 km/h . Nonetheless , the Lampo2 is said to travel for approximately 200 kilometers on the electricity from two lithium ion batteries , each providing 16 kWh power . The pioneering charging system has four charging modes . The Lampo2 can be charged "" normally "" in twelve hours using a domestic socket , with double the current ( i.e. twice as quickly ) at public stations and with triple the current using industrial connections . The fourth mode is used if you 're in a hurry . In only ten minutes , the car is charged with enough electricity to drive for one hundred kilometers using an external quick-charge system . The world premiere of the Lampo2 will take place at e'mobile 's stand in Geneva . The presentation will be rounded off with innovative approaches to charge systems . Credit Suisse is sponsoring the project because we believe it necessary to invest in innovations and sustainable technologies and because we are aware of our responsibility as a company .",human
"Siemens , ABB , Applied Materials , and Oerlikon - once again sent their leading representatives . Politicians such as EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs , Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce , and the President of the Seychelles , James Alix , also came to discuss the future of renewable energy and environmental technology with corporate representatives . Much of the conference 's power to attract was once again attributable to the ecocity of Masdar . The emirate of Abu Dhabi last year began building the world 's first carbon-dioxide-neutral city . The city will not generate any waste , and will produce all its own energy requirements . Masdar will eventually be home to 50,000 people , and up to 90,000 workers . The emirate intends to invest 15 billion dollars in the plan , and a further seven billion is to be raised from private investors . The slump in oil prices and resultant declining income of the oil-rich emirate will not affect the plans : "" When we decided to build Masdar , back in 2006 , the price of oil was just as low at 44 dollars a barrel , "" says Sultan Al Jaber , CEO of the Masdar operating company . "" We intend to expand our role in the international energy markets . "" In addition to its strong position in fossil fuels , Abu Dhabi intends to make Masdar into a global center for renewable energy sources . Accordingly , Abu Dhabi has set itself a target of raising its proportion of renewable energy from the current level of virtually 0 to 7 percent by 2020 . In global terms , the emirate aims to use Masdar to forge partnerships with a string of companies and governments . During the conference , for example , Masdar and General Electric signed an agreement under which the US conglomerate will set up the first center in its "" Ecomagination "" program in the ecocity . With this program , the US giant is developing ecological business solutions for its entire product range . Swiss Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger signed a declaration of intent with Abu Dhabi for the construction of a "" Swiss village "" in downtown Masdar . A string of Swiss firms are intending to establish a presence there . But the Swiss Embassy too will be relocating from Abu Dhabi to Masdar , and would be the ecocity 's first foreign embassy . This strong Swiss presence has been possible because Swiss companies were involved in Masdar 's development from a very early stage . Zurich-based planning firm Maxmakers was the very first foreign company to collaborate on developing the concept . Credit Suisse manages the 250-million-dollar Masdar Cleantech Private Equity Fund , which invests on a selective basis in companies that operate in the "" green economy . "" Other countries are catching up . Both France and the Netherlands are also interested in having a presence in Masdar . British prime minister Gordon Brown came to Masdar back in October to lobby for British firms and raise capital from Abu Dhabi for the UK 's own "" green "" economy . Masdar is no longer just a few dozen hectares of land on the edge of the capital of the United Arab Emirates ; instead it has become a global vision . A strategic partnership has been entered into with German energy group E.on , for instance . The partners intend to build major renewable energy installations . The first project is the London Array wind farm , sited off the east coast of England . On the conference fringe , the Basque regional government reached agreement with Masdar on setting up a joint venture to manufacture components for production of concentrated solar energy . Abu Dhabi intends to use its new weight in the alternative energy economy at a political level too . For example , the emirate is canvassing for Masdar to be made the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency , set up in Bonn , Germany on January 26 . "" We will pursue this objective aggressively , "" says Al Jaber . The United Arab Emirates is also one of a small group of countries behind next week 's founding of an institute for capturing and storing carbon dioxide in the Australian capital of Canberra . Most participants at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi were agreed that renewable energy has become a global business . "" This is an exciting time for alternative energy , "" says Jeffrey Culpepper , Head of Credit Suisse 's Investment Banking Department in the Middle East and North Africa . The capacity of wind power , for instance , has grown 28 percent on average in recent years - 2008 included . This year , growth is likely to be considerably weaker . But for the period beyond 2010 , there are strong signs of renewed , rapid growth : Under Obama , the US intends to increase federal spending on renewable energy tenfold to 150 billion dollars over 10 years . The EU is planning to treble its share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020 . And in China , wind power continues to grow apace . From Tony Blair 's perspective , this boom in renewable energy cannot come too soon . "" It is now that we must put the world on a path to sustainable growth for the future . """,human
"is the expansion of the NPC standing committee from seven to nine members . "" The new leadership team will increasingly need to practice consensus building amongst themselves "" , says Julien Lippmann from Credit Suisse Equity Research . Jiang Zemin 's "" Three Representations "" theory has also been enshrined in party doctrine . The party now represents "" advanced production forces "" , the "" advanced culture "" and the bulk of the population , in addition to peasants and the working class . In this way , the party aims to strengthen its power base amongst the population . This is a quantum leap that throws out the classical concept of the enemy - capitalists and intellectuals . "" Furthermore , managers at state-owned enterprises now have the chance to join the party and will have a say in party politics "" , explains analyst Julien Lippmann . There is still a lot of work to be done in the area of civil rights , however . The economic situation has improved tremendously . In addition to joining the WTO , the NPC and it 's standing committee have revised patent , copyright and trademark laws . "" Chinese citizens can now acquire the right to own land "" says Julien Lippmann . In the past , the Chinese could buy property but could only rent the land for 50 to 70 years . "" This represents a milestone . Private property will have better protection under the law . "" Although the communist regime continues to hold power , the People 's Republic of China is increasingly developing into a market economy . Reforms can only be tackled gradually . "" The top priority of the government is currently social stability "" , explains Julien Lippmann . Before allowing China 's economy to open , the government guaranteed a job for each citizen . Today unemployment is a major problem : state-owned enterprises are heavily indebted and the government is trying to bolster private enterprise to create new jobs . From December selected institutions will be able to invest in A-shares traded in yuan in Shanghai and Shenzhen . "" Up to now , foreign investors were only allowed to invest in less liquid B-shares or in the H-shares and red chips listed on the Hong Kong exchange "" , says Julien Lippmann . Only Chinese investors were able to invest in A-shares . "" By opening the A-market , the authorities want to attract more foreign direct investment and stimulate stagnating local stock markets . "" Credit Suisse analysts do not expect a rush of foreign interest , however , due to repatriation problems and expensive valuations for A-shares . Credit Suisse therefore continues to focus on selected stocks among the more favorably priced H-shares and red chips . Just how long can China continue to open up its economy without having to introduce political reform ? "" Credit Suisse will maintain its neutral marketing rating until more details of political reforms emerge and the ministerial posts are filled "" , says Julien Lippmann .",human
"We lived by the laws of the jungle . My original partners very nearly forced me out of the business , for example - without providing any form of compensation . And institutional sloppiness and arbitrariness nearly drove me to bankruptcy . Organized crime remains active - but it 's in retreat . And obviously corruption is still an issue . But recently in particular , a lot of things have changed for the better . The reform process is beginning to take effect , and there is broad agreement among people about the need for reforms in the administration and justice system . There have been moments when I 'd think back to good old Switzerland - because Bulgaria was a place where you did n't exactly treat your bitter rivals with kid gloves . But whilst the risk is high , so too are the possible returns - obviously . In terms of pure numbers , we 've increased production from 2,000 bikes annually to 300 , 000 . I 'm also involved in the real estate sector at the moment . In some respects , yes . For an entrepreneur in my line of business , the regulatory situation in Switzerland is pretty offputting . Not to mention the level of wages paid to employees . Sure , in Bulgaria you come up against different problems - but to me they seem easier to solve . In a manufacturing outfit like mine , you are dependent on ensuring consistently high quality . In Switzerland that goes without saying - but here it 's a daily battle . Quality awareness , as well as the dependability of employees , is certainly not as good as in Switzerland . By checking , checking - and more checking . I 'm at the firm every day , and every day I make sure everything is bang in order . Also , I 've been really lucky to have finally found reliable partners a couple of years ago . A lot of things are less highly regulated than in Switzerland . On the other hand , everything 's still extremely bureaucratic . We have several people at our firm who spend their whole time pulling their hair out dealing with the authorities . Practically every document needs to be certified by a notary , for example . In Switzerland , most things are done relatively quickly - but a lot of things are just not possible . In Bulgaria a lot of things would be possible - but it simply takes an extremely long time for them to happen . It 's been worth it . Both the bicycle factory and my dealings in the real estate sector . But then there 's the downside : These seven years have been draining . Even today , not a single day goes by without some kind of bolt from the blue . Anyone thinking about coming here should be in no illusion about it : Bulgaria demands total commitment . From a business point of view : reliable local partners . That makes all the difference . I think it will be two or three generations until Bulgaria really shakes off its communist past , with all its idiosyncrasies . The Bulgarians have to realize the need to go for lasting development - it 's not about short-term , overnight success but about persisting with the reform process . And that includes the reform process going on in people 's minds . It 's about the mentality of the Bulgarians . About issues like reliability and being conscious of quality . About the realization that lasting growth is better than rapid growth that subsequently fizzles out just as quickly . But I 'm confident that this country and the Bulgarians will be successful going forward . ( laughs ) Well , as I said , everyday life in Bulgaria comes at a really high price . On the other hand , we 're continuously expanding in the real estate sector . And we 're even toying with the idea of moving into Georgia or Ukraine .",human
""" "" Many emerging markets are flirting with recession themselves , "" echoed Kasper Bartholdy , Credit Suisse 's chief economist for emerging markets during a panel discussion held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . "" There is no question that 2009 will be a very tough year for emerging markets . "" Latin America is mostly hit by the sharp declines in commodity prices , while emerging countries from the EMEA region mainly suffer from the drop off in international funding flows . The oil producers in the EMEA region are also hit by the sharp decline in oil prices . Africa also significantly feels the impact from the fall in commodity prices . Asia is n't as dependent on international capital and mostly benefits from the lower commodity prices , as most countries in Asia are commodity importers . This does n't mean that Asia is spared from the global slump , Bartholdy noted . "" Asia suffers from the sharp decline in demand for its industrial and manufacturing products . "" According to Bartholdy , there is some good news around : "" Many emerging markets entered the crisis from a position of strength , with strong growth and strong fiscal balances . The vast majority of them have pursued prudent macroeconomic policies that enable them to obtain funding relatively easily from the International Monetary Fund . Their currencies have stabilized after depreciating as much as 20 to 30 percent against the dollar and the euro last autumn . The stability of their currencies has enabled the central banks in various emerging markets to cut their interest rates , helping to reduce the pain a little bit , "" he explained . In his opinion , there are signs hinting that the global economy may be reaching a bottom : "" Commodity prices have been pretty stable in the past two months , and a number of global indicators , whether the German consumer confidence index or the Chinese purchasing managers index ( PMI ) have stopped falling . "" However , emerging markets are n't as affected by the crisis as many developed economies , "" as they did not hold such developed tools in its financial market , "" noted the former Prime Minister of Lebanon Najib Mikati . "" Positive growth is expected in Lebanon in 2009 , notably thanks to the good collaboration between the central bank and the financial sector . This cooperation is built on trust , making our financial sector very safe , "" said Mikati . The Lebanese central bank has managed to double its foreign currency reserves to 20 billion dollars today , from 10 billion dollars a year ago . Mikati is also the co-founder of the industrial conglomerate M1 Group and Investcom , a telecoms business now part of the South African-based mobile telecoms company MTN . "" Just a year ago , Russia was seen as a safe haven . Many people did n't think that the US crisis would affect Russia much , but they were proven wrong , "" said Pavel Teplukhin , who pioneered mutual investment funds and private banking industry in Russia . He is the president of Troika Dialog Asset Management and works as an advisor to the Economic and Finance ministries . "" Russian assets are currently undervalued , but it 's difficult to estimate to what extent as there is no proper revenue forecast available , "" said Teplukhin . China and Russia are in a similar situation today , with potential foreign exchange reserves amounting to between 30 and 40 percent of their gross domestic product . "" They can afford to run a budget deficit for some time , but it 's a very risky way for recovery . The safest way out of the crisis would be to cut government expenses , keep the budget under control , and keep the interest rates low , "" Teplukhin added . "" It would be a mistake to support local household demand . It 's local investment demand which needs support by keeping the cost of capital low . """,human
"opposites as India - not least in terms of the gulf between rich and poor . According to the latest survey by US magazine Forbes , the number of billionaires has grown from 24 to 50 in a year . And the group of the top five richest people in the world includes two Indians : Mukesh Ambani ( 29 billion US dollars ) and Lakshmi Mittal ( 28.7 billion US dollars ) . However , the World Bank estimates that more than 40 percent of India 's population live below the poverty line - which is an income of less than 1.25 dollars per capita per day . Due to extensive poverty amongst the rural population , every day sees thousands leave to try their luck in the cities - particularly Mumbai , where around 20 million people live in the metropolitan district , and New Delhi with its 18 million or so people . No precise figures are available . The last official census took place in 2001 , and every day thousands of new rural refugees stream into the metropolises , initially landing up on the street and then in the slums that are springing up everywhere in the big cities . In total , India currently has 34 cities with more than one million inhabitants . Owing to the high level of poverty amongst the rural population , thousands flee the countryside every day to try their luck in the cities . Because of this influx , India 's one-million-plus metropolises - the country currently has 34 of them - are bursting at the seams . Indeed the current problem of scarce infrastructure resources was the first issue to be addressed on Credit Suisse 's seventh field trip , which was hosted by Arthur Vayloyan , Head of Investment Services and Products in the Private Banking division . Various government agencies anticipate that investments of around USD 500 billion will be needed in the next few years to meet the vast pent-up demand in the transportation sector ( roads , bridges , tunnels , etc. ) as well as in energy , gas and water supply . According to the first guest speaker , Bidisha Ganguly , in Delhi , it is also clear that : "" The center of worldwide growth has shifted eastward , in particular to China and India . "" Head of the Research Department at the Confederation of Indian Industry in New Delhi , she presented an overview of the biggest challenges in the field of infrastructure and made no bones about the fact that many of these projects are often held up by political and bureaucratic obstacles . The fact that road-building remains heavily dependent on manual labor , not least on the part of women , is evidenced on the coach trip to Noida . "" At the end of the day , we 've got to employ the masses of our population somehow , "" says the Indian travel guide . Noida is short for New Okhla Industrial Development Authority . Planned in the 1970s , this new industrial city to the east of New Delhi is now home to around two million people . One of the companies that located there in the 1980s is Moser Baer . It was originally a joint venture with Swiss firm Moser Baer in Sumiswald , though the Swiss are no longer involved . Moser Baer in India is the world 's second largest manufacturer of optical storage media such as CDs , as well as all types of DVD through to Blu-ray discs with up to 25 gigabytes storage capacity , which are then sold under a wide variety of labels . In 2005 , based on synergies in production technology , the technology firm also moved into the manufacturing of photovoltaic solar cells . This was followed in 2006 by the manufacturing and distribution of own-brand home entertainment products and some home electronics products such as headphones , DVD players , and optical computer mice . Moser Baer employs more than 7,000 people at four sites in India . In discussions with Moser Baer 's CEO , conversation inevitably turned to the pros and cons of India versus China as a destination for manufacturing . Abhinav Kanchan , the firm 's Head of Corporate Communications , cited the developing market and business environment , broad support on the part of the government , higher education standards , and above all the benefits of the English language - spoken very well by large sections of the educated population . The second site visit took the group west of Delhi to the industrial area of Gurgaon . This is where , on December 14 , 1983 , India 's first modern passenger car rolled off the production line : the Maruti 800 . Maruti was established by the Indian government in 1981 as a joint venture with Suzuki . Today , it is 54-percent owned by the Japanese auto maker . India is the world 's 12th largest vehicle manufacturer . Around 11 million two , three and four-wheeled vehicles are produced here . Suzuki Maruti is by far the largest manufacturer of cars . With 722,144 cars sold in 2008/2009 , its share of the domestic market amounted to 55 percent . At the same time , nearly 100,000 vehicles go to export - in particular the A-Star mini-car launched two years ago , which is sold in Europe under the Alto name . Suzuki Maruti CFO Ajay Seth is convinced India will become an even more important production location for parent company Suzuki : "" For instance , we are also set to become the first site outside Japan to have its own R & D operation . That enables us to respond more quickly to a booming domestic market . "" A visit to the production plant itself revealed an efficiently functioning manufacturing line with a relatively high proportion of manual labor . Suzuki Maruti employs around 7,500 people at two sites , with Seth proudly emphasizing that its workers have worked at Maruti for 15 years on average - a testament to the good working conditions . A worker who has been with the firm for 10 years will earn around 600 dollars a month . After the visit to Suzuki Maruti , the trip continued to Mumbai . Though New Delhi is the capital and only marginally smaller at 18 million people , for most Indians it is overshadowed by Mumbai . This giant metropolis , squeezed into a peninsula on the country 's west coast , is to Indians what Los Angeles is to Americans : The city of dreams , the story of rags to riches , where Bollywood makes stars out of simple girls from the country , where India 's financial center is housed , and where all major world groups have their offices with all their well-paid jobs . For traffic planners , however , Mumbai is more like the city of nightmares . On the streets , it 's pure chaos . Up to 1995 the city was known as Bombay , and for most locals it still is . But since then it has officially at least borne the name of the goddess of the Koli fisher folk . Every day , around six million people commute downtown from the suburbs in overcrowded trains . Trains arrive at Mumbai 's venerable Victoria Terminus every 45 seconds . In the evenings , people gather in their thousands on the sweeping sandy beaches to enjoy the sunset over the Arabian Sea . The ocean is too polluted to swim in - ‏ but that does n't bother anyone . Indian industrial conglomerate Tata could be about to bring a new era of mobility to India 's roads . Positioned right at the bottom of the price scale , Tata 's Nano car aims to close the wide gap between motorized two-wheelers and the current cheapest car . "" The potential is vast ; every year around 10 million two-wheelers are sold in India , "" says Virat Khullar , Brand Manager with Tata Nano Car . But rather than focus on the urban population , Tata has its sights set on the lower middle classes in rural areas . For 2,500 dollars they 'll get space for four people , protection from the wind and rain , as well as the latest safety standards . The firm has produced a small , bubble-shaped car with four doors , a 35 horsepower two-cylinder engine under the rear seat and some storage room above . It will reach a top speed of around 100 km/h , and consume about 4.5 liters of gasoline every 100 km . On a test drive , the super-affordable car proved surprisingly spacious and the equipment - whilst very basic - was user-friendly . It is still too early to say whether the concept will enjoy long-term success on the sales front . Production is still in the start-up phase . Problems over land purchases led to protests at the construction site of the original plant . Though Tata won the court case and still owns the land , the group management would have preferred to move production to a new site , says Virat Khullar . "" In particular , this was also so as not to expose workers to these protests . "" Accordingly , only 25,000 of the 200 , 000-plus Nanos already ordered have actually been delivered . "" Interestingly , 100,000 customers have already paid for their car in advance and are now waiting patiently for it to arrive . "" If production and demand develop as hoped , a move abroad is expected in five years . With perfect timing , a presentation on the dabbawala - a success story dating back more than 100 years - was given shortly before lunch . The dabbawala is a type of lunchbox delivery service : For the equivalent of six dollars a month , a dabbawala delivery man picks up the freshly prepared lunch at 10 o'clock in the morning and by means of a finely tuned collection , transportation and distribution system ensures it is delivered to the customer in good time for lunch . More than 200,000 lunch boxes are delivered every day in Mumbai by 5,000 delivery men . And the error rate is ... just one in 16 million ! The afternoon was devoted entirely to the subject of Bollywood . Film producer Bobby Bedi first of all gave a brief introduction . For the average Indian , he says , food is closely followed by cinema on their list of priorities . Bedi proudly states that : "" Only the US and Indian film industries survive entirely without government subsidy and indeed actually pay taxes . "" Unlike Hollywood , however , Bollywood 's commercial success is almost entirely dependent on the home market . "" So it 's a good thing that there are 1.3 billion of us , "" jokes Bedi . In terms of the number of produced movies , Bollywood actually exceeds Hollywood . Yet at five percent it generates only a fraction of the revenues , according to Bedi . With the price of movie theater tickets ranging from only 0.05 to 4.00 Swiss francs - depending on the facilities on offer ( air-conditioning or not ) , as well as the location - that 's hardly surprising . Filmcity in Mumbai does n't have much of an air of glamour about it . The scenery at the various locations where movies are shot is set up in a very makeshift way . Right across the hilly site , crews were busy shooting outdoor scenes . For Bedi , an important element of Bollywood films involves bringing the world to India 's silver screen . That 's why they usually shoot at nice locations a long way from Mumbai - in particular the Swiss Alps . A visit to the digital studios of Prime Focus , a production firm focused on visual special effects , proved informative . Set up in 1995 by four young movie fans , it is now a global company that operates seven days a week , 24 hours a day . A key pillar is the conversion of 2D images into 3D experiences . Prime Focus also worked on around 200 takes for the blockbuster Avatar , for instance . Prime Focus is now active on three continents and in five time zones with 15 studios . Besides post-production for cinema films , the firm is also a sought-after partner for advertising films . In India in particular , this business is exploding right now . More than 50,000 TV and cinema adverts were shot in 2009 , a number that is set to grow to 85,000 in 2010 . The final day in Mumbai involved visits to the Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ) and a charity-based training project . Though at first sight rather low-tech in infrastructure terms , it trains IT engineers who are sought-after throughout the world . India has a total of seven such technology institutes , which are considered a veritable springboard to a successful career . Those wanting a place to study have to pass a very tough selection process . Of the 500,000 students who sit an entry test each year , only one percent - the top 5,000 - get a place . Anyone wishing to do a masters after their bachelor 's degree has to pass another acceptance test - and here only one in three succeed . On the other hand , says Rajeev Deshpande , the IIT 's Chief Development Officer , virtually no-one drops out during the program . "" The people here have proven that they are capable and are determined to seize this opportunity . "" Many of the attendees manage to get lucrative job offers , usually from global companies , during their final semester . "" Right from the start , most of them are earning more than us professors , "" says Deshpande , quoting an average annual salary of 15,000 dollars . In India , that means they are already ranked as upper middle class . Those who really strike it lucky would receive a Western wage from a global company in India , frequently with a starting salary of 70,000 dollars or more . Residents of a slum district in Mumbai 's Bandra East , where the Kherwadi Social Welfare Association operates a professional training center for young adults , earn less than 1,000 dollars a year in most cases . There , young people aged between 16 and 25 get on-the-job training to become mechanics , air-conditioning and refrigeration fitters , data processors , beauticians , and care assistants . During the presentation , other aid and microfinance organizations had an opportunity to showcase themselves and their various proposed solutions . The visit to the slum district of Bandra East brought the four-day India field trip to an impressive close . Participants returned home full of impressions and observations of a country that is on the move - of a country that is scarcely surpassed in terms of its variety and contrasts and which , notwithstanding all its problems , quite clearly offers a wealth of opportunities and possibilities .",human
"terms we think that China will have become the second largest consumer market overtaking Japan . Today the trade surplus in China is about 7 percent of the GDP . Which is about 150 billion Dollars . Overall they are importing about US$800bn but a significant proportion of that is inputs to manufactured goods industries which then re-export . The imports are skewed towards oil , mineral ores , components , intermediate goods and construction equipment . Some are high value-added manufactured goods like airplanes . Direct consumer product imports are quite small because many multinationals manufacture these into China to sell domestically . This is the case for mobile phone handsets and cosmetics for example . Obviously there are some luxury products that are imported . In our survey the LVMH Group ( Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy "" , the worlds largest luxury goods conglomerate ) is doing very well , for example and will almost certainly continue to do so . High End autos could also be among these products . We find that the German automakers like BMW are doing better in our survey this year than last year . There are two items on that wish list we should talk about : Travel , which is quite important . And the property market , which is certainly very alive . The data about travel and tourism in our survey is very interesting . 38 percent of our respondents have taken a holiday last year . Now , you must imagine that until quite recently in China most people have been working six days a week , taking off one or two days a year . Now there are national holiday weeks and we find that the average spend on a holiday is getting on to a month 's disposable income . And people are travelling domestically in China to a huge degree . Which makes things such as the hotel sector quite interesting . There are Internet based ticket agencies and domestic airlines that have been very successful . That is why China is buying so many Airbus and Boeing planes . And you also would say that the sector would formalize over time . There are no national two or three stars hotel chains in China now . At some stage they will either develop locally or companies like Accor or Intercontinental or Marriott will do that in China . Yes , they are . 12 percent want to take their next vacation abroad within the next year . Particularly to Europe and to the rest of South East Asia . Partly that is a visa issue . People can now travel as individuals to Hong Kong and Macau and on group visas to Europe . In case of Europe I think that France in particular has advertised its attractions within China . America is very low down on the priority of places to visit for Chinese people . The auto market continues to grow steadily . The problem is pricing power and weak brands . Volkswagen and also General Motors have not been doing that well in the market according to our survey respondents . Housing is a very important topic . We have got 60 percent of our respondents living in a property that they own themselves resulting from the mass privatization in the late 90s . No less than 18 percent are planning to buy a property in the next year . Either to trade up or to buy for the first time . Yes . Property is a very important part of Chinese consumer wealth . And they are quite unleveraged in the housing sector . Only about 10 percent of our respondents have any kind of a mortgage on their property . Yes , only 10 percent . The reason for that is that the state used to own all the property . It actually does own the free hold land . But property was privatized in the cities . People were effectively given a long lease on their apartment or house almost for free in the 1990s . And now , as people 's income goes up they are trying to trade up . There certainly are cultural influences that one can already see . Look at Hollywood movies . I have n't seen the new Mission Impossible III yet . But I gather a large part of it is set in Asia . The use of silk in fashion has increased quite heavily . The aesthetics in the way modern hotels are designed is increasingly Asian . And ultimately we will see some of these Chinese branded goods emerge with success in the western consumers markets . It is a two-way exchange , of course . But the influence of China will make itself noticeable in a lot more domains than just the economy .",human
"infrastructure , the development of processes , innovations and human capital in the Swiss economy . The importance of these two big banks for the Swiss economy can be summed up by the figure "" forty percent . "" Together , they account for an estimated 40 % of the overall value generated by banks and pay an average of about 40 % of the tax contributions by banks . Furthermore , they employ over 40 % of all personnel in the Swiss banking sector and account for 40 % of domestic banking transactions . As a banking center , Switzerland has a dual structure : A rough distinction can be made between institutions with a national focus ( cantonal banks , Raiffeisen banks , commercial banks , regional banks and savings banks ) and internationally oriented banks ( big banks , stock exchange banks , private banks and foreign banks ) . Whereas the former primarily operate in the deposits and loans business , the latter operate mainly in global asset management and investment banking . As globally active full-service banks , the big banks are a firm feature of both domestic and foreign transactions . Nevertheless , their market share for domestic transactions ( 41 % ) is considerably smaller than for transactions involving foreign clients ( 82 % ) . The big banks are very important market participants for investing savings and pension capital in Switzerland . In 2007 , domestic creditors of the two institutions entrusted assets worth a total of CHF 348 bn to them . This gave the big banks a 45.3 % share of the overall market and 59.7 % of the market for fixed-term deposits . At the end of 2007 , in terms of occupational benefits and fixed pension plans , the big banks managed an estimated CHF 220-250 bn ( almost half of the total in Switzerland ) in securities safekeeping accounts for domestic pension funds , vested benefits accounts / assets for insured persons , and fixed pension plan accounts and investments . The big banks are the largest providers in the domestic credit market , financing 36 % of loans to private households and 42 % of all corporate loans . In terms of loans to SMEs - the cornerstones of the Swiss economy - their market share stands at over 30 % . Regardless of the type of debtor , unsecured loans are also awarded in Switzerland . In this type of transaction , the bank can only bring direct action against the debtor alone and has no further collateral in the form of shares , for example , or guarantees . Around 25 % of all loans in Switzerland are requested without collateral , more than half of which are awarded by the big banks . The market share of the big banks on the Swiss mortgage market amounts to 35 % . Alongside these mortgage volumes worth CHF 236 bn - which corresponds to almost half of the entire Swiss gross domestic product ( GDP ) - it is also worth mentioning construction loans , where the big banks hold a market share of around 28 % . However , these banks are not only present as lenders on the real estate market . The pension funds of both banks hold direct investments of CHF 2.9 bn in Swiss properties , and indirect investments of CHF 0.9 bn . In addition , for SMEs , which - due to the limited size of the domestic market - are dependent on global commerce , trade finance services ( such as financing , risk minimization , diversification , support with import-export activities , etc. ) . Due to their international orientation , big banks are particularly suitable for providing these services . Their size gives rise to economies of scale , and makes it easier to hedge risks . Credit Suisse is the Swiss market leader in export financing , and one of the largest providers on an international level . Asset management can be regarded as a core competency and a central , stable pillar of Switzerland as a banking center . According to information issued by the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) at the end of August 2008 , securities portfolios held in client safekeeping accounts at Swiss banks amounted to around CHF 4.8 bn . The market share of the big banks can be estimated in terms of commission revenues . On this basis , the big banks possessed by far the largest proportion of managed safekeeping account holdings as at the end of 2007 . Investment banking comprises both classic investment banking services ( corporate financing , capital market emissions , mergers and takeovers ) and trading transactions ( securities , foreign exchange , commodities and banknote trading , as well as issuing and secondary market trading of structured products ) . In Switzerland , companies active on the capital market are just as dependent on investment banking for obtaining investment resources , financing international activities and stock market flotation as they are on the public sector for infrastructure and equipment investments . The big banks ' investment banking activities in Switzerland are rooted firmly in the capital requirements of companies , and to a lesser extent on proprietary securities trading . Due to their specialist expertise and size , the two big banks are the prime pillars of investment banking in Switzerland . In 2007 , their share of this market was as follows : stock market flotation : 35 % ; bonds issued by Swiss borrowers : 46 % ; mergers and acquisitions : 50 % ; foreign exchange trading : estimated at 50 % . The main criteria for evaluating the economic importance of the big banks are value creation and employment . Tax receipts and the influence on the Swiss balance of payments are also of macroeconomic relevance . In 2006 , value generated by the banking sector amounted to CHF 40.7 bn ( 8.4 % of GDP ) . No figures are collected for the individual banking groups ; value created by the two big banks is estimated at around CHF 15-17 bn . In 2007 , the gross value creation per employee in the banking sector was more than double that for the rest of the tertiary sector . This high productivity is reflected in higher-than-average salaries . At CHF 8,745 , the average monthly salary in the banking sector is considerably higher than the Swiss average salary of CHF 5 , 979 . The two big banks are among the largest employers in Switzerland . In 2007 , of the 3,264,527 full-time equivalent positions in Switzerland , 108,821 were in the banking sector . The big banks employ 46,210 people , which corresponds to 42.5 % of all full-time positions in the entire banking sector . In addition , the big banks train a high number of employees in Switzerland , with Credit Suisse and UBS offering , among other things , 330 ( 180 CS and 150 UBS ) placements for students , and 525 ( 300 CS and 225 UBS ) graduate jobs . Furthermore , around 200 apprentices per year complete a commercial banking apprenticeship or IT apprenticeship at Credit Suisse , with around 40 high school graduates participating in the Junior Banking Program . The sum of the salaries received by big bank employees in 2007 was estimated at CHF 6.1 bn . A large proportion of this income flows back into the economy through consumption . Based on the fact that people in the income category of big-bank employees spend some 57.8 % of their income , total consumer spending by the big banks ' workforce amounts to CHF 3.5 bn per year . The counterpart to consumption is saving . In the income class of big-bank employees , 14.6 % of disposable income is saved . Due to the substantial salaries paid , this high saving rate ( well above the Swiss average of 10.1 % ) results in a large volume of savings . The banks make a substantial contribution to tax receipts in Switzerland . The tax contributions fall into three categories : Taxes paid by financial intermediaries ( income taxes and taxes on capital , as well as "" hidden "" taxation via VAT ) . Taxation of production factors ( income tax on employees ' salaries / bonuses and tax paid on dividends by shareholders ) . Taxes paid on client transactions with banks ( these generate a significant proportion of stamp duty and withholding tax , alongside VAT on financial services and on the quarter of the EU withholding tax on interest income that remains in Switzerland ) . Over the past three years , the banking sector has generated a total of CHF 13-15 bn in taxes . This accounts for 12-14 % of tax receipts for the Confederation , cantons and municipalities . The contribution made by the big banks can be put at CHF 4.5-5.5 bn ( 4-5 % of total tax revenues ) . In 2006 , Switzerland posted a balance of payments surplus of CHF 72 bn ( 14.7 % of GDP ) , meaning the country 's income from business with foreign countries is consistently higher than its expenses . Alongside successful foreign trade , this also reflects the country 's substantial net foreign assets of around CHF 600 bn . At an estimated CHF 20-25 bn , the banks make a weighty contribution to the balance of payments surplus . We can assume that a large proportion of this amount is accountable to the two big banks . The big banks are major purchasers of intermediate inputs , spending an estimated CHF 4.7 bn in Switzerland , including both domestic and foreign suppliers . Under the assumption that value created by these suppliers benefits Switzerland , the purchases made by the big banks would generate around CHF 2.4 bn in added value and 19,275 jobs . The consultancy and advertising industries are among the major suppliers , as well as the construction trade . A secure , efficient financial infrastructure is key to the value-added chain of Switzerland as a financial center , and therefore to the entire Swiss economy . Network effects , increasing economies of scale and scope and high fixed costs play an important role in such infrastructure services , for instance the provision of trading platforms . As major shareholders , the two big banks contribute greatly to this infrastructure . At 31.1 % , they hold the most significant proportion of all banking groups of the share capital of Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange Group ( SIX Group ) . Under normal market conditions , the big banks play a major role in keeping the money and capital markets afloat . As net borrowers , they enable other banks , for instance , to temporarily invest surplus liquidity . They also absorb a significant proportion of repurchase agreements ( repos ) , which are used by the Swiss National Bank to control liquidity on the money market . Finally , the big banks endeavor to constantly develop their services . This research and innovation benefits the whole of Switzerland as a financial center . Of course , the services described are just one part of the jigsaw that makes up this financial center . The asset management skills of the big banks and their global networks play a considerable role in their strength . This benefits the entire Swiss economy .",human
"environment for stocks everywhere . But O'Sullivan expects European and Japanese equities to outperform British and American stocks over the next three to six months , largely due to differences in monetary policy . "" The Bank of England will very soon start draining liquidity , and it 's an open question when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise rates , "" he says . "" In Europe and Japan , not only do you have a cyclical recovery , but the European Central Bank is active , and the Bank of Japan is expected to be active later on this year . "" In early June , the European Central Bank introduced negative deposit rates and announced a targeted long-term refinancing operation ( TLTRO ) that could inject as much as 1 trillion euros into European banks over the next two years . It 's not as dramatic as quantitative easing , but O'Sullivan says the move was nevertheless a significant event in a region where banks have been deleveraging for the last two years . "" The effect of this kind of extraordinary monetary policy should be quite different in Europe than in the United States , "" he says . "" Whereas the US is a market-driven economy , Europe is much more reliant upon banks and should see a relatively larger benefit from an attempt to push more liquidity into the banking system . "" The measures , says O'Sullivan , should bolster the ongoing European recovery and prevent a deflationary shock . ( Annual inflation in Europe has been below 1 percent for nine months . ) The European manufacturing sector expanded for the twelfth straight month in June , while services businesses reported an eleventh consecutive month of growth . If demand for consumer goods and industrial equipment keeps rising , the ECB may succeed in easing credit conditions just as businesses are seeking fresh loans to invest and expand . What 's more , says O'Sullivan , the ECB could still introduce an asset purchase program later this year . Equities in peripheral Europe have outperformed over the past year , but Credit Suisse 's Private Banking analysts believe markets may have overheated in places such as Italy , where equities are up 14 percent year to date . They think that German stocks , which are poised to benefit from an already strong economy 's accelerating growth over the next six months , have more room to run . In Japan , meanwhile , the consumer price index rose 3.4 percent and 3.7 percent year-over-year in April and May , respectively , the highest rates in 32 years and a welcome change from the drag of deflation between June 2012 and May 2013 . Some of that increase could be due to the after-effects of retailers hiking their prices ahead of a value-added tax increase in April , but Credit Suisse economists believe inflation would have been positive even after adjusting for the tax hike . Retail sales fell 4.4 percent year-over-year in April , but only 0.4 percent in May , indicating that sticker shock may be fading . Two months does not a trend make , however , and Private Banking analysts say the Bank of Japan will likely re-evaluate the state of the recovery in the third quarter , despite the fact that Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in April that he saw no need for further stimulus . At the very least , the analysts believe policymakers will continue their current 6 trillion yen ( 59 billion US dollars ) to 8 trillion yen ( 79 billion US dollars ) in monthly asset purchases until the end of 2015 . Companies included in the benchmark TOPIX index have announced 25 billion US dollars ' worth of stock buybacks this year , spurred on by relatively low valuations , low interest rates , and a 232 trillion yen ( 2.29 trillion US dollar ) cash pile . O'Sullivan says companies that would benefit from a cyclical upturn , such as industrials companies and machinery manufacturers , look particularly promising . Structural reforms - the so-called third arrow of Abenomics - could also boost Japanese equities . In June , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to below 30 percent and shifting Japanese government pension fund allocations away from government bonds toward equities . Many investors in British and American equities have profited handsomely over the last few years from central bank-fueled economic recoveries . In today 's market , the geography has shifted , but not the strategy .",human
"the title in Cincinnati - only twice had he completed these two tournaments in the Masters series as successfully , in 2007 and 2010 , when he also responded to a defeat in the final in Canada with a triumph in Cincinnati . He had now contested ten matches in 13 days , as well as changed locations . Also behind him was a final that could have backfired on him . Defeat at the hands of David Ferrer , who played exceptionally well , would probably have dealt a blow to his confidence . It would have been his first in 16 encounters with the indefatigable Iberian , who has a talent for mercilessly exploiting the slightest weakness in his opponent and who Federer asserts has made the most of his career . Most of all , it would have been the sixth final defeat in his eighth final of the season , and the fourth in the Masters series . In Indian Wells , he succumbed to Novak Djokovic in a tiebreaker in the third set , in Monte Carlo he lost to Stan Wawrinka having been a set ahead , and in Toronto he suffered a rare defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga . At Wimbledon , meanwhile , he was beaten in the deciding set by Djokovic . However , Federer had by now played a set that raised his already increased confidence to a new level . Ferrer had played magnificently , seizing the second set 6-1 , at one stage even holding two set points that would have made it 6-0 . Yet Federer 's response and the way in which he wrested free of Ferrer 's clutches could not have been more impressive . He dominated the final set from start to finish , winning the match 6-3 , 1-6 , 6-2 and thereby achieving another milestone in his career - the first significant one since his 33rd birthday . For statistics fans : It was his most prestigious title in two years , since his fifth win in Cincinnati in 2012 , and his third of the season ( after Dubai and Halle ) ; in addition , it was his 22nd in the Masters series and 80th overall . Only Jimmy Connors ( 109 ) and Ivan Lendl ( 94 ) have enjoyed more success . Above all , it was the manner in which he was able to pick himself up that contributed to Federer 's euphoria . "" It was a wonderful tournament . I got stronger every round and managed to bring out my best tennis in the last set , "" he declared enthusiastically . "" That 's exactly how you want to win championships , and the fact that it was my 80th makes it even better . "" He managed to do everything he needed in the last set : "" At the end , I played like a dream ; I was serving perfectly , with good variation . That 's why I think I deserved to win the title . "" He admitted that at the beginning of the week , he had even considered for a moment whether to drop out of Cincinnati after the grueling event in Toronto , where he mostly played late into the evening . Now he was happy that he had decided against it : "" Now I 've been rewarded for that with a title . "" Also awaiting him now was the US Open , to which he was looking forward enormously . Nonetheless , it was a good time to stop for a moment and take a breath . Although Federer had won many matches this year , to the point that he left Cincinnati having notched up victories 45 to 49 , making him the player with the most match wins in the season so far , he had so far lost out at the major titles , mainly to Stan Wawrinka ( Australian Open , Monte Carlo ) , Rafael Nadal ( Madrid , Roland Garros ) , and Novak Djokovic ( Miami , Indian Wells , Rome , Wimbledon ) . Yet whereas Nadal has had to take another injury break because of his right wrist ( after Toronto and Cincinnati , he is also missing New York , where he swept to victory in 2013 ) , Djokovic has managed to win only two matches in two tournaments since Wimbledon and his wedding , and Wawrinka has also failed to make much headway , he has now proved to himself and the whole world that even at the age of 33 , he still has the elixir of champions that has carried him to countless championships and records ; that his back problems are a thing of the past ; and that his arduous year in 2013 was not the beginning of the end but merely a temporary lull brought on by physical problems . The excellent position into which the father of four has once again managed to maneuver himself has naturally inspired fresh hope in himself and his giant global fan base that he could finish this year with yet another grand slam title - his eighteenth . Federer will start in Flushing Meadows as the second seed and the player on the best current form , although Djokovic and Wawrinka , who faced each other in the semi-final last year , are likely to raise their game substantially over Canada and Ohio thanks to the best-of-five format . Meanwhile , the young guard of Grigor Dimitrov , Milos Raonic , and Kei Nishikori will sense an opportunity to break into the ranks of grand slam winners . A love story developed between Federer and Flushing Meadows at an early stage - in fact , he was the first professional to win the US Open five times in succession ( 2004 to 2008 ) . Since then , however , his quest for a sixth triumph in the 23 , 763-seater Arthur Ashe Stadium , the world 's largest tennis arena , has been in vain . In the 2009 final , he lost a 2-1 lead over Argentine Juan Martin del Potro , while events repeated themselves in rare fashion in 2010 and 2011 , when on each occasion , two match points were not enough to win the semi-final against Djokovic . The following year , he failed to make it past the quarter-final against Czech player Tomáš Berdych , before reaching an unexpected low point twelve months ago with his first defeat to Spaniard Tommy Robredo in the fourth round . This year , however , he is starting from a much better position - almost ideal , in fact . Federer is comfortable in the knowledge that he is playing at a high enough level and that he has done his homework and has no need to put in extra shifts shortly before the tournament as he did last year . "" Now it 's important for me to take enough of a break , keep my head fresh and hold on to my hunger to win , so that I do n't start the tournament exhausted , "" he said in Cincinnati , where his girls were delighted that their dad had finally picked up a major trophy again - even if it did somewhat resemble an old-fashioned vase . "" In training , it 's now just about staying at a good level , "" commented Federer , who knows how important it is to stay confident . "" Once you 've gotten used to winning , as I have , you have to re-learn how to lose . "" Words that only a champion sure of his own abilities would say .",human
"result of slower employment growth . However , one potential driver of the super-cycle remains in place , even if its impact has weakened : Interest rates will stay at zero for the coming year . Since the European Central Bank ( ECB ) will have to embark on a more expansionary course if it wants to combat the risk of deflation , Credit Suisse economists believe the SNB will maintain its zero interest rate policy in order to preserve the minimum EUR / CHF exchange rate of 1.20 . In view of the low rate of inflation in Switzerland ( 2014 : 0.1 percent ; 2015 : 0.5 percent ) and business cycle risks , there is no reason for the SNB to alter its monetary policy . Compared to the past two years when the growth rate was well over 2 percent , consumer growth has now lost much of its momentum . Credit Suisse economists are predicting growth of 1.2 percent for this year and 1.0 percent for 2015 . They believe that various factors have contributed to the slowdown in consumer growth . The market for consumer durables is , for example , becoming saturated , and the number of new consumers is declining as a result of slower immigration . In addition , the period in which price discounts were being driven by exchange rate appreciation is over , and the distortions caused by the restructuring of hospital financing - which inflated the figures for the growth in healthcare consumption in 2013 - are disappearing . The economists also predict lower levels of capital spending in 2014 and 2015 ( forecasts for capital spending on machinery and equipment stand at 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent for 2014 and 2015 , respectively ) , a trend that can be attributed to subdued demand for exports . Capital spending on new construction also looks likely to fall from 3.5 percent this year to 1.0 percent in 2015 in response to the general slowdown in construction demand and reduced capacity expansion in the construction sector . The low propensity to invest is due , to a small extent , to the approval of the initiative against mass immigration . According to a survey of purchasing managers carried out by procure.ch ( the trade association for procurement and supply management in Switzerland ) in conjunction with Credit Suisse , 10 percent of Swiss companies intend to increase their level of capital spending outside Switzerland due to the change in the operating environment . However , the large majority of companies have made no change to their capital spending plans . Three-quarters of companies also assume that Switzerland will find a solution with the European Union ( EU ) and that the bilateral agreements will therefore remain in force after February 9 , 2017 . In view of the sluggish recovery in the euro zone and the depressed investment climate , the recovery of the Swiss export sector is likely to be too modest to compensate for the loss of momentum in the domestic economy . Credit Suisse economists are predicting export growth of 5.0 percent in the coming year , after 3.0 percent in 2014 . More than half of Swiss export revenues are generated in the EU . The German federal state of Baden-Württemberg alone imports more Swiss goods than China and Hong Kong together . This is just one example to illustrate the close ties between Switzerland and the EU . This relationship is one of the main areas examined in ' Monitor Switzerland ' , which was recently published by Credit Suisse economists . The latest issue of this publication also shows that Swiss exporters have benefited more from the bilateral agreements than the EU has . The slowing of the super-cycle in China and other emerging economies and the question which of these countries are best placed to return to sustainable economic growth is another core topic covered in ' Monitor Switzerland ' . An analysis of global demographic trends shows that many countries - especially China but also nations such as Germany - are now facing the possibility of a ' Japanese scenario ' with a declining population . According to a simulation carried out by Credit Suisse economists , economic growth in Switzerland will also be jeopardized in the long term if there is no immigration . If there is no change in labor force participation and no immigration , the working population will start to decline as early as 2017 . The increased mobilization of the working potential of women and older employees would merely postpone the downward trend for about five years . Economic growth in Switzerland would continue to decline significantly and , in a little over 10 years , the result could be economic stagnation . The latest issue of ' Monitor Switzerland ' also shows how the fiscal importance of expenditure-based taxation varies between cantons and highlights the sectors in which the greatest number of bankruptcies can be expected . Forecasts for the real estate market and a commentary on the concept of an extended Free Trade Agreement with the EU complete the range of topics discussed in ' Monitor Switzerland ' . ' Monitor Switzerland ' is published quarterly . The next issue will appear on December 11 , 2014 .

"the US currency will begin in 2014 , according to their forecasts . In an early October report , analysts noted that the dollar rally had stalled against the G10 currencies . Despite weakening slightly in December , the dollar has been trending higher since mid-October . The Bank of England 's effective exchange rate data shows that at 87'3986 as of Jan. 7 , the dollar is approximately 7 percent stronger than it was at the beginning of 2013 . Credit Suisse expects the trade-weighted dollar index to rise to 90.70 over the next three months and to 95.99 over the coming year . The analysts say a likely divergence in monetary policymaking among the world 's largest central banks in 2014 should give the rally traction . Consider the following three examples : The Fed announced in December that it would begin reducing quantitative easing measures , while the Bank of Japan is widely expected to step up its own asset-buying program early this year.With inflation at worryingly low levels , the European Central Bank is not only unlikely to raise rates , but could actually ease further.The mining investment boom that had thus far helped Australia to avoid most of the negative effects of the Great Recession has just about run its course . Credit Suisse 's analysts expected mining investment to peak at about 8 percent of GDP in 2013 . The Australian economy is due for a major rebalancing , and if the value of the Aussie does n't fall on its own , the Reserve Bank of Australia will come under more pressure to push it down by cutting interest rates again . The central bank already made 25-basis-point cuts in both May and August of 2013 , leaving the current cash rate at 2.5 percent . As a result of the above , the Credit Suisse analysts expect the yen and the Australian dollar to fall "" substantially "" against the greenback , and for the euro to follow suit later on . They expect the dollar-yen exchange rate , for example , to rise to 120 yen for every dollar from its current level of about 105 , according to a recent forecast report in December . And while an Australian dollar now gets you about 0.89 US dollars , it will only get you 0.80 US dollars this time by the end of this year , the analysts forecast . Similarly , a single euro will currently buy you about 1.36 US dollars , but they expect that to fall to 1.24 US dollars by December 2014 . And the analysts do n't expect the moves to be short-lived . Rather , they consider early 2014 to be the long-awaited start of a period of dollar outperformance of a kind that historically has lasted anywhere from six to nine years . It took six months for the divergence to get going , so the dollar 's response to interest rate changes is neither automatic nor immediate . Indeed , in seven out of eight recent periods in which interest rates rose - the first in March 1972 and the most recent in June 2004 - the dollar actually lost value in the first year of each multi-year cycle before eventually following the more logical trajectory of strengthening . Investors were not simply being irrational by shunning dollars just as they are expected to begin appreciating . Consider what it means to "" own "" , or to be long , the dollar . Most investors seeking a way to profit from changes in exchange rates turn to government bonds , and in the case of the dollar , that means Treasuries . Given the size of the U.S. government 's current account deficit , which is financed with regular auctions of Treasury bills and notes , odds are that these investors already have a significant chunk of Treasury securities in their portfolios . And as rates were rising , they were watching the value of those assets erode . With little clarity on just how far rates could go , the risk of buying too soon was akin to doubling down on an unfavorable investment - and the possibility that the new purchases would soon be declining in value as well . What we witnessed for much of 2013 is the outcome of that thought process in action . As the yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen , foreign owners of these bonds have responded by selling , rather than by buying more . Markets had long been expecting the Federal Reserve to start reducing monthly asset purchases either in December or January , and now that they have actually done so , Credit Suisse expects U.S. Treasury yields should soon stabilize at a new , higher level ( around 3 percent on 10-year notes , close to the current 2.96 percent rate ) . Considering both of those things , history and logic suggest that investors would focus less on their recent capital losses ( and the fear of adding to them ) and more on the opportunity presented by higher yields . That mindset shift seems now to be under way , if belatedly so . It 's a great reminder that even if two market trends tend to frequent the same parties , they may not always arrive together .",human
". In the following report , these scenarios are re-assessed , based in particular on the policy changes that have occurred since then . The development of the EMU crisis at the end of 2011 was similar - but not identical - to what the above core scenarios had foreseen . Triggered by the worsening fiscal outlook in Greece and increasing evidence that the government was unable to push through the EU / IMF consolidation and reform program , fears of a larger default intensified . Fiscal slippage and political uncertainty in Italy - but in particular also the announcement that the private sector would have to face a bigger loss with Greek debt restructuring - subsequently triggered serious "" contagion . "" This , in turn , led to a massive sell-off in Italian sovereign bonds and even greater pressure on bank stocks and bonds , in Italy and beyond . In effect , southern Europe was experiencing a massive "" bank-run , "" in which investors withdrew money from local banks and forced these into selling assets , including government bonds . At the macroeconomic level , the south was experiencing a balance of payments crisis , in which both government and the financial sector were at risk of losing access to external financing . As households transferred capital abroad , the situation was exacerbated . Various efforts by political leaders to halt the spiral failed . While some commitments were made by the "" strong "" countries to boost support funds for crisis-affected countries , these commitments were far too small relative to the funding needs . If no other source of financing had been provided , the break-up risk of EMU would have quickly increased . The key to short-circuiting that risk and stabilizing both debt and equity markets clearly was the decisive intervention by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in December , in which banks were offered huge loans , at attractive rates and for an extended period . This financing effectively halted the run on the banks as well as the pressure to sell sovereign bonds and halted the draining of funds from the southern European countries . The core scenario for 2012 is one of continued crisis containment . Given that fiscal deficits of many countries remain high and large current-account deficits will still need to be funded , the key to stability remains the availability of a lender of last resort , which prevents a negative spiral of capital flight developing as occurred in 2011 . It is clear that even if the European Stability Mechanism were launched on time in July 2012 - which has somewhat greater resources at its disposal than the EFSF and is less cumbersome due to a different financing structure - this backstop would be insufficient to reassure investors . The same goes for funds of the G- 20 and/or International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) that may become available . The continued commitment of the ECB to act as a lender of last resort to banks and thus indirectly to governments is key to preserving the stability gains of the past weeks . In the longer term , the move to sustainable fiscal deficits and debt levels is , of course , crucial . But getting there will take time , not least because the Eurozone likely faces a rather prolonged period of slow economic growth . The establishment of the ECB "" firewall "" described above paradoxically increases the risk of a Greek exit from the EMU . The reason is that the ECB 's ( implicit ) commitment to protect the banking sectors - and also the sovereigns - of major borrowers such as Italy and Spain reduces the fear of contagion should a smaller country exit . The exit of a country from EMU would trigger defaults well beyond those of just the exiting government , because the private sector in a country that had introduced a weaker currency would also no longer be able to service the remaining ( hard ) EUR obligations . To offset the financial stress caused by such a step would therefore also require decisive support from the ECB for the countries remaining within monetary union . Conversely , reduced fears of an exit by an EMU member would reduce the willingness of other governments to fund "" profligate "" members . Since the ECB 's action , it has already become clear that the external pressure on Greece to decisively tighten fiscal policy has increased . The pressure on local politicians has thus increased too . The risk that they choose the option of exiting EMU - which essentially means resorting to a local "" printing press "" - thus has intensified as well . This option is less likely than adherence to EMU , but the probability of an EMU exit by Greece has certainly grown .",human
"there was still some work to be done , as far as Renoir is concerned . Nina Zimmer Definitely ! It would have to be "" The Gypsy Girl , "" or "" Summer , 1868 "" as it is also known . In this painting , we see a young woman - Renoir 's longtime model and muse , Lise Tréhot - who , we now know , was pregnant at the time . Her expression is weary and melancholy . The roughly painted background is in stark contrast to the hands , with their realistic red veins . Unusually , too , the hair is loose and the blouse has slipped lasciviously off her shoulder . Ignoring the artistic conventions of the day , Renoir has captured an ordinary , intimate moment . It would have been obvious to any contemporary observer that the girl in the painting was a lover , a provincial mistress , as many Parisians would have had at that time . The portrait challenges you to recognize yourself as a contemporary observer . Even so , the work opened the door for Renoir to the official Salon des Beaux Arts , which was a resounding success . Many of the Impressionists were born into bourgeois families , but rebelled against the prevailing morality , defiantly espousing alternative lifestyles and creative self-fulfillment . Renoir , on the other hand , came from a lower middle-class background as a porcelain painter . He was not a strident revolutionary . Still Life with Bouquet Renoir started mixing in different circles as he suddenly became close friends with these rebellious bohemian types . His early years as an artist were hard , and he benefited from his friends , who enjoyed financial support from their parents . From time to time , they all lived with Frédéric Bazille , who used the money from his parents to feed his penniless friends . Later on , as Renoir became more successful , he was commissioned to paint the portraits of the great and the good in Paris and invited to the "" salons "" of rich art collectors . His talent as an artist gave him access to the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy . For him , this was a major acknowledgement , and he relished it . But he never completely gave up his simple origins and lifestyle , preferring to stylize them instead . The Gypsy Girl ( Summer ) Artistically , Renoir joined his friends ' rebellion with gusto . His Impressionistic style , with his loose brushwork and pale palette , together with the everyday subjects that he painted , left his contemporaries reeling . But the form of his work was very traditional , on the whole : portraits , still life paintings , and landscapes . He also often referred to works from the Louvre , and alluded to academic artists such as Delacroix , Ingres , da Vinci , and Titian . Paul Meunier ( The Child in Velvet ) The exhibition offers a feast of outstanding paintings by Renoir for the general public to enjoy , with fantastic highlights from some of the major museum collections in Europe and the US . It 's truly spectacular , to be able to see so many masterpieces together . And then there is something special for aficionados , too . We will be showing the original 1867 painting "" Lise Holding a Bunch of Wild Flowers , "" which is part of a private collection and has n't been seen by the public since the 1920s . Woman with a Parasol in a Garden There was a moment , a year ago , when I was seriously worried about the whole concept of the exhibition . I got turned down for a few of the paintings , because Renoir is a popular artist , and important for lots of collections . That was a terrifying moment . But we turned the corner , and got the go-ahead for many really important works . Unfortunately , the reality is that whenever you 're preparing for an exhibition , there are lots of incredible pictures you have to do without , and you just have to be flexible in your detailed planning . That , in turn , gives you the scope to go in a new direction . The close and trusting working relationship with Marc Le Cœur . He opened up his family archive for us and contributed so much knowledge . That was tremendously valuable , because Renoir 's early work is very poorly documented . There are hardly any letters , so reliable sources are rare . We managed to get "" Woman with Parrot , 1871 "" from the Guggenheim Museum , which I 'm very proud of . Another favorite of mine is "" Paul Meunier ( The Child in Velvet ) , "" a portrait of Murer 's son , painted in 1877 . The innocent , gentle facial expression is very moving . I also really like the technique used to depict the texture of the fabric , and the way the little boy is all dressed up . Yes , it 's the philosophy of the museum and the director to identify a specific aspect of a well-known artist in order to provide new insights . Take any artist you may think you know , and you will see them in a whole new light . That 's definitely something I want to continue doing in the same way . The Kunstmuseum Basel is one of Switzerland 's oldest and most renowned art institutions . It therefore comes as no surprise that , after a five-year hiatus , Credit Suisse resumed its partnership with this illustrious museum in 2012 , agreeing support one special exhibition every year . The Kunstmuseum Basel collection focuses on paintings and drawings by artists from the Upper Rhine between 1400 and 1600 , as well as art from the 19th to the 21st century . The museum lays claim to the world 's largest collection of works by the Holbein family . Among the periods represented is the German Renaissance , with major works by Witz , Cranach , and Grünewald . Highlights from the 19th century include paintings by Böcklin , van Gogh , Gauguin and Cézanne . In the 20th century , the emphasis is on Cubism , German Expressionism , and American art since 1950 . Contemporary art is displayed at the Museum für Gegenwartskunst . Welcome to Viva Open a Viva Banking Package now and get a Ticketcorner Voucher worth CHF 50 .",human
"percent above trend in EM . China 's structural position has worsened since the 90 's and the growth of EM 's working age population has dropped to 1 percent from 2 percent in the 90 's . As a result , there is generally little spare capacity in EM labor markets . Strategically , EM should be bought when their currency and equity markets are cheap , if commodities are likely to outperform the cycle , and if they are addressing their fundamental problems such as excess private sector leverage and abnormally low levels of unemployment , Garthwaite said . "" Frankly , the way to address these two ( latter ) problems is to have a period of below trend growth . "" Tactically , there are currently only two buy signals : hedge fund exposure to EM , which dropped to a 3-year low in March ; and EM funds , whose outflows are close to a 12-year high . All other seven tactical indicators , including earnings momentum , relative economic momentum , EM government yields and price momentum , are neutral . In a nutshell , neither strategic nor tactical indicators currently speak in favor of buying EM . "" The market consensus is underestimating that not everything looks much better in EM than during the last EM crisis in the late ' 90s . Some individual countries may nevertheless be of interest , "" Garthwaite said . He singled out Taiwan ( the most interesting technically ) , China ( a cheap market , but with high risks ) , Korea , as well as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic ( CE3 ) . India ranks in the middle and is potentially the most interesting large market , as a commodity importer that has strong structural growth drivers , such as favorable demographics and a low rate of urbanization . India also ranks first in Credit Suisse 's EM consumer scorecard . Credit Suisse Research InstituteThe Emerging Consumer in 2014 : A Reversal of FortunesEmerging Consumer Survey : Download the 2014 ReportIndian Election Result Should n't Affect Economy Much Findings of the recent Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook indicate that the characteristics of EM have changed over the past 7 to 8 years . "" We 've seen far fewer EM crises in the last decade . EM have become less volatile related to developed markets ( DM ) and are more tightly correlated to each other as well as to DM . They 've become less risky , "" said Michael O'Sullivan , CIO UK & EEMEA for Credit Suisse 's Private Banking & Wealth Management division . The average volatility of returns is now close to 26 percent , down from 40 percent in 2000 . For those wanting to diversify a DM equity portfolio , Brazil , India and Russia have a relatively low correlation to DM . "" The strategies that tend to work best with EM - based on 120 years of data analyzed by Credit Suisse - are to buy on cheap valuations . The highest subsequent returns tend to be produced when dividend yields are high and price / earnings ratios ( P/ E ) low . The second best strategy is to buy EM on currency weakness or recent GDP weakness , "" O'Sullivan advised . "" Over the next decade , we 'll probably see EM commanding some small premium over DM . "" Latin American growth has disappointed , being closer to that of DM than EM , said Stefano Natella , Global Head of Equity Research for Credit Suisse 's Investment Banking division . "" The Achilles ' heal of the region is the under investment in both tangible infrastructure ( such as roads ) and intangible infrastructure ( such as innovation and human capital ) , "" Natella said . The region 's average total investment in infrastructure amounted to only 2 percent of GDP in the last decade , less than half of the minimum required to sustain growth of 4.5 percent . In recent years , Latin American countries have begun to address the issue by setting up long-term strategic plans to solve the lack of adequate infrastructure , Natella noted . At the same time , private consumption is booming in Latin America , particularly in Mexico and Brazil . "" Consumption has been driven by the rise of the middle-income class , which will represent more than two-fifths of the Latin American population by 2030 , up from just over a third in 2009 , "" he added . The formalization of the region 's economy , with more workers being registered , is another factor behind the strong consumption . The make-up of the emerging consumer differs markedly across countries and within them , said Richard Kersley , Head of Global Equity Research Product for Credit Suisse 's Investment Banking division , referring to findings from the bank 's annual Emerging Consumer Survey , which polls 16,000 people from the nine largest EM . "" The two largest markets , China and India are very different . China records a wide range of incomes , while India mostly has low-income consumers . The majority of EM consumers are still very poor , but the emergence of a middle class is worth underlining , with around 60 million households having entered this income bracket since the end of 2010 - mostly in Brazil , "" Kersley said . Furthermore , income growth expectations in rural communities now exceed those in urban communities . "" In India , car registrations are higher in rural areas than in urban , so is monthly expenditure on mobile connections , "" Kersley explained . EM consumers are also young . "" In a seven of the nine countries polled , the 18-29 year olds earn more than the 56-65 year olds , and these age groups spend their money differently , "" he added . Around half of the Frontier Market ( FM ) indices are made up of the Gulf States , a region where the risk appetite is very strong . "" The Gulf is the key driver behind this theme , "" Kersley said . "" FM are where EM were 20 years ago and offer that kind of growth trajectory going forward . As investors seek growth , FM become increasingly attractive , "" O'Sullivan added . "" But valuations are n't particularly attractive and liquidity is an issue in FM , "" he warned . Giles Keating , Head of Research for Private Banking & Wealth Management and Deputy Global Chief Investment Officer , moderated the conference call .",human
"then it is definitely sustainable . Matthias Lüfkens : Absolutely . Social media are here to stay . Right now , Facebook is approaching a billion followers . If it were a country , soon it would become the second-biggest country in the world , overtaking India . Even if it ultimately faces the same fate as MySpace , there will still be some other kind of social network to replace it . It 's going to be very , very difficult to isolate yourself from the new world of social networking . That 's why I , too , believe that social media are going to be around for a very long time . Matthias : First , companies have to change - really change - in terms of their attitude towards social media . They have to be part of it and play an active role . They must go in and create a community of friends , rather than just looking for potential clients . Basically , they have to become social in the true sense of the word . And they have to open up . That implies deciding who is allowed to speak for the company . Before , it was easy . Only the head of communications , the CEO and maybe the managing board were entitled to do that . Today , everybody is on the front line : From the person at the reception desk to middle management , everyone is becoming an unofficial spokesperson by being on Twitter or Facebook . Organizations need to train their staff , giving them insight into what it means to be social , and how best to deal with this new role of becoming a spokesperson . Matthias : Very important . It is not enough to say : "" Oh , yes , we 're on Twitter . But , we 're not active . We 're just monitoring . "" Companies must go beyond that . They should listen and respond . You ca n't just transform a press release into 140 characters . You have to engage your audience . For example , you can put your CEO and your managing board on Twitter . It gives them huge potential to speak directly to their audience - including employees and journalists - and gives the audience the chance to ask questions , to interact . Nick : By entering this world , if you are very high-profile , you potentially encourage people to speak more freely . But criticism is always out there . Tempting as it is for corporations or even individuals to pretend it does not exist , in fact , it does . The companies that embrace that criticism are actually the most successful . For example , in the travel industry . Take TripAdvisor . That 's something that initially would have led major hotel operators to say , "" This is terrible . There are people out there criticizing our hotels . "" But , the sum total of those voices is benefiting the whole industry . People have had to realize that you need to step up your game . No crisis is ever wasted as long as you listen to feedback and respond to it . Nick : When we first encouraged our journalists to step into social media , some would come back and say , "" There is no way I am engaging in this . How dare people have the temerity to criticize what I write ? "" We had to remind them that in daily work , we critique world leaders , CEOs and broadly , anyone making decisions . Today every single journalist at The Economist would say that the social media feedback they get has made their writing better . Corporations will find the same thing . Once they get over the initial shock that people are n't uniformly positive about everything , they 'll find opportunities to make their businesses better . Nick : Nike does this phenomenally well , for example . Or , take the pharmaceuticals industry . Because it is heavily-regulated and often target of criticism , it 's not an obvious candidate for social media . But companies like Johnson & Johnson have shown what can be done through YouTube , blogging and Twitter . Or , there 's the Zappos shoe business . Through social media they have succeeded in communicating that they are a customer service company , and built a billion-dollar business in less than 10 years . Most of the physical retail competitors in the US took 30 , 40 or 50 years to build a business of that size . Matthias : Yes . Oh , yes . Because , soon you will contact clients via Twitter . A great example is how the airline KLM contacted people using Twitter during volcanic eruptions that disrupted flights . They said : "" Follow us , we 'll follow you back "" and secured direct messaging and rebooked the clients . It will happen for banks . I 'm pretty sure I will soon be able to do online banking via Twitter . Matthias : The risk is in not doing it . Around the time I put the World Economic Forum on Facebook , there were lots of demonstrations against globalization in Zurich , Davos and Bern . I created the page and told myself , I ca n't possibly imagine anyone wanting to become friends with the WEF . But guess what ? There are now over 100,000 likes on that page . And in all these years there were maybe 10 or 20 negative comments . We 've opened up and invited discussion . And when it came , the discussion was very civil . You have to open up , especially , if you 're a public-facing institution . Matthias : Yes , because it 's open and Facebook is still kind of private . Twitter is my personal choice , it 's very powerful . You can do Twitter interviews : Every CEO has half an hour time per week just to answer a couple of questions . Before , you had to do that in a press conference . A great example is President Paul Kagame of Rwanda ( @PaulKagame ) who is one of the most conversational world leaders on Twitter . He personally chats with his Twitter followers . By contrast , François Hollande , France 's new president , just stopped tweeting on his personal account , abandoning over 400,000 followers after he was elected . That will kill him for the next elections , if he does n't reactivate that . Nick : We do . We have 1.1 million Facebook likes . We have 2.5 million Twitter followers . We make extensive use of YouTube , though we do n't produce that much video content . We use SlideShare . We have a massive Tumblr community , it 's been huge for us . LinkedIn we use , and Flickr . The one thing that we have not yet done is find a way to make the best-possible use of some regional social networks or some that are not what you might consider to be English-language networks . Matthias : YouTube was a great success . In 2006 , when I planned to put videos on YouTube , people said , "" Nobody will watch them . They were never meant to be viral . "" But we put them on and now , the World Economic Forum has two channels and in total 19,000 subscribers . YouTube is the second-biggest search engine on the Internet . If you 're not on YouTube , you do n't exist . Beyond that , we are on Facebook with over 100,000 likes , on Google+ with over a million , and Twitter with 1.6 million followers . When we started to have Twitter in Davos in 2008 , 23 people were tweeting out of 2,600 participants . This year , in fact 649 were active on the micro-blogging platform . Nick : Mobile will probably be a turbocharging mechanism . Mobile devices are in the hands of so many people on the planet , and it 's natural to use a mobile device socially . Mobile is inextricably social in its DNA .",human
"laughter . At age 30 , Abdul , an investment banker at Credit Suisse in London , is the very embodiment of the classic ideal of an Olympic athlete . An amateur who sacrifices himself both for his work and his sport , taking part in the Olympics would be the climax of a somewhat solitary sporting career . All the more so when the games are staged on the athlete 's veritable doorstep . Abdul Buhari : I am 30 years old , and I am a British discus thrower who has had an international career . My best throw was 65.44 meters , the fourth-best result in the history of English track and field athletics . I 've been in the "" business "" since 2003 . But discus throwing is not a job , it 's a passion . I love the magic that is at play when I make the discus fly . It 's a sort of Frisbee , but it weighs two kilograms - as heavy as a bag of potatoes . And I throw it halfway across a soccer pitch . It 's magnificent ! The diameter of the launch platform is only 2.5 meters and the throw takes less than five seconds . To achieve the best speed , you more or less have to run straight ahead on a circular area . Modern discus throwers are most definitely high-caliber performers - gone are the days when this sport was merely the preserve of athletes with fuller figures . The throw is divided into 25 movements . These are systematically analysed and varied in order to attain better lengths . That 's a strictly guarded secret ! Abdul was not always a successful discus thrower . At the outset , the pattern of his progress could best be described as one step forward and two steps back . As a teenager , he ran the 400 meters , but when he was injured ( not for the last time ) , he took up the discus while he was studying to graduate from high school . However , Abdul was too slight for his new discipline . Within a short time , he had to bulk up from 80 to over 100 kilograms , and today he weighs in at 126 kilos . Although he stands 1.98 meters tall , Abdul was plagued by another problem : "" I was too bashful . "" As soon as this giant stepped into the discus cage in front of a crowd of spectators , his self-confidence vanished . "" At my first international competition , I stepped into the circle , took a look around - and dropped the discus on the ground . "" Nevertheless , Abdul kept on making new attempts to face up to the situation he most feared : "" I simply could n't give up throwing the discus , so I had to learn how to cope with the public . "" Even today , his emotions sometimes get in the way , so he is perhaps the only Olympic athlete pleased about the restrictive ticketing policy of the London organizers . Abdul was n't allocated any admission tickets for his relatives , but he 's happy with that . "" If my family is present in the stadium , I only think about them . Are they all right ? Are they having a good time ? My performance would suffer as a result . "" After a long period when Abdul 's performance stagnated , he reached a turning point in 2008 - preceded by another setback . He missed qualifying for the Beijing Olympics by a mere 70 centimeters . In other words , the discus fell only 1 percent short of the mark . The reticent Englishman was shattered . Although he had only been working for Credit Suisse for one year , he summoned up all his courage and explained to his boss : "" If I want to move ahead in my sport , I ca n't carry on working full time . "" His superior was accommodating , even though the banking sector is not exactly world-famous for part-time work models . Abdul has worked 40 percent since then . And how did the clients react ? "" Many of them have become my fans , and some of them even attend my competitions . "" Abdul consulted the head of the trading floor at Credit Suisse , who taught him to build up his sporting career as if it were his own business . "" A good trader does n't see himself as a cog in a huge machine , but as an independent small business for which he shoulders all the responsibility . "" Abdul then deliberately took this advice as the watchword for his investments in his career as an athlete : He changed his coach and last year , the Muslim even gave up the fasting period . "" Ramadan coincided with the world championship , and I needed fuel in my tank , "" Abdul explains . He deploys his website and his Twitter account as marketing tools , and he knows his latest performance data inside out . "" Free-weight bench press with barbells 60 kilos ; bench press 210 kilos ; classic barbell squat 240 kilos . "" To achieve these figures , Abdul spends more on food and travel than on the mortgage for his house . He spends over 400 British pounds per month on meat alone . Every week he makes the three-hour journey to Loughborough , where the best possible training facilities are available to him . Abdul tells us that his wife , whom he married in 2010 , lends stability to his life . At 30 , Abdul has reached what is considered the best age for a discus thrower . The discus throw is definitely an event for older competitors . Al Oerter threw his personal best at 43 . Jürgen Schult was 40 when he made his last appearance at the Olympics and Lars Riedel ended his career at 41 . Jean-Pierre Egger , former holder of the Swiss discus record and long-standing trainer to Werner Günthör , Switzerland 's best shot-putter of all time , says that the advanced age of the throwers is explained by the demanding requirements of the discipline : "" You need at least ten years to master the technique and to build up the necessary strength . "" Abdul is set to reach the peak of his career in the near future . The investments in "" Buhari Ltd "" should pay dividends , after having his best year so far in 2011 . He increased his personal best distance to 65.44 meters , remained injury-free , and - the achievement that pleases him most of all - his throwing was consistent . These successes are all whetting his appetite for more . This perfect athlete intends to gain even more ground at the London Olympics . Is it all an illusion ? Abdul recently spent a weekend training with Jürgen Schult , holder of the oldest world record in men 's track and field ( 74.08 meters , thrown in 1986 ) . The legendary German discus thrower was very enthusiastic about Abdul 's technique , telling him , "" there 's no reason why you should n't win a medal in London . """,human
"status by the end of 2011 . As a potential EU candidate country since 2003 , Serbia formally applied for membership in 2009 . Domestically , the goal of EU membership has enjoyed broad political and popular support . According to a recent survey by Serbia 's official European Integration Office , 53 percent of citizens would support EU membership if a referendum were to be held in the near future . Even if the number of supporters declined from around 70 percent compared to five years ago , still only 24 percent would vote against the move . The belief that membership would be beneficial is predominant among Serbian people ( 43 percent versus 23 percent ) and far more prevalent in comparison to Croatia , where a recent Eurobarometer survey indicated that just 27 percent of respondents regarded EU membership as beneficial . Between 2000 and 2008 , Serbia 's real GDP expanded on average by more than 5 percent annually , mainly driven by the non-tradable sectors . As a consequence , a wide current account deficit emerged , essentially due to the external trade imbalance . The deficit was financed by capital inflows and to a large extent foreign direct investment . As the global economic crisis hit in 2008 , Serbia 's growth model proved to be unsustainable . The large imbalance between the internal and external sector led the current account deficit to widen further , reaching 20 percent of GDP by the end of 2008 . The large downside risks prompted a Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in January 2009 , which initiated a structural transformation of the economy from consumption-driven to export-led growth . So far , these reforms have been partly successful . In 2010 , Serbia 's GDP grew by 1.8 percent , driven to a large extent by external demand . The IMF forecasts further GDP growth of 3 percent in 2011 and at least 5 percent in 2012 . Nevertheless , high inflation and elevated unemployment are continuing to weigh on domestic demand . Additionally , the recent surge in portfolio inflows has put appreciation pressure on the Serbian Dinar , thus threatening Serbia 's competitiveness in an export-led recovery phase . Given the structure of the Serbian economy , there is good reason for both the government and the business sector to equate EU membership with prosperity . The future success of Serbia 's economy is directly linked to export growth and crucially dependant on facilitated access to the European market . In addition , the prospect of EU integration creates the foundation for the development of more mature financial markets . The strong performance of the Serbian equity market has recently drawn the attention of investors . With a return of over 40 percent between January 2001 and June 2011 , the MSCI Serbia has outperformed most regional peers as well as the MSCI Frontier Market index , of which it is a constituent . Cross-border acquisitions may provide an incentive for local companies to list on the local stock market , which is still characterized by low liquidity and high volatility .",human
"have a surprisingly big impact - by buying stocks that trade every hour , say , as opposed to every minute . It could be both . You can create a risk factor from a liquidity premium . But I am rather thinking of something I call a "" popularity "" premium . The stocks that trade the most are the most popular . And those are the ones where there is mispricing because they get to be "" too "" popular , as measured for example by their heavy trading . Interestingly , our measures of stocks that trade less show lower volatility . So these stocks do n't really seem more risky . Therefore I do n't really like calling the extra return a risk premium . Well , first of all , bond markets are in the fortunate position of having yields to maturity that you can actually see . You know that if the bond does n't default , you 're going to get a specific return in that particular currency . And you know it in advance . In the equity market , you ca n't see the forward returns in the same way . You only see the result . And since returns themselves are very volatile , it 's hard to discern what the result really is . I 'm sure there is irrational behavior in the bond market , too . But yes , there is behavior in the equity market where essentially people are attracted to stocks that trade a lot . And they 'll pay more for them , just as you would do with brands in the consumer market . Consequently , the return structure is going to be different among the less popular and the more popular , and that leads to mispricing . Of course , you 're also going to see mispricings in the bond market , but they may be smaller and more visible , thus easier to take advantage of . In the equity markets , you can tell stories about the stock . And the stories can be very interesting . And you can pay a lot for them . There is more information in the bond market . It 's much more mathematical . The spreads are visible . People need a certain amount of liquidity . If you 're going to have a lot of illiquid assets , you also need some liquid assets to meet your liquidity needs . There 's a danger in going into too many illiquid assets , like real estate and infrastructure and private equity . Some of the universities , for example , did get into a bit of a squeeze in the financial crisis . They could not get very good prices for their private equity investments . One of the benefits of the kinds of stocks I 've been talking about is that they can easily be sold in any crisis without paying much of a discount at all . That 's an interesting argument . And , of course , there is evidence that overall stock market trends go in the opposite direction of what retail investors do : retail tends to sell after the crash and buy after the rise . So if retail investors were somehow prevented from overtrading , they might perform better . But the truth is that people want liquidity even though it sometimes leads them to take the wrong actions .",human
"composers wrote in this new and perhaps more complex way is that they wanted to express their emotions and not just calculation . The function of the music and its theoretical background is to simply communicate these complex feelings , which are feelings and emotions that we all have and share . The first piece is by Charles Ives ( Sonata No 2 for Piano , Concord , Mass . , 1840 - 60 ) , which has not been played much in concerts , as it is practically unplayable ! He is one of the first composers who experimented with things such as two or three rhythms at the same time , using different tonalities simultaneously , mixing complex tonal languages with very simple ones . He uses a lot of influences from other genres , ranging from pop music from his own time to Beethoven 's fifth symphony and he integrates it all into one language . Ralph van Raat The second work is from John Cage ( Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano ) and it is a landmark work in 20th century repertoire . In this work he tries to bring together the Eastern and Western world , and he does this with a very special method . He prepared the piano with adding metal objects into the strings of the piano to alter the sounds , which gives a very eastern percussion like sound . He also used elements and the philosophy of Indian music and then at other times he can use very common Western sounds and tonality . In every piece of that cycle there is one emotion that is pivotal to the piece and each emotion is derived from the nine permanent emotions in ancient Indian culture , such as anger , fear , love , jealousy . In every piece he tried to translate one of those emotions into the music and in fact also uses silence as part of his ensemble . Silence is a typical element in a lot of non-Western music , in particular the role of silence and meditation . So in general this music is very quiet and can evoke a lot of emotions . When I look at the other artists in the series it is very inspiring to be in such company ! They are all very good musicians and I am really happy and honored to be part of the series . What I am excited about the most though is that I am performing contemporary 20th century music , which is not a typical repertoire that allows artists to be involved in this kind of international series . So I am really happy that this repertoire has been given a platform to bring it to new audiences . I have a very hectic program ! A few to mention is the forthcoming tour with Tan Dun 's The Banquet ( Piano Concerto ) conducted by Tan Dun himself , a performance of George Gershwin 's Concerto in F with the Cairo Philharmonic , performances and CD recordings of Tauno Marttinen 's Piano Concerto with the Finnish Turku Symphony Orchestra and a recital performance at the Bach Festival of Thüringen in Germany to name just a few .

"Irish economy has been suffering since the collapse of a property bubble in 2008 led to a severe banking crisis . But there have been signs this year that capital markets and investors are gaining confidence in the Emerald Isle . The government sold 5 billion euros of 10-year of new benchmark bonds for the first time in three years earlier this month and sold the state-owned insurance company Irish Life to a Canadian firm in February . The same month , the government restructured 25 billion euros of short-term promissory notes issued during the crisis . Ireland needs to create jobs to replace those lost in construction after the real estate market collapsed , Credit Suisse analyst Steven Bryce wrote in a recent note entitled "" The Bonds are Back in Town . "" But unlike some other European countries , Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem . In fact , Ireland 's export prices fell relative to the rest of the Eurozone even through the boom years of the mid-2000s , Bryce noted . Moody 's , one of three major ratings agencies , recently praised the country 's competitive exports when it affirmed Ireland 's credit rating . But the rating Moody 's affirmed was still just below investment grade with a negative outlook . The agency said "" Ireland 's vulnerability to wider euro-area stresses has been reaffirmed by euro area policymakers ' handling of the Cyprus crisis . "" It also cited continuing weaknesses in the country 's banking sector . Credit Suisse economists and analysts have said that , if there were to be any "" Cyprus contagion , "" it would most likely spread through European banks experiencing a rise in their borrowing costs . Bank funding costs have already risen sharply in countries with large banking sectors relative to the size of their economies - both in peripheral countries such as Italy and Spain and in core countries such as France and the Netherlands , Hill 's note pointed out . As for Ireland , its banking sector remains troubled . But there is reason to believe markets may not get overly twitchy about it just yet . "" Ireland is already under a bailout program , and has seen substantial declines in the scale of deposits since the start of the financial crisis , "" Bryce wrote . "" To some extent , this means that the cost-benefit analysis of repeating ( a bail-in ) in Ireland would probably produce a markedly different outcome than in Cyprus . "" As a percentage of GDP , the portion of Ireland 's banking sector insured by the government has shrunk by 20 percent since the crisis began in 2008 , but is still twice the size of the economy . A large number of homeowners have fallen behind on mortgage payments , and 15 percent of Irish mortgages , by value , are in arrears . However , Bryce also noted that post-crisis Irish banks are among the best capitalized in Europe , and the Irish central bank is pushing private banks to help struggling homeowners by extending the length of their loans , thus lowering the monthly bill , or allowing interest-only payments for a time . Perhaps the most important threat to Ireland , then , is in the post-Cyprus slowdown expected in Europe . "" There 's a clear risk that despite Cyprus ' small share of GDP , the precedents raised by the nature of its bailout and the shock to confidence because of how it was implemented means that the prospect for growth in the euro area once again deteriorates , "" Hill wrote in a recent note entitled "" European Economics : After Cyprus . "" Growth and stability , Credit Suisse analysts have said , are precisely what Ireland needs most , particularly in the EU , which absorbs about 60 percent of Ireland 's exports . Ireland 's large budget gap , expected to be 7.5 percent this year , is a serious concern as well , Credit Suisse analysts say . The deficit is one of the worst in the EU and austerity measures are probably necessary for at least the next three years to bring it down . But at the same time , the economy likely needs to grow by 2 percent a year to keep debt levels sustainable , Credit Suisse has said . "" Ireland is incredibly vulnerable to shocks in the near term , "" Bryce wrote in his research note . "" Any shocks to growth or events that delay fiscal consolidation could seriously threaten the Irish recovery . "" So , while Ireland may have more reasons than its fellow periphery nations to be optimistic , the country will likely join its counterparts in the region in watching closely for signs of Cyprus contagion .",human
". Looking at past cyclical downturns , the reactions of investment spending are typically more immediate and pronounced than those of private consumption . This pattern is likely going to be repeated , but probably in a less pronounced manner than in the case of global recessions . However , UK domestic demand will likely slow down , in our view , and even contract for a few quarters . The longer-term impact on the UK is highly dependent on future economic relations with the EU , but will most likely be negative as well , with potentially reduced trade access and labor market mobility weighing on investment , productivity and income . As regards the impact of Brexit on other major economies , we examine three main potential channels : 1 ) trade , 2 ) confidence , and 3 ) financial contagion . The UK is the world 's fifth largest importer , absorbing roughly 4 percent of world trade , and it is running a trade deficit which amounted to 7 percent of GDP last year . As a consequence of Brexit and the weaker GBP , we would expect overall UK import volumes to stagnate in the second half of the year , and to decline around 2 percent year-on-year in 2017 . The corresponding value of exports to the UK would probably drop even more , as most exporters would have to make price concessions due to the weaker GBP . This was also the case in the 2008-2009 recession . UK import volumes fell 15 percent , but the top ten trading partners suffered export declines to the UK ranging from 14 percent ( China ) to 31 percent ( Spain ) in local currency terms . While the magnitude of the declines would be less in the upcoming downturn , we would assume the country pattern would be similar to the last recession . Therefore , the "" Brexit drag "" on China and the USA is likely to turn out to be negligible . Both countries ' exports appear less vulnerable to a downturn in the UK and a weak GBP . In addition , exports to the UK only represent 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent of their GDP , respectively . In Europe , Ireland and Norway both have a significant trade exposure to the UK . However , Ireland mainly exports relatively inelastic pharmaceutical , food and agriculture products to the UK , and its nominal exports were thus among the less affected in the last recession . Norway 's mineral fuel exports are probably even more shielded from demand and currency effects ; the steep decline in the last recession mainly reflected the drop in commodity prices . All other European trading partners are likely to suffer more , and we would not be surprised to see export declines reaching the 5-10 percent range in countries such as Spain , Italy and France next year , though uncertainty surrounding such estimates is considerable . Even then , however , the direct negative effects on GDP of the European trading partners is likely to remain mild , and would probably fall within the 0.1-0.3 percentage points range , in our view . A second and potentially very powerful channel of contagion is via consumer and business confidence . Indeed , uncertainty over the longer-term prospects of the European Union are likely to increase with Brexit , although we think the view that Brexit marks the beginning of a disintegration of the EU is highly exaggerated . Conversely , it seems rather unrealistic to believe that the Brexit shock will lead to enhanced cohesion among the 27 remaining states . On balance , business sentiment and thus investment could be dampened due to this political development . Consumer sentiment might then also suffer in response to weaker corporate spending . Nevertheless , the question remains by how much policy uncertainty will effectively rise outside the UK as a result of the Brexit vote , and how strongly that will affect economic sentiment . It seems unlikely to us that countries outside Europe would be much affected . But even within Europe , policy uncertainty has only a limited effect on economic sentiment . A third channel by which the Brexit vote could impact the European economy , in particular , is via financial contagion . The Brexit vote has raised concerns that financial conditions might worsen in the European periphery . So far , the verdict in this regard is not clear : On the one hand , yield spreads of Italian and Spanish government bonds over those of Germany are back to pre-Brexit vote levels , after initially widening to some extent . In our view , this indicates that the markets believe in the ECB 's determination and ability to prevent a renewed sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone . At the same time , refinancing conditions of many European banks have worsened sharply since the Brexit vote , with prices of their stocks and bonds dropping sharply . Concerns about a weakening economic outlook , as well as lower yields and a flatter yield curve , which constrain the banks ' ability to generate revenues and thus weigh on profitability , were the likely causes . This has especially increased the market 's focus on Italian banks which carry large amounts of non-performing loans on their books , in a situation in which the rules of the newly launched European Banking Union severely limit the ability of governments to provide support to banks . Such stresses are likely to further restrain the lending activity of banks in Italy , and possibly elsewhere . At the same time , leverage in the banking system has , in our view , been reduced sufficiently to prevent a renewed financial crisis in the Eurozone . Overall , however , tighter financial conditions are likely to continue to imply sub-par investment and growth in the Eurozone periphery , as has been the case in past years . To summarize , we think that the Brexit vote mainly has negative consequences for the UK economy , whereas spillovers - primarily via trade , confidence and financial conditions - are likely to be contained elsewhere . Nevertheless , recent developments regarding the European banking sector are a cause for concern , and need to be closely monitored going forward . Even if the impact of each channel in isolation might not be particularly large , the sum might still represent a non-negligible drag on the European economy , in particular . We have therefore maintained our 2016 growth forecasts at current levels , in spite of the more positive data prints before the Brexit vote , but have slightly downgraded our 2017 forecasts . More negative scenarios would come into play over the longer term if political fragmentation risks increase in the EU more severely , contrary to our assumption .",human
"sales in some areas - a rate of decline that was only slightly weaker than that seen in 2015 . Within non-food retailing , the situation became increasingly difficult for clothing and footwear retailers , whose sales decreased once again . Shopping tourism , which has a heavy impact on the industry , stabilized at a very high level in 2016 , judging from VAT receipts at Swiss border posts . Although cross-border , brick-and-mortar shopping seems to have fallen slightly ( - 6.2 percent compared to 2015 ) , the e-commerce portion continued to enjoy strong growth momentum . All in all , one in every ten Swiss francs in the retail sector is likely to have been spent abroad in 2016 . As a whole , nominal sales for the retail sector are expected to flatline in 2017 , which amounts to a stabilization after the weakness of the last few years . The absence of a significant growth impetus from the general economy precludes a more dynamic recovery . Given a stagnating unemployment rate , the best-case scenario is a very gradual recovery in consumer sentiment for 2017 . Since inflation is likely to make a comeback in Switzerland in 2017 , consumer spending power is unlikely to increase much despite a slight uptick in nominal salaries . Provided the Swiss franc does not experience another significant bout of appreciation against the euro , offline shopping abroad by Swiss residents is also unlikely to increase further in 2017 but will , at most , decline only slightly . Real demand will therefore increase slightly in 2017 , primarily thanks to population growth . Retail prices are nevertheless likely to decrease again in 2017 , following on from previous years . In light of the subdued sector outlook , the retail space expansion plans for 2017 are more defensive than they have been since 2009 , though the plans of food retailers are more aggressive those of non-food retailers . Slightly higher demand in real terms will primarily benefit retailers in the food / near-food segment . In addition , they should be more or less able to maintain prices in 2017 , compared to the previous year . Prices in the non-food segment , on the other hand , are likely to keep dropping in 2017 , too . Nominal sales in food retail are likely to grow slightly , whereas the non-food segment will continue to face declining sales - albeit at a slower rate than in 2016 . Burgeoning e-commerce is one key factor behind the current , challenging situation facing many brick-and-mortar , non-food retailers . Swiss consumers made online purchases worth an estimated CHF 7.5 billion in 2015 , i.e. around 5 percent of total retail sales . In the last seven years , e-commerce has seen impressive annual growth of 6.4 percent , and this growth is likely to continue at a dynamic rate in the future . In its latest online retail forecast , Credit Suisse anticipates that e-commerce will nearly double its share of retail sales to more than 10 percent over the next five years . By 2022 , e-commerce is likely to account for a considerable share of total sales in the clothing and home electronics segments , in particular ( 27 percent and 38 percent , respectively ) . The special focus of this year 's study is the regional supply density in brick-and-mortar retailing . It is above average in Switzerland 's main cities and urban areas . By contrast , rural areas other than the main tourist destinations have a below-average supply density . The relationship between supply ( measured in FTEs ) and demand in brick-and-mortar retailing declined in a large number of regions between 2011 and 2013 . Retail employment declined in most major city centers , with a few exceptions , such as Lucerne ; this compares with an expansion of jobs in some of the outer districts . The development of rents for retail property at prime locations was one of the main factors behind the decline in employment in the city centers . A regional analysis of the supply density also shows the impact of the sharp rise in shopping tourism back in 2011 . Retailers in municipalities bordering Germany and France saw a 5.4 percent and 3.4 percent reduction in full-time equivalents ( respectively ) in 2013 compared with 2011 - and the city of Basel , as much as 6.6 percent . Across Switzerland as a whole , there was a 2.1 percent decline . The rise in shopping tourism following the Swiss franc 's rise in value in 2010/2011 accordingly had a disproportionately heavy impact on retailers in the Basel region , in particular .",human
"'s leaders and many foreign banks are confident that 2013 will bring an investment-grade credit rating . "" I think people had sort of forgotten about the Philippines … they fell off the radar because governance problems and political instability masked their assets , such as untapped mining resources and a youthful population , "" Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai said . Sathirathai noted that average annual foreign direct investment in the Philippines was only$ 2 billion or less for the past five years . "" Now ( the Philippines ) are back on the map , I think that the impact of investor visibility could be significant , "" he said . Progress has come on several fronts . The government has signed a preliminary peace agreement with Muslim rebels , which could end a long insurgency and improve the investment climate . While previous President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has battled several corruption charges , current leader Benigno Aquino III has vowed to crack down on such abuses , encouraging investor confidence . The Philippines , which has many English speakers and a focus on services such as business process outsourcing , has a new opportunity to compete with China for manufacturing jobs amid rising Chinese labor costs . Last year , as a territorial dispute between Japan and China sparked anti-Japanese protests in China , Japanese investment rose more than 10 percent via the Philippine Economic Zone Authority , which promotes investment in export-producing industries . Many Japanese companies are expanding their presence in the Philippines - Canon Business Machines Inc . , for example , is at work on a plant to build laser printers . Meanwhile , the government is pushing public-private partnerships to improve or expand expressways , airports and schools , while real estate developers are targeting a growing middle class and wealthy Filipinos eyeing prestige properties . Developer Century Properties Group is at work on several such projects , including the Trump Tower Manila and a residence conceived with Philippe Starck 's residential design company . Yet the Philippines , coming from so far behind many of its neighbors , faces big challenges ahead . Though the government is working on infrastructure , there are still deterrents for business people , such as worn-out airports and poor telecommunications , says J. Alfonso de Dios , a Filipino who has companies both in China and his home country . De Dios , whose TVCXpress Manila sends digitized TV commercials and program content to local TV stations via exclusive broadband lines within the Philippines , says the country 's Internet infrastructure is not designed with wide bandwidths to accommodate large files . He says that it would actually be much cheaper to send the video packages his company produces from his Philippines office to a neighboring country with stronger bandwidth , and then back to his clients in the Philippines . Tourism is another area where the country could stand to ramp up infrastructure . While the Philippines boasts thousands of islands and some of the world 's most beautiful beaches , less than 2 percent of GDP revenue comes from tourism , compared to 7 or 8 percent in Thailand or Malaysia , Credit Suisse 's Sathirathai said . The country is pushing a new tourism campaign with the slogan , "" It 's More Fun in the Philippines , "" and a big casino complex is set to open in Manila Bay . Bill Barnett , the managing director of tourism consultancy and research company C9 Hotelworks , questions whether casinos are enough , and says it might be wise to diversify with theme parks or other attractions for middle-class , multi-generational Asian families . The Philippines - which , like Japan , is in the midst of a territorial dispute with China - also needs to lure tourists from China , who prefer Thailand and Indonesia , Barnett said . The country is betting big on gaming , and if the Chinese do n't come , who will ? "" The attitude toward the Chinese needs to be , ' Let 's kiss and make up - and by the way , please come visit , ' "" he said .",human
"the garment , which enables you to track the path of the garment from production to the retail store , and shows you that you bought a brand product and not a fake . An additional benefit is you can easily retrieve it if you misplace it . Nowadays , the compatibility of technology and fashion provides more food for thought and a vision for the future spanning from e-retail through e-textiles or smart fabrics to 3D printing . Computer design is already being used in the production of clothing , and prototypes of 3D-printed fashion can be seen at fashion shows or in online videos . E-commerce is already effectively in place , but could experience another boost . Replacement items such as underwear and jeans are already being bought via the Internet , mainly driven by cheaper prices and , to a lesser extent , shopping time saved . It is an easy process , especially if you know your size . But imagine you have a specific brand in mind , or are even thinking about having something tailor-made . The future holds a solution : Have your body scanned and use the measurements when visiting the virtual retail store online . The items you purchase will then be sent straight to your door . A pioneer in innovative biorobotics and the virtual fitting room is Fits.me , founded in 2010 and acquired by Rakuten Inc . ( a global leader in e-commerce ) in July 2015 . The company is receiving lots of publicity these days after launching a partnership with the retailer Hawes & Curtis . Its virtual fitting room helps to solve the single biggest problem for apparel e-commerce , i.e. that consumers cannot try the clothes on before they buy them . The site 's shape-shifting robotic mannequin takes your body measurements and mimics your shape so that you can see exactly how clothing would fit you . The site has been such a success that clothing sales at online German retailer Quelle increased by three times , and the number of clothing returns fell by 28 percent . Another revolutionary development is e-textiles , also known as smart garments or fabrics , which enable digital components to be embedded in them to provide added value to the wearer . In an article on Forbes.com dated 7 May 2014 , on the future of fabric , author Rebecca Gaddis quoted Rebeccah Pailes-Friedman of the Pratt Institute as saying that "" what makes smart fabrics revolutionary is that they have the ability to do many things that traditional fabrics cannot , including communicate , transform , conduct energy and even grow . "" One example is therapeutic textiles . Skin is the only organ of the body that comes directly in contact with garments . Since clothes stay in contact with the skin for the longest time , developing fabrics that can heal or protect the skin or even the body would add more value to them . Therapeutic textiles provide new approaches and are slowly gaining importance because of their many benefits and positive results . A coating of herbal extracts on the fabric can provide a remedial value . These fabrics play an important role in relieving stress , rejuvenating or curing skin ailments , and can even help you sleep better . Your underwear is an integral part of your wardrobe , and you are probably very selective when you buy it . In the future , you will become even more selective once you learn what your underwear and other garments can do for you in addition to making you feel comfortable and well dressed . One day , instead of looking into the mirror , you will be able to ask your clothes how you feel . For example , your underwear may tell you if you are coming down with something before you know it yourself , or notify others if you have fallen over or help doctors diagnose and treat illnesses . The next generation of wearable technology aims to embed sensors in your clothes so that you only need to get dressed to start monitoring your health . The functions required for personal health have a strong overlap with those of sports and sports training . In general , the idea is that information on the wearers ' physiology , e.g. heart rates , respiration rates , body temperature , biochemistry and activities are recorded and stored or continuously transmitted to a clinic in order to help monitor their health . In this way , people with long-term health issues can work on gradually improving their health . Other people with chronic illnesses could stay at home instead of in hospital , but still have high-quality health supervision . How does it work ? Smart fibers with sensors are knitted straight into the fabrics . With conductive or optical sensors woven into T-shirts , shorts and underwear , smart clothes will be able to pick up a greater range of body signals at much higher sensitivities than rigid sensors , such as clip-on sensors or wristbands . In the future , technology will change the way we perceive fashion and the way we shop . The sooner we grow accustomed to these innovations and inventions the better . But never fear - at the end of the day we will presumably continue to wear fashionable clothes - just from different materials .",human
"Moreover , a low burden of debt gave the federal government a certain amount of latitude , which was put to good use particularly on the cantonal and municipal level . Overall , Switzerland 's economic output increased by about 1 percent last year . This year , economic growth may even increase its pace somewhat . Exports may experience the biggest acceleration of all demand components . According to forecasts by Credit Suisse Economic Research , export volume this year will increase by 4 percent following stagnation last year . First , a moderately better demand situation abroad is likely to act as a stimulus to export sales . Second , the SNB is likely to continue successfully defending the lower limit set for the euro exchange rate . However , this may combine with the higher inflation seen abroad to trigger steady real depreciation in the Swiss franc . Ultimately , costs will rise more gradually for Swiss-based companies than for their competitors abroad , while the euro exchange rate will remain constant at around 1.20 Swiss francs . Furthermore , Swiss exporters are increasingly likely to turn their attention away from crisis-hit Europe toward dynamically growing regions of the world - specifically Asia . It would be unrealistic , however , to expect a complete decoupling from Europe , because of the close interconnections between the economic regions . This will combine with the still overvalued price of the Swiss franc to mute any recovery in exports that occurs this year . Capital expenditure is also likely to experience a slight acceleration . For expenditures on equipment , Economic Research expects growth of 3 percent this year following 2 percent the previous year . The low interest rate environment , which is expected to remain in place until at least the end of the year , will provide fertile ground for the expected growth in capital expenditure . On the other hand , numerous uncertainties , as well as below-average rates of capacity utilization , continue to restrain companies ' capital expenditures . Experts anticipate that construction investment will show growth of 2 percent compared to a drop by the same percentage last year . The reversal in construction investment suggested by this change from negative to positive is probably a temporary rather than a real effect . Revenues in the construction industry have been volatile for a number of years now , although the trend remains upward . The fall in revenues in 2012 was attributable to a combination of the cold spell at the start of the year and capacity bottlenecks in execution . It was not possible to recoup these revenue losses over the course of the year and continue the extremely dynamic growth of the year immediately preceding . While the high demand for housing and the many residences already under construction suggest there is further potential for growth over the medium term , the volatile revenue trend indicates that the industry is reaching its upper limit for growth . Private consumption will probably remain a key pillar for economic growth . However , forecasts suggest that the extreme dynamism of 2012 will not be repeated - after 2 percent last year , Economic Research is expecting an increase of 1.5 percent in 2013 . The slight weakening in growth is due to marginal downturns in various factors underlying the growth in consumption , among other things . First , 2013 immigration rates may decline slightly from the previous year . Second , the rate of unemployment may increase slightly , according to assessments by Economic Research . Third , inflation , once again creeping upward , may completely cancel out the modest gain in nominal wages , expected to come in at just under 1 percent . Moreover , in response to dropping prices , consumers may already have made some of the purchases in the previous year that they planned for this year . This premature demand may now "" take away "" from demand in 2013 . However , if the exchange rate remains stable , shopping tourism may not worsen . The government may also increase its consumer spending less sharply than in the previous year . The predicted slowdown in growth from 2 percent the previous year to 1.5 percent in 2013 is not objectionable . Although government can be a welcome stabilizing factor in times of difficulty , an expanding public sector tends to be detrimental to competitiveness over the long term . The era of falling prices is over . The favorable import prices due to the strong Swiss franc have been passed on , at least to some extent . According to a study by the Federal Department of Economic Affairs , roughly 40 percent of the "" euro bonus "" reached end customers . The fact that it was passed on is also the main reason why prices reached a level in 2012 that was decidedly below that of the preceding year . Experience shows that price advantages due to the exchange rate are passed on within three to four quarters . Because the Swiss franc has not increased in value for almost one and a half years as a result of the euro exchange limit set at 1.20 , no further euro bonus can be expected going forward . Even if inflation rates are on the plus side , the mild inflation conditions may remain in place for quite a while longer . Economic Research therefore predicts an average inflation rate of 0.4 percent for 2013 .",human
"has to do with the inflation pressure we already experience in the emerging markets such as China or India . Fears of interest rate hikes can also function as a drag on the emerging markets on a temporary basis . But from a structural standpoint , we 're extremely convinced that the emerging market story is definitely not over , as so many structural advantages will lead to a strategic outperformance . Our recommendation would be to buy into phases of neutral or underperformance of the emerging markets . Definitely by a broad-based approach . We should not talk only about emerging market equities . Given the constructive cycle we are in , equities are definitely the place to be , but we should not forget emerging market debt and . local currencies . Structural advantages such as healthy ratios of debt to GDP , visible foreign currency reserves , fewer banking problems and visible demographic advantages will lead to a strategic outperformance . No , definitely not . When we go for investments into emerging market equities and bonds , we want to give the clear recommendation also to focus on local currencies , because all the structural advantages just described . When we talk about our benchmark exposure , we are already at an emerging market quota of more than 10 percent . In normal market cycles , we can easily recommend to go for 20 percent emerging market exposure . I would definitely not talk about a bubble in the emerging markets nor about overheating , because there are clear structural elements underpinning the emerging market story . Of course , it could be that with regard to capital flows , this will be a crowded trade for a while . But what 's extremely important is that more and more strategic investors are coming to the table . This means that the money is not so fast flowing in and out . Given the fact that many investors now are strategically oriented , this means they are also integrating the emerging markets into the benchmark . We clearly expect that volatility in the emerging markets will be lower compared to the past . So in a broad-based comparison , we expect that the risk return ratio of emerging market investments will further improve in the future . We are also positive on commodities , because of the current stage of the cycle we are in. We made a strong call to buy real assets such as commodities , given the fact that we are now on a normalization path from a macroeconomic standpoint.The pendulum is swinging away from deflation threats to reflation and then to inflation . We are quite confident that there will be an outperformance of real assets in next decade . So we are structurally positive on commodities and would recommend taking every opportunity in phases of weakness , to extend or to increase exposure into commodities such as industrial metals , soft commodities , energy and precious metals .",human
"company - now a subsidiary - focused on the military and civilian aeronautics markets , building on its expertise in circuit boards and the technologies it already mastered . Extensive PR work and a significant investment in time were necessary to pass the EN9100 quality audits for aerospace companies and to land the first contracts . With the success of this new strategy , CES gradually moved away from the core activities of its parent company , which agreed to sell the subsidiary in 2011 . The sale of CES 's capital was completed in 2012 to three Swiss financial investors : SVC - Ltd . for Risk Capital for SMEs , Vinci Capital Switzerland SA , and Capital Transmission SA . Today , CES SA offers two major product lines . First , its standard circuit boards are exceptionally high-performing components . The company handles the design , manufacture and assembly of processor , interface , network , and graphics boards . Second , these boards can also be assembled to create complete systems . CES offers different types of systems , including flight computers , which must pass the highest level of security and reliability for flight data controls , and mission computers , which are connected to sensors handling a specific role , such as collecting photos or video . These various technologies are installed on board of both civil and military aircrafts . As for the signal-processing subsystems produced by CES , they are primarily used to equip airports or borders with surveillance radar . In order to recruit the qualified employees essential to its development , the company maintains close relationships with universities and specialty schools of higher education throughout the region . Three-quarters of the close to one hundred employees have a higher technical engineering education background , including many with doctorates . In addition , the company takes five to six interns on board each year for extensive engineering and technical training . However , maintaining the research and development team in Switzerland has a considerable cost . Yet , the proximity of the schools , the Swiss quality image , the historic links with CERN , and Switzerland 's political neutrality and stability all speak in favor of the company 's headquarters in the Geneva region . With employees of close to 20 different nationalities , the company offers an extremely multicultural environment . CES-technology is what drives employees to expand the company 's market share in the face of US competitors that are often ten times the size of the company from Lancy . CES exports 100 percent of its products , and was recently negatively impacted by the difficult economic conditions that led to a decline in its clients ' activities . The company is in contact with Armasuisse , the authority mandated by the Swiss Federal Department of Defense , Civil Protection and Sports with the procurement and replacement of the F-5 Tiger . However , the political situation in Switzerland represents an additional element of uncertainty for such large projects , restricting this unique opportunity for Swiss industry . For all that , the global market is huge and CES has the potential for market share growth . Strong growth is expected in certain aeronautics sectors , like ISR ( Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ) . Beyond these challenges , CES is still confident in its know-how and its 100 percent Swiss solutions , thus ensuring that its name will always be associated with reputable clients and projects .",human
"cultural differences also present us with the opportunity to learn from each other . China has achieved great growth in the past 10 years but we are still considered a developing country . I hope my generation can bring the country to a higher level . It should be our mission and responsibility . This is different from my father 's generation : in his era , the focus was on finding a better life , feeding the family , getting support . Now things have changed and we need to change China 's image . China is already doing very well , even if the economy is slowing down . It realizes that it needs to adjust its speed of growth and maintain a balance between domestic reform inside and outside the country . It is , however , not easy for the Chinese government with a population of 1.3 billion - that 's a lot of people to feed and provide jobs for . But we are on the right track , we just have to be patient . Unlike other entrepreneurs who started and grew their own businesses , I am very lucky that my father created such a large empire . What works for me , especially at my age , is being confident and believing in myself . I do face a lot of challenges and sacrifice a lot to be in this position . For example , I do n't have much time to go to parties or do things with my friends , but I do gain a lot going from one meeting to another and speaking with different people . That 's another way of learning and demonstrates that sometimes sacrifice is a gift in disguise . Defining myself . That 's something I need to do more : I sometimes get lost in which direction I want to go and find it hard to decide what is the right thing for me to do at my age . The challenge is really more of an internal process , rather than from the enterprise , having to make decisions , or the challenges that other people put to me . People do try to influence you , for example the media , but you need to focus on yourself rather than other people . I believe that once you have the ability to help others you should do so . Even though it 's a small amount for me , it is a lot for the students I support . I want to give a gift whereby I see benefits . I am not comfortable with simply writing a check to a foundation and forgetting about it , that 's not the way I do things . I meet up with a group of 30-40 students once every semester . We talk about their careers , their goals , role models and their daily difficulties . Right now , my foundation does this with Zhejiang University . My vision is to have the foundation support more people and expand it to cover around 100 students . The Foundation has already helped a lot of people and I want to help change the way people think about charity in China : I want to influence other people to get involved personally rather than just writing a check . I was educated in the US and I notice a big difference between the systems there and in China . Chinese education is more focused on how to pass exams , which is not enough . In the US , education is more about helping students find their own ideas - this is more important . In the future , human resources will be a big problem for China if we do n't have an effective education system that produces enough talented people or allow good people to stand out . I want to do something about that and make a change . I wanted to be an artist when I was young . I wanted to be inspired by nature and I like colorful things . But it was only a dream . I still paint sometimes but not as often nowadays . I do n't think focusing on business is what I want to do forever . While it is the right timing for me to do this now , I do want to pick up my art in around 10 years , once the company is going strong and they do n't need me so much . I look forward to having more time to focus on my own life . If that happens , I want to travel and see different cities , meet new people , do things I enjoy , like painting , and perhaps learn a third language , such as French . Be brave : you need to be in order to face everything in front of you . If you do n't take a step out , you will never know the outcome . Failure is not an issue , we always can learn something from it so that we can do better next time . And be wise so that you can make the right choices . Also , sometimes you have to be careful of being too straightforward : you can easily hurt people without knowing it . That is a big challenge for me , in both my work environment and with my family . It is something I personally need to work on - I need to be take a softer approach and be more "" womanly "" . It 's quite tough as an only child as you have a lot of pressure from both inside and outside the family .",human
"fashion and sell at full prices , which is the key to a fashion company 's profitability and value . The old model for an apparel company was to design a collection , produce prototypes , send it to production and have it delivered to stores - with the whole process taking a year . When the product reached the store , the company might have missed the latest fashions of the season , but would still have to promote and sell its stock because the orders were already passed on to its suppliers . Zara reinvented the supply chain by first waiting to see the fashion shows of the high end fashion labels ( around six months ahead of a season ) in order to gain an idea what will be en vogue . After that it designs and produces garments in its headquarters in Spain and , within a few weeks , delivers the products to the stores . Zara owns its supply chain and all of its stores , whereby the stores report what is selling , so that Zara only produces what is in demand . Its designers are on the street or watching the Internet blogs to see the new fashions , so that the collection can evolve during the season . This fast model avoids making fashion mistakes and having to sell at a discount . All apparel manufacturers have had to learn from this model and try to adapt their supply chains accordingly . H & M , which designs in Sweden , but then outsources production to Asia in order to reduce costs , has had to evolve as well . Although in H & M 's focus is price rather than fashion , it decided to relocate some of its production closer to the market to be faster . For the jobs it continues to outsource to Asia , H & M imposes tighter deadlines to shorten the supply chain . Japanese retailer Uniqlo , purchased by Fast Retailing in 2005 , has an excellent inventory control system , and puts the right product at the right time in the right location . However , Uniqlo has a small number of designs that tend to be more simplistic and practical than those of Zara or H & M. It manufactures its clothing in Japan , but also outsources some work to China . While luxury goods companies have been successful selling their products around the world , fashion companies have also become global . H & M , established in Sweden , was first successful in Northern Europe , but has since successfully expanded into Southern Europe , China and the USA . Global growth opportunities allow it to add 10 percent more stores per annum . Zara was originally successful in Southern Europe and Latin America , but later expanded into Asia , some emerging markets , and has now entered the USA . It also opens 8 percent - 10 percent more stores per annum . Inditex has grown into the world 's largest apparel company , with more than 20 billion euro in sales and a market capitalization of 90 billion euro . While successful models have emerged , the history of fashion is marked by failures too . One of the most common pitfalls is to become overexposed . In the 1990s , Abercrombie & Fitch became the top brand for teenagers . Stores with loud music , the smell of cologne , teens dancing on the floor , and a popular logo led to worldwide success . But when the logo became overexposed , it lost its teen appeal and customers moved away . The company has now been struggling to revive the brand for the past five years . The jury is out for US fashion designer Michael Kors . After being one of the fastest-growing brands in recent years , the wave of popularity seems to be declining along with sales . Kors handbags were highly desired and the company went into aggressive store expansion to capitalize on its success . Kors went public in late 2011 at a share price of USD 24 . It peaked at close to USD 100 in the summer of 2014 . But unfortunately for the fashion designer , the apex was followed by an equally sharp drop after the brand grew too aggressively and suffered from overexposure . The company is now closing stores , de-emphasizing logo products , and focusing on the higher end to regain its aura . The success of a brand lies in its longevity and resilience . Hermes is a great example of a conservatively managed brand and why the company attracts one of the highest valuations in the luxury goods sector . The Birkin bag created in 1984 is still one of the most desired handbags , even by fashionistas . Burberry is a great example of a brand that was successfully rejuvenated . The check logo had become overexposed with the British football fans wearing Burberry products and cheap copies spreading everywhere . But with Christopher Bailey as a new designer since 2001 , the brand has been repositioned and successfully elevated to become a fashionable luxury brand . Higher-margin accessories , fragrances and babywear were added . The brand jumped from being worth 200 million British pounds in 1997 to 6 billion . But not every brand can stretch itself into new product categories . In conclusion , fashion companies can be worth investing in when they are riding a successful trend , or conservatively managed , or recovering from a setback .

"goes well beyond the scope of Escher 's letters . And even in the digicam era , there is probably nothing that can fully replace a face-to-face exchange of academic opinions . The digital edition of Alfred Escher 's letters represents a new milestone in historical research - in more ways than one . It sets a new benchmark for educational technology in this field . At the start of the project , the pioneering online editions of letters ( in particular those of the composer Carl Maria von Weber and the painter Vincent van Gogh ) were the key objective for the team headed by Professor Joseph Jung , Managing Director and Head of Research and Documentation at the Alfred Escher Foundation , together with project managers Daniel Hochstrasser and Bruno Fischer . But experts now consider that the team has been able to go well beyond this remit thanks to interdisciplinary cooperation ( which even included assistance from a theoretical physicist ) . This opinion was endorsed by the Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing in Cologne , which collaborated on this major project in an advisory capacity , when it chose "" State of The Art : The Digital Edition of the Letters of Alfred Escher "" as the title for the collection . "" The digital version includes the volumes that have already been printed ( and will incorporate those to be published in the future ) , as well as a varied range of additional content and functions . It represents the current state of the art in digital scholarly editing . Apart from the complete digitization of the material , this new version includes a number of noteworthy special features , such as multiple text reproduction ( both critical and diplomatic ) , the chronology , the register of people and places , the linkage of text and images , and the personalization options - to mention but a few . "" In other words , the digital edition leaves nothing to be desired , and it offers so much interesting and useful extra information that it is no easy matter for readers to focus on one original letter without becoming sidetracked among the vast amount of material provided . It goes without saying that the main focus of this edition is the person for whom it is named . But as well as yielding new knowledge about Alfred Escher and his extensive network , the project has also delivered a compact "" Who 's Who "" of Switzerland in Escher 's day , referred to as the "" Escher System . "" This new source has shed light on many areas of research relating to the 19th century , both as regards detailed questions and in terms of the broader context . The aspects covered include business , culture , mentality and society , Swiss foreign policy and - more generally - the history of the city and canton of Zurich , and indeed the history of Switzerland as a whole . There were appropriately enthusiastic comments from the guests invited to the vernissage , headed by the two patrons of the online edition : National Council President Hansjörg Walter and Walter B. Kielholz , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Swiss Re and Chairman of the Alfred Escher Foundation . The media also paid ample tribute to the achievements of Alfred Escher and the new possibilities opened up by the digital edition of his letters . Writing in the renowned German weekly "" Die Zeit "" , however , Daniele Muscionico took advantage of this timely opportunity to remind us once again of a "" female tragedy , "" namely the unhappy fate of Alfred Escher 's daughter Lydia . According to Joseph Jung 's biography of her , published in 2008 under the title "" Lydia Welti-Escher , "" it seems likely that she was merely preaching to the converted when she voiced her vehement opinions ; prosaic though the book 's title may be , it contains new facts about the notorious love-affair between Lydia Welti-Escher and the painter Karl Stauffer-Bern , finally demonstrating that Federal Councillor Welti really was involved in the scandal as well . And in his book "" Das imaginäre Museum "" ( "" The Imaginary Museum "" ) , published back in 1998 , Jung had already revealed the irresponsible use of funds by the government-administered Gottfried Keller Foundation , Lydia Escher 's brainchild . In his address at the vernissage , Jung described Alfred Escher as the "" Swiss citizen who has had the greatest impact on his country . "" The "" Basler Zeitung "" endorsed this view by equating Escher with his contemporary Jacob Burckhardt and concluding : "" Alfred Escher was a very great man . """,human
"mining sector , which makes up nearly 9 percent of national GDP , may have peaked this spring . Overall economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last quarter from a decade-long average rate of 3 percent , despite the fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates by two percentage points since 2011 to help spur growth . "" Australia has no room for complacency , "" Greg Evans , Chief Economist at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry told Credit Suisse . "" We 've seen the dividends from the mining boom , but in order to lock in those benefits , the rest of the economy needs to become more effective . "" The future may lie with companies like Canva , which has a casually hip open-plan office in Sydney 's fashionable Surry Hills neighborhood . On a recent visit to the Australian startup 's digs , 21-year-old Zach Kitschke demonstrated a promotional video of the company 's drop-and-drag design platform that allows non-designers to create blog layouts , small business websites , posters and other simple design projects . The voiceover artist in the slick video had an American accent - not an Australian one . Kitschke , Canva 's "" chief storyteller "" - Millennial generation nomenclature for marketing and public relations - explained that the choice was deliberate . "" We 're definitely approaching the business with a global focus , "" he said . In fact , Canva will launch simultaneously in Australia and the US in July , joining the ranks of a new breed of Australian startups that aim to be global businesses from day one . The buzz around Australia 's startups has been growing . An index created by Startup Genome - itself a startup - this year ranked Sydney and Melbourne 12th and 18th , respectively , among the world 's 20 best places for tech entrepreneurs , using measures such as total entrepreneurship activity , job creation and revenue growth . But one ingredient is in short supply : funding . Australian venture capital activity declined by 4 percent last fiscal year to 122 million Australian dollars , largely due to concerns about the global economy , according to a November report by the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association . But the number of Australian companies receiving venture investments rose by 9 percent to 83 . The organization noted that several established startups , such as BigCommerce , a Melbourne-based business that creates online stores for small and medium-sized businesses , have attracted large amounts of capital from established foreign venture capital firms . BigCommerce , which has processed nearly 1 billion Australian dollars in transactions , recently raised 20 million from General Catalyst Partners and Floodgate , two well-known American venture funds . And Atlassian , an enterprise software company with headquarters in Sydney , has become something of a local hero for raising a whopping 60 million-dollar Series A round in 2010 from Palo Alto-based Accel Partners . But a mismatch remains . Startup Genome ranked Sydney , Australia 's largest startup hub , fifth out of 20 cities for the level of tech startup activity , but 15th on access to venture capital . The report noted that funding comes disproportionately from friends , family , incubators and entrepreneurs themselves . Niki Scevak , co-founder of Blackbird Ventures , a Sydney venture capital fund , says entrepreneurs face serious difficulty when they try to raise a first significant funding round of between 1 million and 10 million Australian Dollars . "" There is a real gap in Series A funding , "" Scevak said . "" There 's a serious need for more VC firms to help these startups . "" Blackbird is aiming to fund five to 10 Australian tech companies each year but is only interested in those with global potential . Since February , Blackbird says it has seen 105 companies that fit the bill - including Canva , which the fund has invested in. "" It 's increasingly easy to sell these ideas around the world now , "" Scevak said . "" The very smartest of Australia 's young graduates are considering becoming entrepreneurs now instead of just doctors or lawyers . "" Canva co-founders Melanie Perkins , Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams , an ex-Google designer , are all under 30 . This is the second startup for Perkins and Obrecht , who in 2007 launched Fusion Books , an online publishing system for school yearbooks that currently has 10 percent of the Australian market and also operates in New Zealand and France . Earlier this year , Canva raised 3 million Australian dollars in seed funding from venture firms in New York and Silicon Valley , as well as angel investors that included Google Maps creator Lars Rasmussen . The company was recently invited to join Sir Richard Branson at a MaiTai Global event , a kite surfing camp for entrepreneurs and athletes founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai and professional kite surfer Susi Mai , on Necker Island , Branson 's private outpost in the British Virgin Islands . When charting its path to global business success , Canva has a role model in Genero.tv , a crowdsourced online video platform that allows filmmakers to create music videos or promotional films for artists and brands . Launched in Melbourne in 2009 , Genero.tv works with Sony , Warner Bros . and Universal Music Group , as well as brands such as Yoplait and MillerCoors . Genero.tv videos have been shown at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , the Cannes International Film Festival and the British Film Institute . "" We self-funded until January 2012 , and up until that point there were just two of us , "" said co-founder Mick Entwisle , who is still based in their Melbourne office , while partner Andrew Lane works in New York . While Entwistle said the company will always keep a Melbourne office , he says they had a global orientation out of the gate : "" From the beginning , we focused on key creative hubs ­ - London , New York and Los Angeles - and traveled a lot to get relationships on the music side , "" he explained . "" The Australian market was n't big enough . "" Entwisle said he found enough qualified developers in Australia for Genero.tv ' s needs , but tech industry players are nevertheless worried about the talent pipeline . Last month , Google Australia petitioned the government to mandate computer science classes from kindergarten until 10th grade , saying that only 2 percent of Australian graduates have advanced computer science skills . The country 's relative isolation could also be an obstacle . The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor found that Australia was below average in the proportion of early-stage entrepreneurs with an international orientation , with geographic distance being the most obvious reason . But that 's changing , and that 's very good news for a country that has relied on a turbocharged Chinese growth engine that appears destined for slower long-term growth . A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by Google Australia estimated that the tech sector could add 103 billion Australian dollars , or 4 percent of GDP , and 540,000 new jobs to the Australian economy by 2033 . Australia 's entrepreneurs surely are n't launching companies out of altruistic concern for their home economy 's need to diversify , but emerging Made-in-Oz tech startups are having that effect nonetheless .",human
"Bank of England is likely to loosen monetary policy again , through rate cuts and potentially a reactivation of asset purchases , after being on hold for almost four years . For the Eurozone , the referendum and slowdown in the UK mean higher downside risks for the economic outlook , but we still expect growth rates above 1 percent in both 2016 and 2017 . The European Central Bank is now more likely to extend its asset purchase program by at least six months in September , which may also require the adjustment of some important program parameters to gain the necessary flexibility . The next phase of political uncertainty may already be approaching , with the constitutional referendum due to be held in Italy in October . If the changes to the constitution are rejected - in which case Prime Minister Mario Renzi has said he would step down and call new elections - the euro and EU-skeptic "" Five Star "" movement is on track to become the largest party in parliament , as indicated by current polls . For the US Federal Reserve , the implication of weaker growth in Europe and further monetary policy easing is that it will likely have to remain in wait-and-see mode , even though downside risks to US growth and inflation seem significantly less pronounced than for the Eurozone ; the recent June payroll report has confirmed the robustness of the US economy . We have shifted the probable timing of the next rate hike to December 2016 , but acknowledge that substantial uncertainty remains around this new base case . Advanced economies once again face a potential economic shock and rising uncertainty , at a time when growth generally is still low . Global business activity , as measured by the Purchasing Managers ' Indices ( PMI ) , continued to expand only at subdued rates in June , even before the UK referendum decision . A significant setback in July cannot be excluded . We therefore expect the global economy to continue to grow sluggishly in the second half of 2016 , with risks tilted to the downside . This is particularly true for large economies such as China , where we expect a renewed slowdown after the recent rebound . A recurrent issue in an environment of subdued growth is the risk of an US recession - both whether it has already begun or what the probability of a recession is over the coming quarters . Recent US economic data shows a decline in industrial production that by historical comparison usually occurs during times of recession . However , manufacturing production has not yet shown a similar decline , and retail sales as well as employment continue to rise . This suggests that the US economy is , at least currently , still quite a way from recession . Regarding the likelihood of a recession over the coming quarters , Glenn D. Rudebusch ( 2016 ) from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has shown that there is little evidence for the often cited assertion that recoveries inevitably "" die of old age . "" With the current expansion that began in July 2009 being 85 months old , his model suggests that the probability of it ending in the next month is approximately 2.6 percent , which - when cumulated - gives a probability of just over 25 percent that the US economy may fall into recession over the next 12 months . A model developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that takes the yield curve as a recession indicator , currently indicates a risk of recession over the next 12 months of around 8 percent . This is significantly higher than the 2.2 percent indicated by the model just a year ago . However , 12 months ahead of the Great Recession that began in December 2007 , the model was already flagging a 20 percent probability of recession within the next year . As such , the risk of a recession has increased compared to a year ago , but still remains comparatively low . In this context , it is also important to keep in mind that low longer-term interest rates are a stimulus to the economy , thus providing the seeds for a continuation of the expansion . In addition , with energy prices apparently having stabilized , the largest negative impact emanating from the energy sector on US manufacturing activity may already have passed . Other components of domestic demand look relatively robust , especially private consumption and residential investment . We therefore continue to expect the US economy to grow by about 1.8 percent year-on-year in 2016 , and 2 percent year-on-year in 2017 .",human
"Accra , Istanbul and Indore . TransMilenio is a low-cost , high-impact system . The first phase ( 40 km ) was completed in just three years ( 1998 - 2000 ) . It captured international attention due to its high capacity - more than 40,000 passengers per hour , per direction - and an innovative public-private partnership model . The city builds the infrastructure , and local entrepreneurs ( currently seven groups with nearly 2,000 buses ) own and operate the fleet - profitably and without subsidies . Today the BRT is 106 km long and carries more than two million passengers a day . Its success helped mainstream the concept worldwide . Our database indicates that 150 cities have BRT and bus corridors ; 115 of these have been created since 2000 . Experience around the globe shows the great potential of BRT , but planning , financing and organizational difficulties should not be papered over . The important thing is not to rush into implementation until all the planning has been thought through . Also , every city is unique , so copy/ paste does n't work . Most of the obstacles are institutional rather than technical . Such projects are inherently complex as they involve aligning a baffling array of interests . Strong political leadership and well-crafted communications are essential . One of the big advantages of BRT systems is that they can frequently be realized within an elected leader 's term of office . Traditionally , urban transport planning has been all about moving cars , not necessarily people . As a result , most cities in the world have focused on expanding road networks . The result has been appalling . Clearly , creating more roads does not solve congestion ; it brings more cars to the streets . It 's like trying to fight obesity by expanding the size of our pants ! Several cities - Seoul , San Francisco , Toronto , Vancouver - have actually begun removing urban highways and replacing them with public-transport infrastructure . We urgently need to reallocate funding from urban parking and highways to sustainable transport . We support sustainable mobility and urban development initiatives in Mexico , Brazil , Peru , Turkey , India and China . We also work with researchers from Chile , USA , Portugal and Australia via the ALC-BRT Centre of Excellence and support 30 Latin American transit agencies in their quest for quality and integration . On-sit e meetings are particularly important when it comes to convincing decision makers . The construction of a 150 km BRT network in Rio de Janeiro in preparation for the FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics , and the expansion of Metrobús in Mexico City from 95 to 200 km are two notable examples . The introduction of BRT in Mumbai and Bangalore may be among the most challenging , and capacity enhancements in the saturated corridors of Bogotá and Istanbul will certainly be major undertakings . We expect around 30 cities to introduce BRT in the next five years , primarily in Asia - but also , in the near future , Africa . We have observed a cultural shift in Europe and , increasingly , the USA . People used to aspire to live in a house in the suburbs and commute . Today , more and more people want to live in the city itself - in denser , mixed-use areas . We do n't know how this trend will evolve in the developing world , but mass transit planning provides an excellent opportunity to influence the future shape of cities . Places such as Copenhagen , Curitiba and Singapore show how successful strategies that dovetail land use and transport planning can be . We must adapt these models to fit the needs of rapidly emerging economies . This needs to happen fast before car-centric urban sprawl takes root . Interestingly , the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Hangzhou have set up the two largest bike-sharing programs in the world ( 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles , respectively ) . Hangzhou plans to expand to 175,000 bikes by 2020 . It 's a revolution on two wheels ! China now also leads the world in metro systems , with Beijing and Shanghai already surpassing London as the longest networks . Transit ridership is growing rapidly in the USA . More people are choosing urban lifestyles . In the major urban centers a culture of membership rather than ownership is emerging thanks to social networks and car-sharing programs . In Latin America , on the other hand , we see the opposite trend : a growing middle class is now able to own more cars and motorcycles , and public transport usage is declining in most cities . The key in Latin America is to improve service and safety , which may require subsidies , and to introduce congestion charging and parking management schemes . Some of the key innovations are in vehicle technology . Trains are becoming lighter and more efficient ; buses are catching up with cleaner propulsion technologies such as natural gas and hybrid electric . The overarching goal must be to create multimodal , integrated public-transport networks with "" last mile "" connectivity to onward transit services as well as car and bike sharing . Mobile user interfaces , which are improving all the time as smartphone penetration rises , play an increasingly important role here . Smart ticketing systems , including electronic purses , are likewise becoming available on mobile devices . I see these technologies being further integrated and refined rather than some fame-changing innovation turning everything on its head . Crossing the Bosporus Strait and jumping on and off the fast and frequent Istanbul Metrobüs ; gliding through The Strip in Las Vegas on a shiny golden bus-cum-tram ; and rattling through hectic and historic Mexico City in a hybrid bus . My most surreal experience was sharing a train carriage with 700-plus people in Mumbai , which has the world 's highest throughput suburban rail system .",human
""" The credit line is the most appropriate instrument to provide to the country because ( Portugal ) has one foot in the market ( having already refinanced some bonds ) , and the goal with the credit line is to support a full return to the market , "" Credit Suisse analyst Axel Lang explained . "" It is an instrument that is less costly for the core countries to provide because it 's a precautionary credit line that may or may not be used by Portugal , "" said Lang , who said a final decision on the matter is not likely until after the German elections in September . Portugal is expected to face an estimated 12 billion euro ( about 15.8 billion US dollar ) funding gap in 2014 , when its 78 billion euro bailout ends and as it struggles to pull itself out of a brutal recession . The country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) contracted by 1.8 percent in the last quarter of 2012 , and Credit Suisse expects the economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2013 . Unemployment remained at 17.5 percent for the third straight month in March , according to Eurostat . "" Domestic demand is really under strong pressure , "" Lang said . "" At the moment , they rely on external trade , and the export sector is still pretty small for the size of the country … One of the problems is that its main trading partner is Spain , which is also not in great shape . "" European officials have already lowered Portugal 's deficit target for this year from 6 percent of GDP to 5.5 percent . The decision reflects a softening attitude toward deficits that favors a greater focus on implementing structural reforms , which Portugal has done fairly well , Lang said . The country introduced labor market reforms last year , for example , to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers . The burden of austerity is still a heavy one , however , and it could get worse . Portugal 's Constitutional Court recently rejected 1.3 billion euros in scheduled budget cuts for this year . While Lang believes the government will have a fairly easy time filling in the gaps this year , the following years may be more difficult . The government recently pledged cuts of 2.8 billion euros in 2014 , followed by 1.9 billion euros more over the following two years . "" This will have to be done in a context of weak economic background , continued rising unemployment , social discontent and ultimately , political risks , "" Lang wrote in his research note . Portugal 's finance minister has already acknowledged that spending will affect hospitals , schools and other areas . In response to the growing frustrations about belt-tightening , Portugal 's leaders have been trying harder to foster growth . Recently , officials announced broad measures to cut corporate taxes and provide incentives for foreign companies to set up shop in Portugal . "" They want to have a better environment for firms to operate in because it 's a very small economy , "" Lang said . "" They basically want to replicate the Irish model , "" in which a few large companies establishing themselves in Portugal could change the employment outlook and make the country seem like a viable place to do business . Ultimately , whether Portugal gets a credit line from Europe or not , reversing its status over the past decade as one of the slowest-growing Eurozone economies , is key to the country 's long-term success - and it will not happen overnight .",human
"because of massive foreign exchange purchases during the euro crisis . At nearly 525 billion francs ( as of the end of October 2014 ) , SNB 's balance sheet has now reached the level of 75 percent of gross domestic product . This is a record among OECD countries . Although the economic data points to deflationary rather than inflationary trends , this development is fueling concerns that the situation could lead to uncontrollable inflation . It is also feared that interventions in the financial markets and the influencing of interest rates and other financial market prices distort not only savings and investment decisions in the private sector , but also the distribution of income . How should these risks be dealt with ? It seems clear to us that the ( re)introduction of supposedly simple , mechanical rules for the behavior of central banks is not the answer . For example , the nostalgic sympathy for the gold standard as expressed in the rejected popular initiative "" Save Our Swiss Gold "" mistakenly considers that in times of crisis this limitation on the flexibility of central bank policy increases the instability of the economy rather than lessening it . The gold standard always had to be given up in times of crisis , and when it was temporarily reintroduced in the 1920s , it severely hampered the economic recovery . Central banks were equally ineffective in sticking to targets for quantities of money that were considered the recipe for success for several years after the inflationary period of the 1970s . Finally , the Taylor rule postulated in 1992 by the US economist John Taylor also failed . It required , for the achievement of a stable inflation target , a relatively mechanical lifting and lowering of the key interest rate , which was based on the rate of capacity utilization and the current rate of inflation . Although inflation in the phase prior to the crisis was stable and at a low level and there were only minor setbacks in the economy and financial markets , severe economic imbalances were nevertheless building up during this phase . Imbalances arose because financial institutions granted loans that no longer had any relation to the underlying capital or the growth potential of the economy . This resulted in leverage effects that led initially to a boom and then to a crash . In order to improve financial stability , the focus should therefore not be on the size of the balance sheets of central banks , but on the balance sheets of the entire financial system . The "" full money initiative "" offers a solution that we consider misguided . Signatures for this initiative are currently being collected in Switzerland . This initiative intends to prevent commercial banks from creating money ( liabilities side of the balance sheet ) by expanding their lending ( asset side ) , because under the initiative all assets would have to be financed by central bank money . As a result of the fact that under a full money system only the central bank could create money , the benefits of decentralized information and risk transformation systems , as brought about by competition between financial companies , would be nullified . It also seems naive to expect that this kind of limitation on banking activities would preclude future crises . The plan fails to recognize that "" shadow banks "" would fill the profitable gaps , perform lending and thereby create "" money . "" The appropriate response to the risk associated with lending and money creation by the banks is not an artificial narrowing of business opportunities for banks or other financial institutions , but primarily the route that has been taken - that of strengthening their capital base and therefore their responsibility for themselves . As shown in the report published at the end of 2014 by the Federal Council 's group of experts on the further development of financial market strategy , Switzerland has come a long way towards strengthening its financial stability . Such an approach is more useful than running the significant risk of full money reform with a very uncertain outcome . From a regulatory standpoint too , the full money initiative is problematic . It is obvious that the SNB would be more subject to political pressure to adjust money creation to suit every economic mood or situation than if the stability of the marketdriven banking system were strengthened . Such strengthening could also help to clarify the boundaries between the monetary authority 's and the financial regulator 's areas of responsibility , which have become increasingly blurred since the crisis ( keyword : macro-prudential measures ) . The concurrent blurring of boundaries between monetary and financial policy also increases the fear of inflation . If the central bank buys government bonds , it is de facto financing government deficits , while at the same time the depressed interest rates make it easier to refinance debt . And because , in addition to bond prices , the value of other assets is also rising , this policy could lead to the misallocation of capital ( keyword : speculative bubbles ) ; an additional effect that is exacerbating the debate . In our opinion , the correct response by regulatory policy to this mixing is based on two pillars : firstly , the strengthening of the independence of the central bank from politics , and secondly , the obligation of fiscal policy to maintain long-term fiscal stability . A good approach is the debt ceiling built into the Swiss Constitution , which should be extended to other areas such as financing of social welfare . As well as strengthening financial stability , this would noticeably reduce the pressure on monetary policy to solve every problem that comes along . A realistic view of debt dynamics in many industrialized countries , however , leads us to fear that this pressure might increase even more over the next few years .",human
"Facebook and Twitter . With that they can get a couple of seconds advantage over their competitors in divining the emotional moodswings that occasionally affect the market . There are numerous examples of social media being used in the industry and the possibilities are endless . Banks in sectors other than retail banking may utilize social media to build brand awareness and differentiate themselves from the competition . Alternative developments include the recent burgeoning concepts of crowdfunding and social lending . These ongoing developments necessitate the formulation of specific social media strategies that cater to banks in various sectors - there is no one size fits all approach . The focus should be on marketing or building a reliable brand-name that consumers can learn to trust and associate as a hallmark of quality . Yuan Jun Lim : Engaged customers will probably derive a greater sense of satisfaction from the services provided by the financial firms . However , the ability of social media to "" boost a company 's bottom line "" is a contentious issue which I believe is one of the existing bugbears crippling the adoption of social media in the industry . Notwithstanding headaches-inducing regulatory constraints , there is no direct , viable method to accurately or conclusively measure the ROI that an investment in social media can or will bring . It is thus a challenge to formulate a set of metrics that can accurately quantify the ' value ' of social media .

Maggie O'Toole : With traditional media , you may reach your prospects , but you reach everyone else , too - and you pay for that . If you 're selling high-end financial services , your target market may only be 3 percent of the population , but you ca n't put up a billboard that will be seen by only that 3 percent . Social media allows you to target your communications . Even better , it allows your prospective customers to self-identify by opting in to your communications . You know they 're interested because , by clicking "" Like "" or "" Follow , "" they 've as good as told you that they are . Maggie O'Toole : It 's true ; firms do face regulations that may hamper their social media marketing efforts . But those challenges may be more self-imposed than legal . We 're still in the Wild West days of social media and traditionally conservative financial firms are n't comfortable with that . They want rules and content review processes . What they need to realize is this : digital media actually makes meeting some regulatory requirements easier . For example , all digital communications are automatically recorded , meaning that there 's no trouble complying with requirements to keep records of all communications . Hugh Jorgensen : The industrialized world has conveniently trained consumers into always wanting higher quality service at a faster and cheaper rate - preferably in a way that involves dragging their fingers around the screen of a handheld object . I suppose this means that people literally want to feel that they can control the world around them through their fingers - of course , if I had any idea how to monetize this emotion as a financial service then I would n't likely give it away for free . Hugh Jorgensen : For the overwhelming majority of people , the only connection between financial services and social media is likely to be in the way of more targeted advertising . We are unlikely to see the average punter updating their Facebook or Twitter statuses anytime soon with the size of their savings accounts , investment portfolios or about an attractive variable interest rate option they just heard about . And if they do , I will probably block them . What is more likely is the growth of services like Twitter as highly self-tailored information devices , in the sense that if I 'm investing in corn futures , I have an incentive to follow commodity experts and corn farmers .",human
"result , it is no longer necessary to handle the goods themselves . This saves time and money , which , in addition to other developments such as abolishing customs and excise , has driven global trade and the global division of labor since the 1960s . According to estimates , the introduction of the box alone increased the volume of trade in the northern hemisphere nearly nine-fold in 20 years . The productivity of port workers rose sharply because it was no longer necessary to handle pieces individually . For example , British ports could now handle 30 metric tons of goods per hour - over 15 times more than before . Thanks to direct loading from road and rail to ship , one of the bottlenecks that accounted for nearly half of transport costs as late as 1960 was eliminated . While today the introduction of containers may appear logical - even obvious - at the time they seemed anything but practical , as a number of expensive adjustments were necessary . The price for standard usage and complete utilization of the advantages was extremely high . Container ships cost nearly four times as much per cubic foot of cargo space compared to traditional shipping . A container crane cost 1.75 million US dollars , and the container itself was 3,500 US dollars . In the first decade following their introduction , Australia was the only country to use containers besides the US , also initially for domestic transportation only . The first international usage occurred in 1966 with the transportation of boxes between the eastern coast of the US and Europe . Following the standardization of the container size at 2.6 meters high , 2.4 meters wide , and 6.1 meters long the next year , the simple transfer of goods between different modes of transport became a reality . By the mid-1970s , more than 40 countries had built port infrastructure for containers , including the Netherlands and the UK in 1966 , followed by Switzerland , France , Germany , Italy and Japan two years later . Yet there was still very little freight actually being transported in containers . Broad usage was bolstered initially by the US military , which by the end of the 1960s often shipped cargo for the Vietnam War and the Cold War in containers . This removed one obstacle to their wider use , as providers of partial containers emerged . Smaller companies could now use the box as well , even if they did not want to ship an entire container . Between 1984 and 2008 just under two-thirds of all goods that could be transported in containers were actually transported in this manner . Although today just under 15 percent of the total volume of maritime trade is shipped in containers , this represents more than half of such trade in terms of value , as electronic devices transported in boxes , for example , are more valuable than , say , wheat , oil and other commodities , which are not transported in containers . By the beginning of the new millennium the center of container trade had shifted to Asia . With just under 22 million standard containers transported ( 2012 ) , the connection between Asia and North America is the most important trading route in the world , followed by the route between Asia and northern Europe , with just over 13 million containers . Nine of the ten largest ports are in Asia , with seven in China alone . However , Europe is still home to the three largest shipping companies in the world : French company CMA CGM , the Mediterranean Shipping Company ( MSC ) , based in Geneva , and Danish company Maersk Line . Global container handling grew by an average of 10 percent per year between 1990 and 2008 , but the sector was not spared by the financial and economic crisis of 2008 . In 2009 , container trade fell for the first time in history , declining by 9 percent . Since then , the sector has struggled with overcapacity and falling prices . While the transportation of a standard container from southern China to northern Europe in May 2008 cost 4,000 US dollars , it cost less than half of that by the end of 2008 . Since then , prices have fluctuated sharply and even dropped to 400 US dollars in mid-2013 - about one-third of the price needed to cover costs . Cargo specialists continue to expect greater capacity than growth in demand in the near future . While many container ships were ordered before the crisis , long production times meant that they were not launched until 2008 . Paradoxically , despite the overcapacity , the largest ships ever built are currently being launched , with space for more than 18,000 standard containers . This can be explained by greater cost efficiency , represented by the three E 's : economies of scale , energy efficiency and environment . Providers can transport a box on a ship with space for 10,000 standard containers for half the cost of transporting on a ship with capacity for 2,500 units . Competition is thus intensifying , particularly on the main routes . The three dominant European providers plan to join forces in an alliance to divide up shipping . However , regulators have yet to give their approval . Smaller competitors are likewise in negotiations concerning an alliance . As a result , the range of routes and services offered to customers could increase . Because the consolidated volumes would be higher , some connections and offers would be profitable . This , in turn , could further bolster trade integration . The impact on prices is clear . First , the partners would be able to offer lower rates as a result of efficiency improvements , with the additional goal of squeezing out smaller competitors . In addition , they would also be better able to tailor their coordinated offering to demand on the respective routes . This could halt the price decline caused by overcapacity . Whether these changes will result in the same success as the introduction of containers , however , remains to be seen . The next major change may be imminent , but its outcome is highly uncertain . The success of the introduction of standard containers itself was not inevitable , of course . And yet the steel box has revolutionized global trade .

"tournaments . Some have even won championships at a professional level : Xherdan Shaqiri , Granit Xhaka , Yann Sommer , Fabian Frei and Valentin Stocker with FC Basel , Philippe Koch , Admir Mehmedi , Oliver Buff and Ricardo Rodríguez with FC Zurich . This generation is extremely hungry for success . And not daunted by the prospect of a major challenge . I would n't put it that way . Basically , a player "" discovers "" and "" makes "" himself . The coach supervises him on that path . People like me also are on hand to help them if problems arise . Pace and the necessary technical skill set , and then personality - I ask myself if I can imagine this player among those preparing for a professional match . It has nothing to do with physical aspects . It 's attitude . Players should possess the total conviction - I would even go as far as to say arrogance - that they can mix it with the very best . A player also needs the support of a stable family . Without a positive personal environment , their talent can just go to waste . Of course not . Anyone claiming otherwise is talking nonsense . There 's always a degree of uncertainty as to whether a player has it in him . And a number of players have surprised me on the positive side , for example , Gökhan Inler . He has developed superbly , but when he was 17 , I would not have backed him without reservations . Wasted is perhaps overstating things . But if there 's one footballer in particular who springs to mind , it would be Jonas Elmer of FC Sion . Where would he be today if he had been allowed to continue playing as a striker , just as he did as a C-Junior with FC Stäfa ? He possessed exceptional finishing qualities , but for no obvious reason was "" re-tooled "" as a defender . With experience , you can reach conclusions a bit more quickly . But in general , you need a huge amount of information before you can ascertain whether someone has what it takes . The famous "" wow "" effect Yann Sommer produced is something that I have seen only rarely . I came across him during my first few days as head of Basel 's youth section . When I attended training of the U16s and was looking to make myself useful , the coach asked me to give the goalkeeper some practice . You can generally expect a 15-year-old to wait quietly for instructions from the new boss . But not Yann . He told me precisely what he wanted me to do : the exact number of crosses , how many high shots , how many hard flat shots . Sommer had an astonishingly precise idea of what he needed to become successful later in his career . Well … Shaqiri was 13 at the time , and displayed some very interesting qualities . As did Xhaka , by the way . What was striking about the pair was that they remained injury-free , despite the great intensity of their games , and that they both exuded leadership qualities on the field . Xhaka had another talent off the field though : As the squad treasurer , he never had any problems collecting contributions from his fellow players . Even so , with all that , both players still needed to develop some skills . I suppose it is the day when I see that a junior is finding it too easy , even when he is moved up to the next age level . With Xhaka and Shaqiri , it was when they were 16 . They joined the U18s to play a top-league team - and then simply toyed with their adult opponents . He has exceptional variety as a player , can play on both sides of the pitch , then moves beautifully between the two sidelines , which gives him the opportunity to exploit gaps in opponents ' zonal play . Due to his technique , he 's rarely under pressure . He receives the ball perfectly , which gives him more time for the next pass . In addition , it was evident at an early stage that he would bring a wonderful marketing edge : His dynamic style brings spectators to their feet . Back in his Winterthur days , everyone knew Admir was good . But when he played at D-Junior level he had to battle weight problems , which is something that Murat Yakin also had to contend with many years ago , by the way . But today he has a very impressive physique . At the U21 European Championship , not only was he one of the best players , he was also one of the fittest . And I recall on one occasion when he was n't used , he put in a special practice after the game . It 's vital that we produce the footballers the market wants . Just to give an example , to combat the acute shortage of strikers we have recruited a number of attacking coaches in the last few years , and have made special efforts to develop offensive movement skills . But now it appears we lack central defenders . What the market wants are big , strong aggressive players weighing 85 kilograms or more . For us , success is when the players make the leap from youth ranks to the senior national side . Two players per year is a bare minimum . Five would be outstanding . But anything in between should be considered good to very good . Commitment Unlike the European or World Championships , professional clubs are not obliged to release their players for the Olympic Games . So in this sense you are approaching clubs as a petitioner - you have to demonstrate an understanding for the clubs ' interests , which at the same time are themselves contesting important games . However , one can stress the importance of the Olympic Games for the players ' careers , and for the Swiss Football Association , particularly as we did n't qualify for this year 's European Championship at the senior level . I had the impression that the clubs appreciated our personal approach . I 'm optimistic . We are taking a strong squad to London . That 's a serious misconception . I 'm expecting the Olympics to be very evenly matched . And the many unknown teams , the "" exotics , "" make things more difficult , as it 's hard to know what to expect . We approach the Olympics like we do the European Championships . The first objective is to get through the group stage . With Mexico , South Korea and Gabon in our group , that 's hardly a slam dunk . Then we 'll see . The key thing is that everyone identifies with the team on an emotional level . Everyone must realize that this opportunity will never come around again . It 's now or never . Peter Knäbel ( 45 ) is Technical Director of the Swiss Football Association since 2009 . He is responsible for the five units of grassroots football , top-level football , trainer development , women 's football , and representative teams . He won a U16 European championship with Germany and played in the Bundesliga for Bochum , St. Pauli , 1860 Munich and Nuremberg . Following that , the native of Westphalia , Germany , first transferred to FC St.Gallen with his wife , who is Swiss , then to FC Winterthur . After his playing career ended , he became head of the youth training program at FC Winterthur , before going on to achieve success in the same position at FC Basel . He has two children and lives in Riehen .",human
". In other words , they ca n't think properly . With too little sleep , people start driving the waking day with stimulants like caffeine . As a result of that , when they try to sleep at the end of the day , they often ca n't . At that point , they may take alcohol or sleeping tablets to induce sedation , which does n't allow the most important biological process of sleep to take place . Just because you are n't conscious does n't mean you 're getting all the benefits of real sleep . Interpersonal skills also fall apart with too little sleep . Tired , sleepy people tend not to be empathetic . With sustained sleep deprivation , too , people can get depressed . After all , how does your body override the urge to sleep ? It activates the stress axis . Sustained stress also suppresses the immune system , leaving you more susceptible to infection , Type-2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease and even cancer ­ - a finding for which there is good evidence in studies of nurses who work the night shift . A lack of sleep also increases your risk of weight gain and obesity . Sleepy people have more ghrelin , the so-called "" hunger hormone "" , so they 're more likely to eat carbs - particularly sugars . And it only gets worse : the older you get , the more vulnerable you are to the health impacts of sleep deprivation . There is a lot of individual variation in how much sleep people need . But sometimes , people who claim they do n't need much sleep are simply too tired to discern that they 're sleepy ! This has been shown in nighttime taxi drivers , who claim not to be tired when they 're actually suffering the effects of massive sleep loss . It 's a critical issue - night-shift workers are often impaired without knowing it . People 's individual sleep cycles vary . If I were trying to figure out someone 's individual body clock timing , I would ask : "" What happens on your free days ? What time do you get up without an alarm clock ? Does your sleep pattern change markedly when you 're on vacation ? "" Many people change their sleep habits on holiday , and the schedule they follow at those times is a better reflection of their true individual sleep-wake cycle . Sleep patterns also change as we age . Once we get past the age of 10 , we tend to go to bed later and later . We start becoming night owls in the teen years , though the average female will never stay up as late as the average male . Then there 's a slow reversal , so that by the time you reach 55 , you are back to the wake-and-sleep times that you experienced just before puberty - around age 12 . Some of these changes seem to be driven by sex hormones , which rise and fall over time . But in general , younger people are late night types , and older people are morning types . The human body clock works on a cycle of about 24.5 hours , so we need to align the internal clock to the external world by about half an hour each day . Light is critical to that process . If a person went into a cave that had constant darkness and temperature , he or she would still fall into a regular rhythm of sleeping and waking , but would get up and go to bed slightly later each day because of that extra half-hour in the internal cycle . The classic mismatch between our internal clock and external time is called jet lag . We eventually get over jet lag as the light in a new time zone re-sets our internal clocks . But the reason we feel so awful in the meantime is that during the adjustment , all the different clocks in the body - the ones in the brain , liver and stomach , for example - are slightly out of sync . They all realign eventually , but it takes about a day for every time zone you cross . If you 're traveling west , it 's easier : You can adapt faster to an expanding day . Trying to adapt to a contracting day when you go east is more difficult . So here 's my simple advice : Seek out morning light whenever you can when you 're traveling west . But if you 're traveling more than six or seven time zones east , you need to avoid morning light at your destination for three days and seek out afternoon light instead . Lots of people take melatonin , but its actual impact on our biology is poorly understood . Melatonin is a biological marker of nighttime , meaning it is produced when it 's dark . So , it could be that sending your body this "" dark signal "" in pill form augments the light signal detected by the eyes and speeds up the resetting effects light has on your body clocks . But we have n't shown that definitively yet . One thing we do know is that about 70 percent of people will fall asleep more quickly if they take 3 milligrams of melatonin , which makes it easier to sleep in a new time zone . Of course , one should always talk to a doctor before doing that . We published some of our recent findings in the journal "" Cell "" a month ago . We were trying to figure out why it takes so long to adjust to a new light-dark cycle . Why , for example , does it take an extra day to recover for each time zone crossed - why does n't your body make a more immediate adjustment ? In the paper , we described a new pathway that limits the effects of light on the molecular clock . When we greatly reduced the amount of a key protein in that pathway in a group of mice and shifted the light cycle they were exposed to by six hours , their internal clocks adapted after a day , rather than six days . Since the human clock is very similar to the mouse clock , this pathway could be used to develop pharmacological agents that speed up the resetting process . We 're already working on drugs that can shift the internal clock in humans - and not just for jetlag . Drugs like these have the potential to help people with poorly adjusted inner clocks , a phenomenon we find in many conditions , including mental illnesses such as schizophrenia . As a society , we 're not going to put the 24/7 genie back in the lamp and start living without electric lights . But people should know that sleeping less makes them more susceptible to health problems . For example , our ability to process food , particularly glucose and fats , is not as effective at night . So , we know that people who work night shift are susceptible to obesity , and that tendency is made worse by the type of food that 's usually available during those shifts . You ca n't do much about your work schedule , but night-shift workers could adjust their eating habits by sticking to small , easy-to-digest portions of foods with relatively high protein , low carbs and low fat . Something calming and easy for the system to process . Most of all , I want people to think about sleep more seriously . We spend around 36 percent of our lives asleep . It 's our single most important behavior , and a lot of really important stuff is going on in the brain while we sleep . If you make getting enough sleep a priority , you 'll perform better at work and in your relationships , and you will be less likely to get sick . Exactly . The idea that sleep is a waste of time is relatively recent . If you look at the early scientific literature - even into the 19th century - people embraced sleep . The turning point came with the invention of the electric light bulb . Thomas Edison said sleep was a criminal waste of time and a throwback to our cave days , and that attitude persists today . As a species , we are incredibly arrogant , but we ca n't abandon our embedded biology . Margaret Thatcher famously said sleep is for wimps . She was wrong .",human
"took place : Following the Indian Wells tournament , the two Swiss jointly led the annual ranking ( "" Race to London "" ) , in which all players start from scratch at the beginning of the season , directly followed by Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic . The similarities , however , do not stop there . Side by side , "" Fedrinka , "" as the duo is occasionally known , beat Serbia and then Kazakhstan in the Davis Cup , leading Switzerland to its first semifinal since 2003 . This gives them the opportunity , between September 12 and 14 in Geneva 's Palexpo , to lead their country to this competition 's final for the second time - the first being in 1992 , when Jakob Hlasek and Marc Rosset narrowly lost against the US in Fort Worth , Texas . The prospect of the semifinal , which will take place in front of 18,400 spectators and was quickly sold out , further strengthens the bond between the two teammates and 2008 Olympic doubles winners . In the recently concluded clay season , the form curves were also similar , albeit similarly disappointing . Following the brilliant start in Monte Carlo , where they even dueled in the final and Wawrinka won his second-most important title , the next weeks did not go according to plan for the two world conquerors , at least from an athletic perspective . Federer missed Madrid due to the birth of his twin sons Leo and Lenny , immediately failed in Rome against the Frenchman Jérémy Chardy , and suffered an unexpected defeat in the last sixteen in Paris against the Latvian Ernests Gulbis , missing a smash that would have brought him a 2 : 0-set-lead . Wawrinka fared even worse , losing the opening matches in Madrid and Paris to outsiders Thiem and Garcia-Lopez , and winning only one match in Rome in between . Therefore , both Swiss players were not just overtaken in the "" Race to London , ' ' they were left fairly far behind . The good thing about it : Ahead of Wimbledon , they are still the first behind Nadal ( 6,465 points ) and Djokovic ( 5,250 ) and well on track to once again jointly reach the season finale in November in London . Wawrinka ( 3,735 ) is still ahead of Federer ( 3,360 ) , even though the latter won his seventh title , and second of this season , on grass at Halle on June 15 . Another similarity : Wawrinka 's first grass tournament also went well , with a semifinal on the same day at London 's Queen 's Club . The two countrymen are therefore in similar starting positions prior to the traditional highlight of the tennis year , the Wimbledon Championships ( June 23 to July 6 ) . This is despite the fact that Federer is considered the ultimate grass king , a surface that favors talent , improvisation , and offensive play , while Wawrinka is a comparatively inexperienced grass player . The statistical comparison , at least , is crushing for the player from French-speaking Switzerland : While Federer with 14 grass titles , seven each in Wimbledon and Halle , and a match record of 125 victories and 18 defeats is the most successful professional grass player of the age , Wawrinka has a clearly negative record with 15 victories and 19 defeats . In 2003 , Federer started on a series of 10 tournament victories and 65 match victories on grass , which was only ended at dusk in the 2008 Wimbledon final by Rafael Nadal . Over the past 11 years , he has won 109 of his 116 matches on this surface and is therefore as dominant as Nadal is on clay . However , Wawrinka should not be underestimated in Wimbledon . "" I have never been able to prepare for grass as much as I have this year , and I feel good , "" he said shortly before the tournament . "" If I start well , I can achieve a lot . "" Swiss tennis expert Heinz Günthardt even believes him capable of scoring another great coup : "" If he survives the first week , there is no reason why he should n't win the tournament , "" he said following the French Open . However , Federer is considered much stronger and received a shot of self-confidence with his victory at the Gerry Weber Open . "" Every tournament victory is special and I am overjoyed that I have won here again , "" he said following the 7:6 , 7:6 final against the Columbian Alejandro Falla , his 79th tournament victory . After Nadal lost his first game in the same tournament to outsider Dustin Brown and with Djokovic starting Wimbledon without a preparation tournament , another set goes to the Swiss at the start of the grass season . In addition , neither has a lot of pressure starting Wimbledon ; after all , 2013 marked Federer 's earliest failure in the All England Club in 11 years , as he lost in the second round to the Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky , while Wawrinka had to leave after the opening match against the indestructible Australian Lleyton Hewitt . The 29-year old Lausanne native has only won one match in the last four Wimbledon tournaments , but was nonetheless in the last sixteen in 2008 and 2009 . The special thing about the Swiss success story is that the man from Basel and the man from Vaud do not see each other as rivals , but acknowledge each other 's successes and even use them as building blocks for themselves . Federer never misses an opportunity to declare himself Wawrinka 's biggest fan , while the latter is remarkably persistent in stating that , whatever he himself may win , Federer remains the greatest player that tennis has ever seen .

"forecasts from the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) and the major economic research institutes remain negative for the current year and assume only marginal rises in inflation over the coming two years . If they turn out to be correct , Switzerland would be one of the few countries in the world that continue to offer positive net yields . Since August 23 , 2011 , investors have been accepting negative yields - most recently -0.79 percent - at the weekly auctions of Swiss government money market claims . This of course begs the question of why investors would be prepared to accept negative yields not just on the money market but also for longer terms . The answer is not simple . On one hand , the renewed rise in risk aversion in view of the debt problems in Greece and Spain has triggered a flight to secure investments . On the other hand , from the perspective of non-Swiss investors , an investment in Swiss francs represents a diversification element in their portfolios . In addition , passively managed assets tend to reinforce the phenomenon of negative yields because they remain wedded to their positions , regardless of price . Another factor is the flow of funds into indexed products , which is being met with a relatively illiquid market . This forces investors of passively managed portfolios into investments at a yield level that is unsustainable in our view . In recent years , the Swiss Federal Finance Administration has been a net repayer of debt , which has led to a shortfall in the supply of government bonds . In this context , active portfolio management offers the great advantage of flexibility . In other words , in extreme situations , an active investor or asset manager could employ judicious structuring and more flexible allocation in terms of duration and credit spreads to move farther away from their benchmark than would be permitted for a passive portfolio . This would improve the chances of generating a higher return than the passively managed investment model . Will Swiss franc interest rates continue to fall ? We are convinced that the SNB is able and willing to maintain the minimum CHF / EUR exchange rate of 1.2 that was set in September 2011 . In fact , the SNB reaffirmed this commitment following its most recent assessment of monetary policy . In any case , a look at the Euroswiss futures market confirms that the SNB 's monetary policy clearly has credibility because it implies negative money market interest rates for at least another two years . However , given the ongoing tensions on the markets , the SNB is likely to have to make a major effort . Since mid-May the sight deposits of banks with the SNB have risen by approx. CHF 37 billion . This could be an indication of the level of funds that will have to be deployed to defend the minimum CHF / EUR exchange rate of 1.20 . We believe that the prospect of a further drop in interest rates has now receded and that the risk of rising interest rates has increased .",human

"of deciding who was in the line-up , I obviously made sure the team would fit well together . That is an essential for being able to perform well . And then , of course , I stick to my leadership principles : for example , teach respect , which is very important . Credibility , solidarity toward one another - that 's what every single player needs to put into action , and what I demand as the team 's role model . This is to ensure we can then concentrate on what matters , on our sporting objectives , including qualifying for the Round of 16 . Michael Strobaek : That 's right . For us , the game starts all over again every day . But we also need to have a strategy , otherwise we 'll very quickly lose our game . For me and for us , it 's also true that the stronger the team you 've got , the greater the likelihood you have of winning . But in our case the fact is that your opponent does n't always behave in a rational manner - things can change . We always need to try and keep a level head , maintain a certain discipline and a systematic approach ; if we think our opponent is seeing things in slightly the wrong way , however , we respond accordingly . Because when we 're winning someone else is actually losing . And that always means keeping your eye on the ball , not the man , and understanding that sustainability and discipline are an important factor for lasting success in our game . Ottmar Hitzfeld : I 've always had the same management philosophy as coach . I started out 30 years ago with Sportclub Zug , in the Swiss second league . I actually managed my team in the same way that I currently manage the Swiss national side and used to manage Bayern Munich , where the focus is on respect . Management of my team - and leadership skills - was always enormously important to me . Because I 've got to be recognized as the leader , I have to be honest and I have to be consistent . I 've got to be credible , I 've also got to be loyal during times of crisis , not just look for scapegoats , and always stand behind my team . Solidarity is also important to me , as is integrity . Integrity obviously means leading by example , in all situations . I think that 's very important when you 're the leader of a team . With respect to the football itself , the technical expertise : I think it goes without saying that this is something everyone who 's involved in football must be able to deal with - as is the psychological ability . It 's not just about having your own team but about having an opponent , too . We need to think about what our opponent has in store , what strategy they 've got , adjust to their strengths and weaknesses , and then act accordingly . Michael Strobaek : Unlike football and a football team , I 'm a player-coach because I also have to be out on the pitch every day . Together with the team , I 've often got to decide - sometimes quickly , sometimes not so quickly - about the direction we want to go in and where we see the opportunities . The fact is that the business we manage frequently forces us to look at things from the opposite perspective . For example , that means you 've actually got to exploit crises - not run away from them , but actually use them as a buying opportunity . Alternatively , it means you need to exit a market just as everyone else is moving in. That 's what 's special about the business world : what goes up must one day come back down . Getting that right is ultimately one of the real successes you can have as a chief investment officer . The second key to success , as I mentioned earlier , is the discipline to approach things in a way where you 're led not by your emotions but by rational thought and decision-making processes . Ottmar Hitzfeld : I think the coach can still have a major influence , including through substitutes . The coach can make tactical adjustments , he can ratchet up the pressure , he can play more of a counter-attacking game where the team stands back . I can still influence that from the bench . I 've got influence during the half-time break , I can speak to my team again , I can motivate my team again , I can give them another confidence boost . People often say the coach has given the team a dressing-down at half-time , that he 's given them verbal abuse and criticized them - the opposite of what I do , really . My view is that when you 're dealing with people you need to support them , to help them - even when things are going badly . That 's when the coach is needed . And I can play with one striker , with two or three strikers . In other words , I still have tactical options . That 's why I can still have an influence during the game . Michael Strobaek : I always try to involve the team in decisions and ask everyone what they really think . Sometimes people within a team do n't agree and it takes an umpire to say we need to do A or B. Ultimately I 'm the one who does that . Because at the end of the day - just like Mr. Hitzfeld - I 'm the one who 's responsible for a good or a bad result . Ottmar Hitzfeld : Our objective as the Swiss national team is completely clear : it 's to survive the group stages and get through to the last 16 . We do n't have easy opponents in the shape of Ecuador , Honduras and France , but it 's do-able . And if we get through to the second round , we may well surprise . After that , who knows - the sky 's the limit . Ottmar Hitzfeld : For me , the big favorite is Brazil . They 've got a fantastic team and an experienced , outstanding coach ; they also have some obvious advantages given the climate in Brazil , which can also impact on the team 's performance . Michael Strobaek : I hope and believe Switzerland will get through to the final 16 . It would be a great result for this country . Unfortunately , I 've got to say there 's a consensus between Mr. Hitzfeld and I , because I too think Brazil will win - they will be very hard to beat . Ottmar Hitzfeld : I think the last time Spain were at the very top of their game was in Euro 2012 . What 's more , the team has aged slightly and Spain in particular play a complex game .

"number of fashionistas , shopping is actually a leisure pursuit to which the weekend is dedicated . The idea of going "" gòuwù "" - shopping - alone is alien to the Chinese . Material fortune is something to be shared with relatives and friends . Although China has a per capita income of only around 6,600 US dollars a year , even those on only a modest income will not hesitate to splash out on high-end products . Indulging in luxury is something that is found across all strata of urban society . It is not uncommon for a taxi driver who gets by on fairly limited earnings of 4,000 yuan ( around 700 dollars ) a month to nonetheless possess the very latest Nokia mobile phone in the upper price segment . Consumption is done differently here , as is thrift - which might manifest itself in day-to-day haggling with vegetable traders , for example . Shopping is writ large in Shanghai like in no other Chinese city . Here the country is already experiencing what will probably become reality all over the country in 10 years ' time : a consumer boom . While Beijing has a reputation for rather conservative political lobbying and Guangzhou has turned itself into the leading center of industrial production , Shanghai has used the Chinese economic miracle to establish itself at the forefront of consumerism . It is from Shanghai that almost all the retail industry 's global players have driven forward their Chinese expansion strategies . And nor do they look out of place - every imaginable international brand looks like it belongs in this metropolis on the Huangpu River , a city that is also home to the tallest buildings in China , the Chinese stock exchange , the world 's second-largest port , two airports , a Formula One race circuit and Expo 2010 . For the rich to flaunt their wealth is not vulgar but chic in China . This is readily confirmed by Jim Siano , CEO Asia Pacific of the luxury brand Montblanc : "" Our clients are often entrepreneurs or company executives who are typically better educated than most of their fellow countrymen . But Chinese consumers generally have come a long way . "" While high prices may conflict with China 's reputation as a country producing cheap goods , they certainly do n't act as a bar to the Chinese consumer . Quite the opposite : "" In the last 20 years , Chinese consumers have spent a significant proportion of their monthly income on luxury products . High-quality luxury goods are truly prized in China , "" observes Siano , a New Yorker by birth who has been scrutinizing the Chinese consumer intensively for the last two decades . Siano is impressed by the level of detail that the Chinese consumer will go to before purchasing a brand product : "" For the Chinese , the origin of a product is very important , as is the brand and its history . They 'll do lots of research in order to learn more about the background - what a name stands for , where the strengths of a product lie - and only then will they make their buying decision . "" An increasing number of Chinese can easily afford luxury articles like the watches , pens and leather goods that are sold by Montblanc in its 95 Chinese stores . The richest 10 percent of households in this country have experienced a quantum leap in wealth over the last few years . On average they currently earn 255 percent more than they did in 2005 , and now account for more than 35 percent of the total income of all Chinese households , although it is also true that almost all Chinese are better off than they were a few years ago . For the world 's luxury brands , the affluent Chinese represent a target group that is now increasingly exercising a decisive influence on the global market for high-end consumer goods . Jim Siano reaffirms the point : "" Our store in Shanghai 's CITIC Square has been the largest of any of our stores in the world since it was opened in 2008 . However , we are now planning to increase the size of this outlet threefold . "" An important factor for brand consumers is also the choice of location : "" The Chinese luxury goods market is seeing a major drive toward much larger stores at leading retail locations . I 'm expecting much more competition in the retail industry , and between operators of shopping malls as well as between brands . "" Even the financial situation of Chinese in the lower income brackets is undergoing "" moderate growth . "" The poorest 20 percent now earn more than half as much again as they did in 2005 . Those in the middle income brackets have seen their earnings rise by 98 percent over the same period , i.e. virtually doubling . This trend is likely to continue , as the savings rate in China is falling rapidly . Whereas consumers were still saving 26 percent of their income back in 2004 , the proportion of income set aside had declined to just 12 percent in 2009 , as established by the Consumer Survey of Credit Suisse . Consumption has a major future in China : As a result of the birth control policy introduced in 1980 , the vast majority of Chinese under the age of 30 are single children . The Chinese born in the 1980s and 1990s grew up as the focal point of attention for their family , and are now accordingly being targeted by brand producers as high-spending consumers with serious purchasing power . This generation of "" Little Emperors "" - as they are termed in Chinese - has enjoyed the strongest growth in income over the last three years , a position they will maintain over the next three years too . China 's real estate market is currently one of the world 's "" hottest , "" particularly in high-earning cities such as Shanghai and Beijing . One of the major drivers of the Chinese economic boom is the procurement and fitting-out of residential property . Urbanization is proceeding at breakneck speed in Zhongguo , or the "" Middle Kingdom , "" as the Chinese frequently term their own country : Credit Suisse is anticipating an annual growth rate in urbanization of 0.8 percent . This means that the 46 percent of Chinese who lived in urban areas in 2009 will rise to 60 percent by 2030 . Dramatic growth is expected in the medium-sized cities of central and western China in particular . In other words , some 190 million new Chinese urban residents will have to be provided for in terms of both infrastructure and residential space . Analysts at Credit Suisse are convinced that it is precisely these "" new urban dwellers "" who will drive the boom in consumption . This also goes hand in hand with the Chinese government 's goal of increasing domestic demand so as to reduce the country 's dependency on exports . The result ? Another massive surge in Chinese consumption . Dong Tao , an economist at Credit Suisse , expects this to undergo a quantum leap from 1.7 trillion dollars this year to 15.9 trillion dollars by 2020 . This would see China increase its proportion of global consumption from 5.2 percent in 2009 to 23.1 percent in 2020 , thereby leapfrogging the US to become the world 's largest consumer market . In a number of areas , the future is already very much in evidence . For example , China 's automotive market is already the world 's largest in terms of numbers of units . Since 2004 , the proportion of households owning a car has risen from 12 to 28 percent , i.e. more than doubling . But this proportion is set to rise further . In the Credit Suisse Consumer Survey 2009 , around 35 percent of households responded that they were either "" definitely "" or "" probably "" going to buy a new car within the next three years . For foreign automotive manufacturers , China is now the ultimate growth market , something that applies to German car brands above all . In the first five months of this year , Volkswagen Group China sold some 778,000 vehicles , a 48 percent rise on the record year of 2009 . Plans for the construction of the tenth Volkswagen factory in the Middle Kingdom - in the city of Foshan in the Pearl River Delta - are already at an advanced stage . In the first half of 2010 , Audi sold around 109,800 cars in China , 2,000 more than in its domestic market . BMW has enjoyed sales growth of some 100 percent in the first six months of this year . German manufacturers will gladly meet special requests of their Chinese customers , for example their preference for a significantly elongated wheelbase . Upmarket brands such as Porsche are likewise increasingly focusing on their Chinese customer base : In 2009 , the company chose to unveil its Panamera model at Auto China in Shanghai . Similar trends are also apparent in the markets for flat-screen televisions and notebook PCs . Consumer interest in both products has risen continuously over the last few years . Where the former is concerned , Chinese consumers are latching on to the high-end segment with screens of between 37 and 45 inches , with a strong trend toward higher specification evident here too . Although many Chinese brands have become increasingly accepted and their market share has risen , particularly in the last two years , international brands remain exceptionally popular : In particular , the great advantage held by foreign brands has been maintained in the area of technologically sophisticated products and luxury goods . Where fast-moving consumer goods such as food , drink and cosmetic products are concerned , foreign and domestic manufacturers appear to be running neck and neck . However , Chinese companies have a much stronger position in sectors such as the Internet and travel , a situation partly explained by the market barriers faced by new entrants . The boom also has its negative aspects . Today 's Chinese consumers show much less interest in issues such as sustainability and social responsibility than their Western counterparts . When it comes to energy efficiency in manufacturing , China still lags far behind international standards . Water and air pollution levels are often considerable . The rural population as well as the western , northeastern and central provinces of the country are participating in this growth to only a limited degree . Within the developing regions , too , the gulf between rich and poor can often be immense . Nor is the rest of the world immune to the negative aspects of the Chinese consumer boom . China 's hunger for raw materials is already resulting in a number of market distortions . The export of valuable ground resources - such as "" rare earths , "" for example , which are particularly important in high-technology industries - has recently been restricted . This is having a dislocating impact on entire industry sectors . China also now occupies a leading position as an emitter of greenhouse gases . Last but not least , China continues to be reproached for a currency manipulation policy that critics claim gives the country an unfair competitive advantage . These problems notwithstanding , most Western manufacturers , investors and employers are hoping that the surge in Chinese consumption will maintain its strong momentum , and that the escalators of consumer temples such as the Super Brand Mall in Shanghai will remain packed with shopaholics . And not just on Sunday afternoons .",human
"spending is difficult to quantify exactly . But if one assumes that the US consumption-to-GDP ratio reverts back to its long-term average of 66 % from its 2006 peak of 76 % , the reduction in spending is likely to amount to around USD 1.4 trillion per year , based on 2008 US GDP of USD 14 trillion . This cutback in US consumer spending represents over 7 % of US annual GDP and 1.6 % of annual global GDP , and is one that will likely need to be compensated for if global growth is able to return to its trend level of 3.5-4 % . The void left by the US consumer will be difficult to replace . Nonetheless , many observers hope that a drop in spending by the US consumer will at least be partly offset by increased consumption-led growth in emerging markets . The arguments in favor of emerging market growth story are clear : For the first time since the industrial age , the 5.4 bn people living in emerging economies today account for more than half of global GDP , on a purchasing power parity ( PPP ) basis . And this share of the global economy is set only to grow in the future . In fact , the IMF expects emerging markets to grow by an average annual rate of 5.3 % through 2014 , which dwarfs the 1.3 % growth rate the Fund expects advanced economies to grow at over the same time period . Also , unlike many advanced economies , emerging economies today often have lower debt levels , higher foreign exchange reserves , and they make up over 82 % of the world 's population - representing around 5.4 bn potential consumers with an estimated combined purchasing power of over USD 18 trillion . And while the emerging market growth story is certainly no novel concept , most corporate strategies have focused almost exclusively on a relatively small fraction of emerging market consumers - the emerging middle class , or those 1.4 bn people in emerging markets already earning between USD 3,000 and USD 20,000 per year . This emerging market segment is largely urban , already well-served and highly competitive . At the same time , this wealthier segment makes up only one quarter of the entire emerging market population ( Figure 1 ) , leaving the remaining majority of 4 bn people largely neglected by corporate strategists . This large group of emerging market citizens constitutes the base of the world 's economic pyramid ( BoP ) . And at 4 bn people , it is the world 's largest untapped consumer market . Looking forward to the world post the crisis , the BoP proposition is likely to become increasingly difficult for companies to ignore . The main reason for this is its size . Its 4 bn people make up over 60 % of the world 's population . This size effect is especially relevant when one considers the combined purchasing power of BoP citizens : Although the segment represents 4 bn people still living in relative poverty - earning less than USD 3,000 per year - their combined purchasing power amounts to no less than USD 5 trillion , according to the World Resources Institute . And if one notices that this figure of USD 5 trillion in purchasing power is at least comparable to the USD 12.5 trillion estimated for the wealthier emerging market segment ( incomes between USD 3,000 and USD 20,000 ) , it also seems probable that the BoP segment is likely to increasingly pop up on corporate radar screens as companies expand their quest for growth in the post-crisis world . But for all of its merits , investors should note that the BoP market segment does not come without its own unique challenges . For instance , the relative poverty of BoP citizens means that they spend over 80 % of their income on food , clothing , and fuel , leaving little to no income for other discretionary spending . Also , the BoP segment is still largely rurally located , with most people not yet having access to reliable credit facilities , telecommunication services , and some not even having access to electricity or clean water . These challenging conditions make gaining access to BoP consumers very challenging . The resulting isolation of BoP consumers has in turn imposed an even heavier cost on them - the so-called "" poverty penalty . "" This concept refers to the phenomenon that poor people living in regions isolated from the mainstream economic markets tend to pay a premium on everything from rice to credit - often 25 times that which the rich pay for the same services . This occurs mostly because the lack of market competition for goods and services in BoP regions allows marginal retailers to extract premium profits from low-income consumers who have fewer options and less-sophisticated consumer habits . A similar phenomenon can be traced back to the US as well as to Europe in the 1950s , when rural consumers paid a significant premium to urban consumers for basic goods - due mainly to their relative isolation from the mainstream , competitive economy existing in larger urban markets . So while multinationals could certainly offer their services to mitigate the poverty penalty , the overbearing risks and challenges inherent in BoP markets have meant that Western corporate entry has been more of an exception than a rule . But a few private companies have indeed successfully engaged the BoP markets . These companies typically adapt their strategies to allow them to offer BoP consumers products and services uniquely customized to their needs . Perhaps the most prominent example of a strategy uniquely fitted to the BoP context is the single-use packaging concept . According to this idea , companies develop small , single-use packages of products such as detergent , shampoo , and cooking oil that enable poor customers to buy a product that they otherwise may not have been able to afford . This strategy has already proved successful in many developing countries . In India , for example , Proctor & Gamble , Hindustan Lever , and other competitors already make single-serve versions of their products to the extent that this format already makes up 60 % of the Indian shampoo market and 95 % of all shampoo units sold in India . But single-use strategies are not the only creative approaches companies use to enter BoP markets . Other innovative strategies include the issuance of low-denomination telephone cards , shared-usage models for telephones , cars or other household items , and the extension of microcredits to people who would otherwise not qualify for access to financial and credit facilities . Through such strategies , companies are coming up with innovative ways of making products available to BoP consumers at affordable prices . Not only do these strategies unlock the BoP purchasing power , but they also expand local markets , reduce average product prices , and generally improve the standards of living in the local communities - setting in motion a virtuous cycle of grassroots human economic development . In the final analysis , and in the context of the global economy beginning to recover from what has been the worst recession in 70 years , we believe that any sustainable global recovery is likely to require a healthy and balanced growth in private demand from emerging market consumers . And as the balance of economic growth shifts from developed to emerging market consumers , multinational companies are likely to become increasingly aware of the potential and the promise at the base of the world 's economic pyramid .",human
"The Forum 's aim is to show that Switzerland 's future as a business location , a place for thinking and working is dependant on a powerful financial center . I was approached by highly committed individuals . They were obviously looking for someone who was n't a parliamentarian ( any more ) ! - It was n't long before the elections , and I had decided not to run for office again . Personally , I strongly believe in the qualities and the importance of the Swiss financial center . The decision was thus easy for me as a politically-minded citizen . It 's no coincidence . We first tried to build a "" communication platform "" with members of parliament and financial center specialists . There 's no reason why businesspeople and employees ca n't join the Forum . However , the number of members has to be limited , as we want the Forum to stay manageable . We 're very satisfied with what has been achieved to date . The public is very interested in the topics we cover . Our impact is continually improving and expanding . After all , the Forum was founded less than three years ago . I think so . Businesspeople are now aware that the banks ca n't replace equity capital that is lacking . In individual cases , it obviously hurts to be turned down when circumstances are difficult . That 's natural . But the banks have had to learn the hard way when it comes to loans . Those financial institutions that successfully carve out a place in the market will survive . The big banks can push home the advantage of their size , while the small ones will be better off as niche players . However , the term "" critical mass "" is n't an absolute concept , as it has to be considered in relation to what a company is offering . We actually take a stance on the issues that concern us , irrespective of the matters being voted on . However , also expressing our opinion on issues concerning the financial center - whether directly or indirectly - that are the subject of voting campaigns cannot fail to strengthen our profile . I do n't see any risk of jeopardizing our fundamental commitment , as we weigh matters up very carefully before making our statements . A "" No "" vote would jeopardize the agreements in the "" Bilateral I "" dossier , which are crucial for the Swiss economy . The Swiss financial center would also suffer the consequences directly . Therefore , in line with those in economic circles , we are in favor of the extension of the free movement of persons with the EU . Banking secrecy is an important factor for the success of the Swiss financial center . It 's not the only one , but it 's definitely a major one , together with political stability , moderate taxes and significant expertise in asset management . It 's not an unfair competitive advantage in my view . The state 's protection of its citizens ' privacy is part of our liberal view of a nation . This is something we can be proud of . Swiss banking secrecy offers criminals no protection . Switzerland has been playing a leading role in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism for many years now . Banking secrecy is a cornerstone of the success of the Swiss financial center . We should do what we can to ensure its survival .",human
"in certain key positions , and there could be a change of emphasis . One important signal is the nomination of Alexander Konovalov as minister of justice , succeeding Vladimir Ustinov . Soaring commodity prices and the rise of emerging markets like India and China are indisputably the main growth drivers . Russia 's growth rate has the potential to remain strong if the necessary structural reforms , such as modernizing the country 's judiciary and bureaucracy , are carried out . To tackle the widespread corruption is also essential . But the country can theoretically continue to grow even without these structural reforms , albeit at a slower pace , thanks to its vast reserves of natural resources such as oil and gas . Undoubtedly yes . It 's unequivocal that the broad population has benefited from the past decade 's economic growth . It can however be argued that the depth and breadth of the wealth distribution has not been as fair as it could have been . It will depend on the development of commodity prices . These have declined in relative value over the past 100 years , but rapidly risen over the past seven years with energy prices being a major lever . Russia 's energy supply is an important asset , though a diversification of its economy would be good to sustain a broader growth base . It 's developing quite strongly . We see this in terms of the prices paid for banks being acquired . The sums paid for financial institutions are way above the levels paid for similar institutions just two or three years ago . There is a strong inflow of assets into the sector . Clients from the middle class have quickly become more sophisticated , not so different from their European or American counterparts . They tend to invest in their home country and put their reserves abroad , mainly in Europe or Switzerland . When it comes to Russian high-net-worth individuals , they tend to be closer to their businesses than in the West . They are often both the owners and the managers of their business empires . He seems aware of the structural reforms Russia urgently needs . The question is what his political focus will be . Russia cannot really be compared to the three other BRIC economies . It is so different , with its higher per capita income , smaller population and Northern mentality . My experience as banker has taught me that while investors talk a lot about business opportunities in India and China , they actually make the highest return on investment in Russia . Yes . Medvedev is the Russian president and can decide which ministers he wants to work with . In theory , he has considerable authority . It remains to be seen how much he can actually do in the short and medium term . It 's a tough issue to resolve , as billions of dollars have been flowing into the Russian economy driven by soaring oil and gas prices . Structural reform , encouraging investments , would help absorb more money in a non-inflationary way .",human
"give a project order to a small group of architects . In view of the fact that the historically valuable CS head office is a listed building , along with other buildings on Paradeplatz , the owners were very much aware of their cultural responsibility . The future Paradeplatz would have to fulfill the following requirements : "" Visitors should not only have seen the building from the outside , but should also have experienced it on the inside . The space 's design should be stimulating and communicative , generous and open , "" according to the assessment report . In mid-1997 , the Executive Board gave the green light for a fundamental renovation . The project order was finally granted to the architect 's office , Atelier 5 , which developed a plan corresponding to the bank 's wishes of creating welcoming place for the public . These architects excelled in achieving a subtle interaction with the pre-existing structure and found the perfect equilibrium between preservation and renovation . At the same time , they placed the return to the building 's original state before their own desire to create something new . Denis Roy , the architect responsible for the project , comments : "" The planning was influenced more by the building itself and its history than by us architects . "" Today , visitors no longer enter the Credit Suisse banking hall when they step inside the building , instead they find themselves still in a public area - in an arcade which leads through to Lichthof . Denis Roy comments : "" When Adolf Brunner built the Lichthof in 1876 there was also a passage here . This was closed during the major renovation in 1900 and it was converted into a banking hall . Now - 100 years later - we have reopened this arcade . This is probably the most distinguishing characteristic of the entire project . "" This monumental edifice was also opened up towards Bahnhofstrasse . The connecting arcade , which is concealed along the front of the façade by a portico , was once the main hall of the post office . This approach also leads to the heart of the building : "" The passage from Bahnhofstrasse to Lichthof is the most significant architectural intervention in our project , "" says Denis Roy . The visitor passes underneath several archways before arriving in the Lichthof , which is flooded with light from the skylights overhead . The entrances from the three thoroughfares - Paradeplatz , Bahnhofstrasse and Bärengasse - all lead to a central point . The contrast between noisy Paradeplatz and the temple-like Lichthof is noticeable . This central space is an oasis of peacefulness . The actual entrance to the Credit Suisse bank branch is in the hall where the securities counter once was . "" The hall , which is a listed structure , is in the form of a nonagon and was an extension of the banking hall at the turn of the century . We have envisaged the old securities counter as the entrance to Credit Suisse . This new entrance is in exactly the same spot as it was when the architects , the Pfister brothers , constructed the building in 1876 on the corner of Talackerstrasse and Paradeplatz , "" says Denis Roy . Ten shops and a gourmet restaurant have opened their doors in the high-class Credit Suisse shopping arcade . In here a myriad of shops find themselves side by side ? Fabric Frontline , the silk emporium ; Christophe Graber , the avant-garde goldsmith ; Swiss Air Lines ; Strozzi , the delicatessen temple ; and La Serlas Zurich , the specialist in exclusive and unique jewelry and antiques . The host of international names are no less impressive . Interest peaks when one sees the Italian fashion titans , Giorgio Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna , and not to mention the optician 's Cartier / Nicole Diem , leather goods from Bottega Veneta , jewelry from Bulgari and the first flagship store from Montblanc .",human
"new process for all of us . And mistakes were obviously made . Thanks to brilliant people , however , we 've achieved some amazing successes in recent years in particular , "" Simeon Sakskoburggotski - Bulgaria 's king from 1943 to 1946 , and prime minister from 2001 to 2005 - recently told a group of investors led by Credit Suisse . After getting off to a bumpy start , the reforms of the last five years have indeed led to a relatively stable economic climate . Real gross domestic product , for instance , has advanced more than 5 percent every year since 2001 ( in 2005 and 2006 , it even hit 6.2 and 6.1 percent respectively ) . The inflation rate - having reached a record 2,000 percent at the start of 1997 - is now about 4 percent , while the rate of joblessness has fallen from just shy of 20 percent in 2000 to today 's sub-10-percent level . In a meeting with participants on the Interactive Field Trip , finance minister Plamen Oresharski spoke of his real optimism : "" From an economic standpoint , our reforms have been a great success . But I think the fact that the reforms are recognized across all parties is just as important . So it does n't matter who 's in charge next - the reforms will be maintained . "" But despite Bulgaria 's economic achievements , it would be a mistake to compare its current position to the likes of Poland , Estonia , or the Czech Republic . The country continues to battle against an inadequate judicial system and an often cumbersome administration . Added to that , corruption scandals continue to make the headlines . Perhaps corruption - and the seemingly never-ending war against it - should also be seen in a sociopolitical context : The fact is , Bulgaria 's gross domestic product in 2005 was only 3,480 U.S. dollars per capita - almost 6,000 dollars less than the average annual income of the countries included in the latest accession round . All the same , finance minister Oresharski does not shy away from identifying the problems : "" It 's true that not everything is rosy . In Sofia , we have taxi drivers who used to be nuclear physicists - but they earn more money driving around in a cab . At the same time , a lack of highly qualified labor threatens to impede our economic progress . And even though we 've made major strides in the fight against corruption and in bringing in administrative reforms , we 've still got further to go . "" Like many emerging economies , Bulgaria is a land of contrasts - or perhaps more accurately a land of many shades of gray . Investors such as André Felder from Switzerland , who runs a bicycle factory here with an annual output of 300,000 units , has some tales to tell : From deceitful business partners to institutionally driven quasi-bankruptcies . On the other hand , Felder thinks the position has actually improved considerably in recent years and that he is on safe territory today with his investments in the real estate sector . This change for the better is also fueling speculative activity among potential investors . They are drawn by an increasingly solid currency , falling interest rates , a relatively stable political situation , and above all rising stock prices . Assuming all goes well , membership of the European Union will continue to spur things on . In Bulgaria , they 're hoping for growing interest on the part of foreign investors , a flourishing of domestic industry due to the outsourcing of labor-intensive manufacturing processes and , last but not least , improvements to the often moribund infrastructure thanks to EU structural and cohesion funds . The jubilation expressed by the country 's people on New Year 's Eve is perhaps turning out to be justified - if a little premature . As Plamen Oresharski says : "" The population may be slightly overoptimistic when assessing the benefits of joining the EU . But at the end of the day we are a pragmatic people , and we do n't expect miracles . While we are doing all in our power to move forward , we should n't forget that our development must be on a sustainable footing . But the groundwork has been laid - and the omens are good .

"n't do anything different . I try to put myself in the composer 's shoes , to interpret and communicate like a translator . Nowadays , everything we do is quick and often without thinking . You do something in a hurry and move on quickly to the next thing . That 's how we live today . The need for people to slow things down again and take a break has never been as great as it is today . We crave a slower pace of life . That is why , today , there are so many museums , days of remembrance , history books , and old music being played . Our view of memories , history , and classical music is rather archaic . As the counterpoint to our frantic world , we have created a world of nostalgia that we coddle too much . For example , Beethoven is not just some ghost from the past . He is part of our everyday lives . The songs of yesterday , today , and tomorrow always meet up with songs from hundreds of years ago . At the Festival , you can feel how these two worlds collide . The purpose is for the audience to ask : Was that music from the Middle Ages or today ? Was it by Mozart or Beethoven ? The program is meant to bewilder listeners in a positive way as well as motivate them to ponder and reflect on it . On the train from Landquart to Davos , there are six places where you can press the button to request a stop . I did that once , and I was the only person who got off . I found that sensational ! In every work , there is a pause , and that is precisely where the most spectacular things always happen . For that reason , the Festival offers concerts that allow people to come and go as they please . The international musicians and ensembles , be it the Chamber Choir , Davos School of Music , or the Swiss Army Band , provide additional "" stops . "" Requesting a stop means being willing to take a break and be surprised . The Swiss Army Band is playing with Finnish director Dalia Stasevska , cellist Nicolas Altstaedt and pianist Friedrich Gulda . We owe the opportunity to see the merging of these worlds to Ueli Maurer . Soldiers guard the WEF in Davos each year . I wrote a letter to the Minister of Defense and asked him to safeguard something that is seriously endangered : namely careful study and discernment through listening . The army needs to protect that , too . He wrote back and promised to send 120 soldiers in the form of musicians from the Swiss Army Band . Being young means being carefree , original , and fresh , but also unreflective . That 's why I want to combine young and old . The concerts are meant to be a unique experience for both the audience and the musicians . The festival is intended to provide a forum , inspiration , or simply an opportunity to escape for a little while . Besides , what does it even mean to "" be young ? "" The Armenian composer Tigran Mansurian , for example , conveys through his music more youth than virtually anyone else . Davos was merely the beginning . I was a student , and though I already had some talent , I was also a little out of my league at that Festival . I found myself confronted with musicians who were much better than I was . They were more insightful and asked questions I had never thought of . However , I got over it and came to realize that everything was part of a collective world . As artistic and creative director , I want to take that thought and carry it further , bringing together people with open minds and continuing the cycle . "" Living Room "" by American composer John Cage . That is the first piece that will be played at the Festival . Everything possible will happen in that "" living room . "" I see Davos as one big living room with its doors wide open . For the Festival , we are going to create a living room where people can meet and the "" Night Shifts "" ( Nach(t)schichten ) portion of the program will take place . Most things always happen before and after a concert , when people discuss and reflect . I want the listeners to get incredibly bored . For most people , "" boredom "" has a negative connotation . When people are bored , time passes slowly , and that is the most amazing thing that can happen to them .",human
", engineer and inventor Vouillamoz would n't let go of the idea until he came up with a possible solution years later : Two flexible reservoirs , one at each end of a circular , enclosed tube , were to be filled with different-colored liquids that do not mix . When one reservoir is compressed , its fluid flows into the tube to indicate the time ; meanwhile , the other fluid is forced back into its reservoir . Positive and negative polarity ensures separation of the two liquids . Like magnets , they repel each other at the point where they meet . With the help of Patrick Berdoz , a longstanding friend and experienced entrepreneur from the medical technology field , Vouillamoz embarked on an adventure . Berdoz recognized the idea 's potential , and recruited additional engineers from his network . Together they drew up the first technical specifications . Emmanuel Savioz , another experienced start-up entrepreneur , soon joined the team and the HYT company was set up . After a year 's intensive research and development work , an initial prototype was produced . However , some important steps first had to be taken on the road to creating a luxury watch : Although Vouillamoz , Berdoz , and Savioz now had the fundamental technology to produce a water wristwatch , they had no experience of the watch industry . In 2010 , they finally succeeded in hiring CEO Vincent Perriard , a passionate watchmaker who had spent many years working at renowned firms such as Audemars Piguet , Concord , and Technomarine . "" It 's always been a dream of mine to work with water and mechanics , because they 're two diametrically opposed worlds , "" says Perriard . "" The biggest challenges lay in finding an interface between the mechanical movement in the watch mechanism and the fluid system , housing the two systems in a confined space , and ensuring they interact perfectly , "" recalls Berdoz . The liquids also had to be developed in accordance with watchmaking industry requirements . They need to be able to resist vibration , knocks , and temperature fluctuations , as well as be stable over a long period . Calculation of the exact volume of fluid in the two reservoirs was also critical : "" The total volume in the closed loop must be accurate down to the microliter , "" says Berdoz . In addition , HYT developed a special system for adjusting the time of the watch . This prevents the liquids from flowing too quickly and getting mixed together . The watch mechanism also had to be developed from scratch , because the reservoirs containing the liquids took up a considerable portion of the available space . That task was entrusted to Manufaktur Chronode in Le Locle . Neuchâtel firm Etude de Style was responsible for designing the watch . The concept was presented to various watch dealers and distributors from summer 2011 onward . By the time of the watch and jewelry fair Baselworld 2012 , HYT 's watchmakers were in a position to present the world 's first mechanical-fluidic hybrid watch - the H1 - to an enthusiastic audience . It costs between 43,000 and 65,000 Swiss francs , depending on the model . "" Although we 've not yet been able to ship the watch , many dealers and collectors paid upfront for their watch on the spot . That 's not normal in the watch industry , "" Berdoz explains . The creators are already busy working on successor models , the H2 , H3 , and H4 . The target audience consists mainly of collectors and watch aficionados from all around the world . The new concept and attractive shareholder base also proved persuasive for SVC Ltd . for Risk Capital for SMEs . From a very early stage , it provided HYT with seed funding - partly on account of the many advance orders . This was later followed by growth financing , to ensure the company can fully exploit the potential of its innovation . "" SVC 's involvement is also important to us , in that such a renowned investor opened the door to other financiers , "" notes Berdoz . "" With fluid mechanics , we have given the world of watchmaking a new means of expression , "" he continues . But the passionate entrepreneur and his team have a lot of other cards up their sleeves : In the course of developing and designing the H1 , the engineers also acquired unique expertise in the field of microfluidics - the behavior of fluids in tiny spaces . Various related patents have been registered . "" Our technology could be used for accurate injections in the medical sector , or the diffusion of fragrances , for example , "" says Berdoz , with an eye to the future .",human
". However , just 7 percent of voters expect their personal well-being to decline , and two-thirds of respondents believe that their situation will remain unchanged . Overall , these moderately optimistic , yet also somewhat pessimistic survey results are in keeping with economic indicators in the early fall of 2014 . The Purchasing Managers Index ( PMI ) , compiled by Credit Suisse in cooperation with procure.ch , continues to point to an expansion in Switzerland 's industrial sector , but expectations for economic growth have clearly declined since the spring . Switzerland 's labor market , which is still quite robust overall , is also showing signs of weakening . Another economic downturn in the euro zone is the primary reason for declining growth in the industrial sector . After a period of recovery in 2013 , Italy and France once again slid back into recession , which has in turn affected the economy in Germany , our most important trading partner . The conflict in Ukraine and the resulting drop in German exports to Russia and Eastern Europe , along with the persistent economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets , have caused problems for Germany - which , in turn , has affected Switzerland 's export industry . The US economic engine does not appear to be strong enough to offset these negative effects . With the exception of the recession in 2009 , which in spite of the global financial crisis turned out to be relatively mild , the Swiss economy has been remarkably successful at weathering turbulence in Europe . The reason is what we refer to as the "" super cycle "" in Switzerland 's domestic economy : Extremely low interest rates - a result of the monetary policy put in place by the Swiss National Bank in response to upward pressure on the Swiss franc and the risk of deflation - stimulated demand for credit-financed residential property and durable goods.Relatively unrestrained financial policies in the cantons and communities , as well as steadily rising subsidies in the healthcare system , have led to greater overall economic demand.The agreement with the EU on the free movement of persons , as well as an increase in the labor supply as a result of the euro crisis , have made it easy to meet the demand for workers.Immigration and higher employment have also stimulated the real estate market . This "" super cycle "" seems to have protected the Swiss economy against external economic upheaval . Whether one should be optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects for Switzerland 's economy in the coming year depends on the answers to these two questions : Will the world economy , and particularly the European Monetary Union , return to a path of robust growth in the near future ? Second , will the "" super cycle "" in Switzerland 's domestic economy continue , perhaps at a slower rate , or is it possible that it will come to an abrupt end ? We tend to be pessimistic about the first question , in particular . A number of fundamental considerations suggest that the global economy is likely to remain fragile and that we will not soon transition to broad-based , robust growth . First of all , private households still have a high level of debt in many of the more developed countries , and private debt has risen substantially in many emerging countries too , as in Brazil for example . As a result , there is pressure to save money , and consumers are likely to continue to be cautious . Second , the level of public debt is much higher in nearly every country than it was before the financial crisis . Here , too , it will be necessary to cut costs . Since a large share of tax revenues goes to transfer payments ( and it is politically very difficult to change that situation ) , it seems quite unlikely that a public policy of investment aimed at promoting growth will be adopted . Cautious consumers and financial uncertainty are hardly a recipe for a substantial increase in corporate investment . Companies , too , are likely to continue to be cautious . Furthermore , fiscal issues increase pressure on the central banks to pursue a very expansive policy . While this policy may reduce the risk of recession , the question is to what extent it leads to sustainable investment growth . Finally , the overall political situation offers little reason for hope that we are about to enter a new period of strong global growth . In today 's multipolar world , which seems to have taken the place of hegemonic dominance by the United States and the West , geopolitical tensions are unlikely to decline over the long term . This will inhibit rather than encourage investment activity . Particularly in periods of economic instability , moreover , there is a tendency toward increased protectionism . In general , it is proving difficult to achieve cooperative , efficient international solutions , for example to further stabilize the international financial system . This , too , makes it more difficult to return to higher growth . As a result , we are unable to make optimal use of continuing rapid technological progress . There is another structural problem as well : the progressive aging of the population , which limits growth . A certain degree of pessimism also seems warranted when it comes to the future of Switzerland 's "" super cycle . "" Persistently low interest rates and the real estate boom have encouraged a trend toward increasing household debt in Switzerland too . Understandably , concern over an excessively rapid increase in loans and areas of potential instability in the financial system have attracted the attention of regulators . Self-regulatory measures in the affected industries have finally begun to reduce the rate of growth in Iending and indebtedness . We can therefore hope that the credit and real estate cycle will come to a gradual end , although such a soft landing is by no means guaranteed . A decline in demand , triggered by other kinds of turmoil in Europe or worldwide , could have a serious effect on Switzerland 's labor market . In that case , the real estate boom might give way to a dramatic decline and a shortage of refinancing . Switzerland 's economic prospects will be affected not only by European and global growth , but also by the outcome of the pending negotiations with the European Union . Continuing uncertainty over the status of our bilateral agreements would certainly have a negative effect on investments in Switzerland by both domestic and foreign companies . Thus there is considerable uncertainty about the future of the Swiss economy - despite its strengths , which have been demonstrated over and over again .",human
"timepieces worn by 007 , yet is so revolutionary that it could find its way onto millions of wrists . Its manufacturer is Apple , and it is due to launch in autumn 2014 . The launch date has been suggested not just by speculation in blogs and the media , but also by some of the few facts known about the project . On July 22 of this year , the relevant authority in the USA granted Apple a patent for a "" wrist-worn electronic device . "" Drawings entitled "" iTime "" show a strap allowing an attachment to be clipped into it . While competing brands have already launched their own smartwatches , Apple is waiting patiently for now . However , the fact that the company has been headhunting for experts from Swiss watchmakers and managed to entice away the sales director of Tag Heuer indicates that its reticence was merely superficial . "" The word is that production has already started in Asia , "" comments Robert Weiss , owner of the consulting firm that bears his name in Männedorf , near Zurich . As a computer specialist and innovation consultant , Weiss has his finger on the pulse of the industry , and he is confident that Apple will score a big hit . He believes that the key to this success will be the products that the company already has on the market . "" The Apple watch will make sense only if it docks with the iPhone . The matter of compatibility with the devices that potential buyers already own is crucial , "" explains Weiss . Health will certainly be a key issue : "" The announcement of iOS 8 showed that Apple is placing a great deal of emphasis on health functions . "" Uwe Neumann , analyst and telecommunications expert at Credit Suisse , reports that discussions have already taken place between Apple and the United States Food and Drug Administration . "" The vision is that one day you will be able to buy the iWatch on prescription , because you can use it to measure your blood pressure , for example . "" Apple need not worry about the fact that Swatch has announced a fitness watch for 2015 , stresses Neumann . "" Apple 's watch is not a watch in the conventional sense , but rather an addition to the ecosystem built up around other devices ; a kind of communication center . Integration of the Siri voice-activated software , for example , would be very interesting . Swatch ca n't keep up with that . "" Given that fact , IT expert Robert Weiss is astonished that despite discussions with Apple , the Swatch Group wants nothing to do with any partnership . He believes that a shared path would have been positive for both companies . "" The Swatch Group would have been able to help Apple in matters of production technology . It has enormous expertise in this sector , such as in respect of water resistance and robustness of glass and housings . Apple naturally wanted to tap into that , but Swatch boss Nick Hayek graciously declined . "" For Hayek , the fitness Swatch is probably no less than a form of prestige project . It is intended to show that the Swatch Group remains innovative and is ready for a new gadget war , as Pierre-Yves Donzé , professor of economics at the University of Kyoto in Japan and originally from Neuchâtel , recently explained to the Berner Zeitung . Even luxury conglomerate LVMH ( Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton S.A. ) does not intend to ignore the new product entirely . "" With regard to the smartwatch issue , we must find our own suitable means of access , "" as Jean-Claude Biver , board chairman of watch brand Hublot , is quoted as saying . Credit Suisse analyst Neumann does not think that the Apple watch can or should stand alone . He believes that the company has both a technical and a financial interest in the interaction between its products already on the market , such as the iPad or iPhone , and the anticipated smartwatch . "" The watch is highly likely to offer an incentive to buy other Apple devices , and vice versa . Or , to put it another way , if you have only the iWatch , you wo n't get much satisfaction out of it . "" Robert Weiss agrees with him : "" Previous smartwatches have suffered from inadequate integration . If I do n't have any apps to go with it , the product will have a hard time . It needs to be integrated in the technical environment that encompasses the hardware , software , and services in equal measure . Apple already has a lot of content in the background that it will expand for the smartwatch / iPhone combination . "" In spite of everything , Credit Suisse analyst Neumann does not rule out the possibility that the iWatch will initially enter the market in the form of a slimmed-down and therefore cheaper version . "" I can imagine a product that 's not yet fully mature and that you can use only to do fairly simple things , such as receive emails from your linked iPhone . In terms of price , it would probably be somewhere between USD 150 and 200 . A truly mature product would eventually cost in the region of USD 350 . "" Based on Neumann 's cost estimate , we can infer that Apple 's plans will affect the watch sector in the low- and medium-price segments at most . "" There could be a certain amount of crowding-out in this sector . Manufacturers of fitness wearables , such as Polar , will likely be hit harder . However , we believe that a much larger new market can be created . It is a matter of winning over people who do n't currently wear a watch at all . That being the case , watchmakers do n't necessarily need to bundle up just yet . "" The luxury watch industry , which is so significant for Switzerland , sells a completely different type of product anyway . "" The appeal of watches of this nature lies in their durability and stable value , which an Apple product cannot offer due to its technical orientation . They also captivate people through their design . They are items of quality jewelry . By contrast , you cannot demand USD 10,000 for something that you have to replace every two years , as is the case with smartphones . "" However , Apple leads the electronics and technology market when it comes to design , and this is likely to be a crucial competitive advantage , according to IT expert Robert Weiss . "" For a long time , Apple has been making its products out of metal , whereas its competitor Samsung , for example , is still using plastic . "" And finally , Apple has a major trump card to play : "" Advertising will not be necessary for the iWatch . That much is evident from the fact that there is already so much talk about a product that is not even on the market yet . """,human
"launch pad for an amazing career such as that of cellist Sol Gabetta ; on the other hand , the event at the Lucerne Culture and Convention Center can brutally expose the limits of a young musician such as … well , no-one actually : Luckily , in the history of the prize , which was first launched in 2000 , there have not been any negative examples ; instead , there are just nuances between high and the very highest levels . So what does the very highest level mean for Vilde Frang ? Perfection ? We need to guard against false ideas of perfection , explained the violinist to journalist Urs Mattenberger from "" Più "" magazine . After all , perfection would signify an easing of tension , she says . "" But after every concert I want to do better . So I prefer to take risks when I 'm playing , and to accept a couple of minor errors . "" If she did really make any errors in the prizewinner 's concert , these would have gone unnoticed to the general audience . In a successful dialogue with Bernard Haitink and the orchestra , Vilde Frang delivered the perfect rendition ; in other words , one with tension , one with emotionality , with her - in the words of Ingeborg Waldinger in the Austrian daily Wiener Zeitung - totally unique , poetic voice : fire and ice , strength and silence . The violin concerto in D minor , op . 47 , by Jean Sibelius is not new to Vilde Frang 's repertoire . She recorded it for EMI in March 2009 with the WDR Cologne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Thomas Søndergård . Her CD can therefore be purchased and compared with the concert being broadcast on Radio DRS2 at 20:00 on Thursday , December 13 . How has she developed over these past three-and-a-half years ? Has her playing become more mature , more grown-up , ( even ) better ? Mention such ideas and Vilde Frang looks at you with her incredibly big round eyes and at the same time smiles warmly . First , growing up is very dangerous . You do at least have to try to keep the spontaneity of childhood alive in your adult life , she says ; second , who would want to play the love of a 22-year-old off against that of a 26-year-old ? "" A piece of music changes and almost grows with you . It 's no different than with love "" , she explains . "" With a word like love , we also associate very different things depending on the experiences and phase in life that we 're going through . In precisely the same way , we can constantly identify new aspects in a piece of music . "" Although this represents a progression , it is only vaguely subsumable with the concept of quality . Vilde Frang combines the music of Sibelius and its expression of melancholy and desolation with the Nordic landscapes in which she was raised , and which represent a significant element of her identity even though she has lived in Munich for a number of years now . Incidentally , she debuted at the Lucerne Festival on September 15 , 2009 , with the work of the Finnish composer when she interpreted the three humoresques of Sibelius , among other works , with pianist Julien Quentin . This performance had its origins in a less successful experience in Lucerne : In spring 2004 , she reached the final of the Eurovision Young Musicians contest in Lucerne but went home empty-handed . Even so , back then she managed to make a positive impression on jury member Michael Haefliger , Artistic and Executive Director of Lucerne Festival . If it 's true that we learn most from failure , Vilde Frang benefited enormously from this one - which was n't actually a failure in any case : Her musical future belongs to her , and it finally began with the 2012 prizewinner 's concert .

"international arena , leading the way to new financing opportunities for challenged institutions in the current market environment . Islamic finance encompasses the reconciliation of financial activities and Islamic law . The Sharia is based on various spiritual and legal sources , most importantly the Quran and the Sunnah . The Quran is a fully codified text that , to Muslims , represents the word of God . The Sunnah refers to the way of life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , which is partly reported and should be followed by all Muslims . Since Muhammad himself was a tradesman at a certain stage of his life , the Quran and the Sunnah contain detailed advice and rules on how Muslims should act economically . At the center of these advises is the prohibition of Riba , which means interest or usury in Arabic . Consequentially , the absence of interest is a crucial requirement to any kind of Islamic financial transaction . The prohibition of interest is not an exclusive feature of Islam . Most monotheistic religions have regarded interest with distrust at one time or another . In ancient Judaism and Christianity , taking interest was considered a sin . To both religious communities , it took centuries to advance their religious conventions in order to make interest-based financial activities socially acceptable . In Jewish tradition , this process has been mainly facilitated by the permission of interest-based lending to non-Jews and the Christians ' claim that Jewish people should be charged with the handling of financial affairs . For Christians , restrictions on dealing with interest were maintained until the end of the Middle Ages . Here , it was basically an intellectualized discourse on the time value of money that has led to a changing perception of interest within the Christian community . The critical attitude towards interest , however , is still reflected in national laws today . In the USA , for example , so-called usury statutes define the maximal interest rate that can be claimed on loans . The prohibition of interest is not the only thing that differentiates conventional from Islamic finance . The regulations also dictate the handling of risk and speculation , gambling-like situations and a classification of "" good "" and "" bad "" business sectors . The rules on risk and speculation underline the need of sustainable growth for local economies . The prohibition of gambling-like situations stems from the fact that in pre-Islamic Mecca , gambling for soft commodities was very popular . While some players benefited from the values gained , others ended up highly indebted . It is said that the prophet Muhammad aimed at increasing social cohesion among Islamic believers and therefore fought the gambling-like practices that enlarged the gap between the rich and the poor . Moreover , Islamic finance became famous for its application of a so-called negative screening approach . Since the emergence of the sector , religious scholars have started to define business sectors that are in the spirit of Islam and the ones that are classified as non-Islamic . Today , the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index , the best known benchmark index for Islamic equities , identifies the following business sectors as not compliant with Islam : the production of alcohol- , tobacco- and pork-related products , conventional financial services , the entertainment sector , as well as the weapons and defense industry . In addition to that , highly indebted companies are excluded , because Islamic scholars argue that equity must be preferred over debt . The idea of considering Sharia principles for the structuring of financial transactions emerged among Egyptian intellectuals in the middle of the twentieth century . At this stage in history , the Middle East was not a wealthy region and thus , the first Islamic finance experiments did not gain attention on a supra-regional level . In the 1970s , however , when the oil crisis led to tremendous amounts of new wealth in the Middle East , the idea of Sharia-compliant finance was taken up again . Since then , a number of institutions in the Middle East and South East Asia have steadily worked on developing an Islamic form of economic action . These institutions were mainly located in the Gulf countries and enjoyed strong support by the Islamic Development Bank that was founded in 1973 . In the 1980s , Islamic financial services became increasingly popular in South East Asia . In contrast to the Middle Eastern markets , where Islamic financial institutions mainly focused on wealthy private banking clients and private equity activities , South East Asian Islamic financial institutions started to establish a stronger focus on retail clients . Still , until the end of the twentieth century , Islamic finance offered fairly limited opportunities to its practitioners . Since direct interest was forbidden , a complete banking service that goes beyond equity investing could not be offered to Islamic clients . This , however , changed in the new millennium , when Islamic institutions started to put more effort into research and development . Afterwards , the Islamic fixed income market grew , Islamic mortgages became more popular , Sharia-compliant credit cards were offered . At the end of the last decade , Islamic market participants could finally benefit from a fully-fledged Islamic financial service sector . In the first decade of the new millennium , Sukuk became very popular among companies based in the Middle East and South East Asia to raise capital in financial markets . The expression Sukuk - often translated as Islamic bond - is the plural of the Arabic word Sakk , that stands for deed or legal document . Etymologically , the word has the same roots as the English word check and refers to the old tradition of issuing legal documents to verify outstanding debt . The word Sukuk , a number of checks , has therefore been used to describe the first attempts to create Islamic fixed income products . While from 2002 to 2005 there where annually less than fifty new Sukuk issued globally , the amount of new issues increased to 398 in 2010 . This massive increase took place for various reasons : First , it has been driven by the growing transparency of the way Sukuk are structured . To avoid interest payments that are normally applied for conventional fixed income products , Sukuk generally rely on highly complex legal and cash flow structures . After the Islamic financial market had to deal with a number of defaults , frameworks of Sukuk have been stress-tested and improved . Further , the demand for Sukuk has been stimulated by the growing number of Islamic equity investors that enhanced their religion-based approach to fixed income products . Finally , another important development has recently boosted the Sukuk market : To raise capital in the Islamic world , various non-Islamic companies have started to issue Sukuk that enable Islamic investors to purchase fixed income products of non-Islamic companies . The first non-Islamic Sukuk issuer was the German state Saxony-Anhalt . With the pioneering idea to raise capital in the Islamic financial market , Saxony-Anhalt significantly enlarged its potential investors ' base in 2004 . Since then , companies like General Electric , Hewlett Packard or Petronas issued Sukuk to raise Islamic capital . The launch of the recent Goldman Sachs Sukuk signals that even established financial institutions are currently considering this step . This does not come as a surprise . Due to the current belt-tightening in the USA and in Europe , to some companies , raising capital in the Middle East and South East Asia might be to only way to stay liquid in future . Since the late 1980s , the term globalization has been used to describe the increasing international production and circulation of goods , services and ideas . While many of the goods and services today are provided by emerging markets , the ideas are generally still produced by western political and financial institutions . Here , Islamic finance is a powerful counterexample . The idea of a Sharia-compliant way of banking and finance originated in the Middle East and has been mainly developed and promoted by Middle Eastern and South East Asian actors and institutions . The fact that non-Islamic companies have taken up the idea of Islamic finance and are now looking for Islamic financial products to raise capital , does not follow the traditional pattern of globalization . It is , by contrast , a sign of the emergence of a multipolar world , which will no longer be governed by established markets exclusively . Without any doubt , this development towards a multipolar world is currently accelerated by the ongoing financial crisis and the need of western-based companies to raise new capital from new sources .",human
"financial center is facing , whether from Singapore , Hong Kong or Dubai , which are all located in high-growth regions and less exposed to international political pressure . Other challenges faced by the Swiss banks include increasing fiscal pressure on the Swiss cross-border private banking sector and the eroding profitability of private banking . The regulatory developments taking place abroad , particularly in the US and EU , also have a fundamental impact on the Swiss financial center . The US and EU increasingly demand that Swiss financial services providers respect their national rules for access to their respective markets . The Swiss financial center is currently on the defensive and needs to undertake concerted efforts to reverse this trend . The report calls upon Swiss financial institutions , policy makers , supervisory authorities and academics to endorse change and take proactive measures to be able to thrive in the new economic and regulatory environment that is evolving around them . This strategy should embrace a business model solely based on tax-compliant money - any other business model will fail . The regularization of the past is indispensable and on-going through the negotiation of tax treaties with key partner nations . The setting-up of a withholding tax agreement on future capital gains generated on assets invested in Switzerland is the proper and most sensible way to go . Swiss banks should notably seize the opportunities to reap a greater share of the banking needs of Swiss companies . Today , the country 's 100 largest firms are estimated to carry out banking transactions generating around 10 billion Swiss francs in annual revenues - less than a fifth is captured by Swiss banks . There is no reason why Swiss banks should not be more active in the hedging of Swiss corporates ' currencies , interest rate and commodity risks , and the clearing of their cash and trading flows . Swiss banks could also capture a greater market share in trade finance - an area of crucial importance for a country whose exports make up 54 percent of its GDP . These significant trade flows trigger the need for banking services such as currency exchange , credit protection and export finance . Another area of potential growth is corporate financing . An increasing number of Swiss companies finance themselves on the capital markets - a direct consequence of the tougher regulatory capital requirements which curbs the banks ' ability to lend to the economy . Swiss banks should also be encouraged to finance innovative companies and start-ups , notably using new forms of financing such as crowd funding . Within Switzerland , there is also scope to develop business opportunities with the banks ' retail and private banking clients in the areas of electronic and mobile banking by offering new innovative products and services . The adoption of appropriate national legislation needs to be encouraged so that Swiss banks are able to leverage the afore-mentioned opportunities . Switzerland today acts as a global hub for charitable foundations , with supervised assets estimated at 70 billion Swiss francs . Swiss banks could tap into new and interesting business lines , by broadening the available products and services in the areas of philanthropy , microfinance , sustainable investments and impact investing . More could also be done to attract investment managers - hedge funds - and fund administration to relocate in Switzerland . Swiss banks could gain a significant market share in this growing alternative investment industry , through investments in infrastructure , the provision of a favorable regulatory environment - particularly through a streamlined registration process for new funds . Swiss banks should also provide their corporate clients with improved access to the new growth markets located in Asia , the Middle East and in Latin America . They need to expand their local presence in these regions , so that the resulting business opportunities can be fully exploited . There will , for instance , be extraordinary trade and investment flow with corresponding opportunities for globally active banks . This triggers a need to invest in infrastructure , as few banks are currently in a position to offer global corporate banking services and to handle complex financial flows between developed and emerging markets . Many individuals and companies from these emerging powers may also prefer to carry out some of their banking business in neutral territory - another chance for Swiss banks . Further opportunities exist in international commodities trading . Finally , various currencies , especially the Chinese renminbi , are currently developing into major , internationally traded currencies , providing further opportunities . Switzerland could also aim at becoming the data and infrastructure backbone of the global financial services industry , by investing in excellent and reliable technical infrastructure and business systems for data storage and processing . These could range from the booking and administering of mutual funds and hedge funds , to clearing , settlement and technical infrastructure for alternative exchanges to a real-time global platform for cash management and payments . The common theme of all these long-term opportunities is to embrace a structural change of the Swiss financial services industry through better advice and , new and innovative products , in order to strengthen Switzerland 's position as a financial center . At the beginning of September 2012 , Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner presented a reform agenda named "" Switzerland as a Financial Center "" , which is aimed at prompting a constructive debate with all of the financial sector 's relevant stakeholders . The measures proposed in the report will hopefully result in concerted actions of both the private and the official sector creating a stable environment and avoiding excessive regulation .

"is lower than in other recoveries . Neal Soss , Credit Suisse 's Vice Chairman of Global Fixed Income and Economics Research , says that it 's not unusual to have periods of sluggish growth after a major financial crisis , as governments , businesses , financial institutions , and consumers retrench . The danger arises if that retrenchment phase drags on for too long . At that point , mediocre growth can start to feel more permanent , and businesses will feel a declining incentive to invest in the possibility of expansion . What 's more , the skills of the long-term unemployed can atrophy to the point that they verge on being permanently unemployable . "" The downside to an episode of this sort - if that sluggish growth continues - is n't just the slower growth itself . It 's that the potential of the economy will deteriorate , "" he says . With no new fiscal or monetary stimulus on the horizon , there is concern among economists that world leaders are running that very risk . "" Most of the world is allergic to explicit fiscal stimulus and the public sector balance sheet leverage it implies , "" Credit Suisse 's fixed income analysts wrote in their most recent quarterly global economics survey . European officials have imposed stringent austerity requirements on Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Ireland in exchange for their various bailouts . A combination of tax increases and spending cuts over the last four years have reduced the US budget deficit from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 ( 1.4 trillion US dollars ) to a projected 3 percent ( 514 billion US dollars ) this year . Japan 's consumption tax rose from 5 percent to 8 percent without any accompanying monetary stimulus , a reflection of how eager Japanese policymakers are to shrink both the deficit and the public debt , which is twice the size of the economy . Meanwhile , Chinese authorities are trying to rein in local government spending by reducing credit availability , while Brazil pledged to cut its budget by 18.5 billion US dollars in February to meet a budget surplus target of 1.9 percent . Additional monetary stimulus seems equally unlikely . Most central bankers are keeping monetary policy accommodative , but the Federal Reserve is steadily winding down quantitative easing , and both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank have disappointed those who were confident they would ease further in the first quarter . Several countries are also implementing structural reforms that will cause further short-term pain in the hopes of increased economic potential five or more years down the line . China 's efforts to rebalance its economy toward domestic consumption , for example , will ultimately create a more sustainable growth model that does n't depend on ill-advised local government borrowing financed by shadow banking . The recent crackdown on official corruption is also a move in the right direction . But both moves have contributed to China 's declining GDP growth , which is even below the government 's own 7.5 percent forecast . The Reserve Bank of India , meanwhile , aims to bring inflation to 4 percent within two years , down from an average of 8.4 percent since 2005 . The "" extremely conservative "" policies required to achieve that will surely restrict growth , Credit Suisse economists say . If policymakers seem unlikely to kick-start the global economy , an increase in business spending could do the trick . The conditions are certainly ripe for it . At the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 , US businesses made record post-tax profits of 1.9 trillion US dollars , up 35 percent from the previous peak of 1.41 trillion US dollars in 2006 . Net corporate cash flow reached its highest-ever level in the third quarter of 2013 at 2.28 trillion US dollars . And yet , at 458.6 billion US dollars in the fourth quarter of 2013 , net private domestic business investment in the US was still below 2007 levels . "" Some of that , I suspect , is simply the passage of time , as confidence heals after the crisis we 've had , "" Soss says . "" But we 're apparently still lacking that something that will give business leadership the kind of confidence in the medium- and long-term future that gets cash out of their hands and turned into actual business activity . "" Maybe that something is an unexpected positive surprise , or maybe it 's a few more months of encouraging economic data - enough to prove this recovery is the real deal , even if it 's slower and weaker than we 'd have hoped .",human
"slowed substantially in recent decades , accompanied by higher life expectancy and lower birth rates . In 2030 , Switzerland will have a population of 7.9 million . By then , it is unlikely that the majority of the population will still be "" truly "" Swiss . Population growth continues to slow In 1964 the average woman had 2.68 children . However , the advent of the contraceptive pill reduced this rate to 1.5 children by the middle of the 1970s . Today , the fertility rate for Swiss women is 1.3 children , and by 2030 it will have declined further to 1.2 . In order to maintain a steady population , however , an average of 2.1 children is required per woman , a figure that is very close to the current fertility rate for non-Swiss women living in Switzerland . The highest birth rate is found in Appenzell Innerrhoden , with an average of 1.86 children per woman . Both men and women can also look forward to a longer life . The average life expectancy for men will increase from 76.7 to 81.8 years , while that for women will increase from 82.6 to 87.1 years . Switzerland thus has one of the world 's highest life expectancies , after Sweden and Japan . Dependency burden in Swiss cantons 2000-2030 The distance between home and work is growing The differences in population changes in the cantons largely reflect geographical phenomena such as the contrast between towns and the countryside and the growing distance between home and the workplace . Today , the cities are the real driving forces behind economic growth and , with their surrounding conurbations , are home to almost two thirds of Switzerland 's population . In cantons with large cities such as Zurich , value creation is generally much higher than income . The reason for this is the relatively large flow of commuters from other cantons . These people work in the major economic centres and thus generate value there . By contrast , incomes are much higher than added value where a significant number of commuters work outside the canton . Household income in Swiss cantons 1999-2004 Cantons offering the highest location quality and good transport links Cantons Zug , Zurich , Nidwalden and Schwyz have the highest location quality . The relatively low level of personal taxation is a key factor which is common to all four . In coming years these cantons will also have the highest rates of growth in private household income . All of them profit from having high-income age classes and a high employment ratio . Location Quality Indicator for Swiss cantons 2001 Cities are the main engines of growth Population changes in cantons Zug , Zurich and Schwyz , as well as Nidwalden , Basel-Land and Aargau , exemplify the pulling power of a nearby urban centre coupled with increased mobility . Geneva and Fribourg can also expect above-average growth . By contrast , demographic expansion will be weak in cantons Berne , Uri , Schaffhausen , Neuchâtel , Glarus and Jura . Glarus , Uri , Basel-City and Appenzell Ausserrhoden will see the sharpest population falls . More peripheral areas are thus lagging further and further behind , and this is also reflected in the sharp differences between rates of growth in household income .",human
", the significance is central . The financial markets allocate global resources more efficiently than other mechanisms , making money available to those who need it in the form of investments and allowing all to profit . This creates value . Yes , trillions that were first created in the markets . But in this context it is important to note that the tech bubble , which caused that destruction of value as it burst , hap pened in one part of the global financial markets , namely the stock market , and even there it hit some areas - tech , etc. - stronger than others . Even though it was possible in that time to mitigate the effects by having well-diversified portfolios across different asset classes , whose returns are more independent of each other . Exactly . That is where we come in. Expertise and experience are essential ingredients to the successful generation and maintenance of value in the financial markets , which is a fair definition of our business of asset management . It is our job to make sense of the increasingly complex and diverse financial markets and find the best way , not only of generating value for our clients , but also of managing their risk . It 's about finding a comprehensive solution . This brings us to the heart of the matter . There are a number of ways to make money , whereby it ca n't be said that one is better than the other , they 're just different . It is a question of what a given investor is more comfortable with . One investor looks at returns in relation to the returns on cash . This is what we call total return oriented . On the other hand there are investors who look at returns in relation to equity and bond markets . Both are going for positive returns , though on different time horizons . Total return investors want to see a positive return every year , and must be willing to sacrifice some longer term return for that . The one who is looking more toward market returns is willing to have negative years , but has a longer time horizon to capture the risk premium that financial markets offer . What is important in all this for any investor is to decide on a style - on an investment plan and then to stick with it . There will always be times when one style is outperforming the other and vice versa . If you keep switching , you are running after the action , dropping performance and increasing trans action costs . Switching is tied with risk . What is risk ? Risk is very subjective , meaning different things to different people . The fluctuation in the value of a portfolio is one form of risk , so is the probability of falling short of a certain return over the longer term . If you look at fluctuation , equities tend to be riskier than investment grade bonds . Some risk can be eliminated by diversification , or by spreading one 's investments across a number of asset classes , regions , countries , styles and issuers . The remaining risk is called systematic risk and cannot be eliminated . So , some portfolios remain riskier than others , but offer a higher return over the longer term . This is a general trade off - higher longer term returns mean on average that you need a longer investment horizon . Once an investor has decided what kind of risk level is acceptable , with our help or without , we can then help in using the risk level optimally . One thought in this context is that there is such a thing as over diversification , where the return of a portfolio is simply taken down to the market return , which may not be appropriate for a given investor 's goals and time horizon . Our profession is no more immune to mistakes than others . This is one reason that I , as CIO , insist on a structured investment process . Such a process has a number of advantages . Next to acting as a check on our work as investment professionals , it enables us to bring in all the different factors that determine the value of our asset classes into a holistic and consistent system . These factors take on many different forms , from so called soft factors to the outputs of highly sophisticated quantitative models . It is in the interpretation of these factors where the art of portfolio management lies . As CIO , I decide on the asset allocation in our discretionary mandates . Put simply , I determine whether we invest relatively more in bonds , equities , cash or alternative investments , also on the allocation of different sub asset classes , such as credits , hedge funds or private equity , regions , countries and styles , such as value or growth stocks . First of all , we are a whole team of different specialists who constantly monitor the mar kets and what influences them . We look at valuations , economic indicators , the output of a number of quantitative models as well as soft factors such as investor and business sentiment . All these factors flow into our investment process . We then take these results into a com mittee comprised of the most senior man agement of Credit Suisse , as well as other strategists in the bank . I then decide how to bring the output of this body into our mandate portfolios . All this takes place on a monthly basis , though if we deem some kind of action to be indicated outside of this cycle , we can certainly do so . A discretionary mandate is one of the most efficient ways of managing the assets of private clients . With their relationship managers the clients go through a detailed ad visory process which is designed to determine the needs of our clients as closely as possible . Of course some clients already have a very concrete concept when they come to us , which we can then take up . This way we learn how risk tolerant a client is and what kind of return expectations he or she has . We learn about preferred markets or asset classes , or securities and markets the client would rather exclude . We can determine the best mandate for the client , according to which we then manage his money . It depends on the type of mandate . Some mandates , which are available from a relatively small initial investment , are standardized to a certain degree . But even here , different risk return profiles , different regional focuses and different styles lead to a good degree of individualization . As investments grow bigger , we move into the realm of true customization , with the possibility of setting up a genuinely individual portfolio , with unique characteristics and its own benchmark . Putting it simply , yes . Obviously , this requires a great deal of trust on the client 's part and a great deal of discretion . As one of the largest Swiss banks with a 150 year history and as a leading global money manager we are well aware of our clients ' needs and expectations . And through our comprehensive and understandable reporting , we can give the clients full transparency into their investments at any time . As I said before , as CIO I am responsible for the asset allocation decisions , or the big picture of the markets and asset classes , though in previous jobs I also was responsible for stock and bond selection . I can say , however , that we are excited about the LEA ( Latin America , Eastern Europe , Asia ) regions . The growth engine of the world is clearly shifting from the developed countries to such countries as China , India , Brazil or Russia . We are getting in early and want to ride the growth curve over a 10 year horizon .",human
"revolutionary innovation was thoroughly praised in the press . For example , the Neue Zürcher Zeitung ( a Zurich daily newspaper ) provided motorists of the day with a practical instruction manual for the new facility : "" At the entrance to the bank , approaching cars trigger a sensor on the ground , activating a light trail that directs the driver to the next available counter . "" Anyone researching the history of drive-through banking soon traces its roots to the US . This is hardly surprising since the land of unlimited automotive opportunity also gave rise to a type of outdoor snack bar that allowed motorists to grab a quick bite to eat without ever leaving their set of wheels . But which came first - the drive-through bank or the drive-through restaurant ? It was in 1951 that Robert Oscar Peterson opened the world 's first drive-through restaurant at 6270 El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego , thus inventing the fast food industry . At least that 's the claim from fast food chain Jack in the Box , which was founded by Peterson . If that 's the case , then the concept of fast food lagged some 13 years behind "" fast banking "" . That 's because records show that the first drive-through bank opened in Dallas , Texas in 1938 . This new marketing channel came from the Hillcrest State Bank , an institution whose name has long been associated with the history of banking in the US . In Switzerland , the history of banking by car is much less convoluted . The idea got off to a good start : in just its first year of operation , the drive-through bank at Paradeplatz handled close to 20,000 clients . But the automobile , which had provided the impetus for launching a new line of business , was also responsible for triggering its downfall . In the seventies , downtown Zurich began to suffer more and more from the increase in traffic , and fewer and fewer bank clients were electing to make underground pit stops to fill up on cash . In 1983 SKA finally brought an end to the experiment , which had long been unprofitable . This could really have been the end of the chapter . But as this stormy technological development in the world of banking has revealed : once an idea has been introduced , it rarely disappears altogether - whether we 're talking about ATMs , making payment transactions by mail , or phone banking , not to mention the good old branches . For the very same reason , the drive-through bank has the potential to make a roaring comeback - in Switzerland , that is . For when it comes to the car-crazed Americans , drive-through banking has never waned in popularity since it was first introduced in Dallas 65 years ago . Whether Citibank , the Bank of America , or Bank One - they all continue to offer drive-through banking nationwide , be it normal ATMs right through to actual counters . In the meantime , drive-through banks are also beginning to establish themselves where the automobile has just celebrated its victory march : in the up and coming markets of Asia . Now , thanks to modern technology , none other than McDonald 's is poised to completely fuse the two concepts . Together with British Telecom , the hamburger giant has set up Wireless Fidelity Access Zones in some 500 of its restaurants in the UK in the past year . These zones allow customers to use their own notebooks or handhelds to establish wireless broadband access to the internet , thereby availing themselves of the full range of modern internet banking services . This move targets harried business people who prefer to look after everything at once from their mobile offices : listening to the radio , phoning , writing e-mails , making appointments , checking share prices , trading securities - all the while munching on a Quarter Pounder , of course . This sets the stage for development of the next innovation : the ketchup-resistant notebook .",human
"can overcome its self-evident problems . For too long it has been the forgotten Continent but it is now growing significantly and - providing it has the support necessary to deal with its problems - has a future that can overcome the difficulties it has faced in the past . Obviously Nelson Mandela is an iconic figure , and Kofi Annan has represented Africa in a key position in the United Nations . And , of course , President Mubarak of Egypt has been an international figure for many years . The European approach to Africa varies from country to country , but overall it is rather disappointing . A number of European countries are very active in the provision of aid , or conflict prevention , or dealing with vital issues such as the export of drugs and counter-terrorism . There is still a significant amount of trade between old established trade partners , most noticeably those countries that once had a Colonial relationship . One difficulty in the current relationship is that of old resentments that remain from those Colonial days , although in most cases these are now fading significantly . I believe there should be a much greater symbiosis between Africa and Europe . For Africa , Europe is a huge market for its raw materials and other products , whereas Africa presents an astonishing long-term investment prospect for European capital . China is very active in nearly all parts of Africa , especially in countries such as Sudan or Angola where the Chinese have significant contracts to buy oil . But it is doing more than that . China is developing infrastructure projects , often tied to aid , using Chinese partners and contractors and in so doing , improving African infrastructure . Chinese interest in natural resources extends beyond oil to the minerals and forests of the Congo , and arable products in a number of other countries . This appears to be a developing long-term relationship of great significance . At the moment economic growth across Africa averages at around 6 percent , with Angola the fastest growing country in the world at the present time . I believe it is very likely that Africa can begin to close the gap on growth with the mature countries of the West due , predominantly , to the enormous demand there will continue to be for the Continent 's commodities : food , oil and other natural resources . But it will take a long time before the prosperity gap can be closed with much of the rest of the world . The experience of Latin America over the last two decades shows that it can be narrowed within a generation . However , to achieve this , some of the fundamental problems facing Africa will have to be addressed , such as political stability , AIDS , and , to a lesser extent , climate change which could adversely affect food production . The Continent of Africa is enormously diverse and so are its strengths . Predominantly , of course , there is an abundance of oil , minerals and arable products , as well as the potential of human resources . These do , however , vary widely between countries . The biggest dangers facing Africa are political instability and ancient feuds . Political stability - the elimination of corruption in a number of countries - seems to me to be the essential pre-requisite for sustained growth and an improvement in the quality of life for Africans . In recent decades , too much of African wealth has been dissipated instead of being used to underpin continuing prosperity . Sport can make a significant contribution to bringing people together . From what I have seen of Africans , they have a great affinity for sports . Consider , for example , South African cricket ; or the remarkable athletes of Kenya and Ethiopia ; or the success in soccer of the African Nations Cup , many of whose stars flourish in premiership games in the United Kingdom . Sport is a great unifier . I would very much like to travel to South Africa for the FIFA World Cup in 2010 but cannot yet be certain that I will be able to do so . However , what I can be certain of is that I will be visiting that and other countries in Africa before then . Such trips will - as always - give me enormous personal pleasure .",human
"States during World War II as a child prodigy until the age of 15 . Some 30 years later , I came back to the New York Philharmonic as an adult and began a new relationship based on something considerably more solid . This relationship culminated into the music directorship which I am enjoying today . Not until my early 20s . I had spent most of my childhood as a musician learning to play the violin , piano and clarinet and studying composing . In my late teens , I felt there must be many other things that I did not have an opportunity to explore , including literature , history , philosophy and languages . So , I put myself through night school at the University of Pittsburgh . I worked during the day by playing violin in the Pittsburgh Symphony . I joined not for the purpose of widening my dimension as a musician , but for the purpose of earning money to put myself through school . Little did I know that those performances would turn out to be decisive for me because I was playing under some of the most famous conductors of the day , and I was learning a great deal from them without realizing it . They were convincing me that my future would lie in music , just as my past did . Fame is what other people think of you and about you . It is being known outside your own private circle of family and friends , but it is really an extension of that . If you are known by 50 people or 50 million people , what 's the difference ? Seen that way , fame is no more or less important than being known by your inner circle . Most people , however , do n't see it that way and they attach some kind of value to fame that it does n't have . I was quite famous - if that is what you want to call it - as a child . Some people have said that I was forgotten . I was n't forgotten . It was just that people saw no more reason to be interested in Lorin Maazel as a young adult . The Lorin Maazel they knew was a boy in short pants with black curly hair looking very serious conducting famous orchestras and masterpieces . That person was gone . With the disappearance of that person went knowledge of him and his fame . Therefore I learned early that fame is ephemeral . People are forever talking about legacies and a place in history , but that is total nonsense . Even the shortest view of history will show us that there have been hundreds and thousands of great artists , poets and musicians who have been forgotten . To be overly focused on questions of posterity and legacy , of having a place in history , is a waste of time . It is an egomaniacal exercise irrelevant to the purpose for which performers should be concerned . We are there to communicate what it is that we know about the music with people at a given moment . To the degree that we are successful , people react positively . If we are successful in doing so time and time again we become famous , but that fame will soon evaporate and folks wo n't remember our names 30 years from now , nor should they . We are people of the moment . I suppose we all are , but especially performers . Only people who know nothing about music become critics . Therefore , the opinions of critics mean nothing to me . What personality traits does a successful conductor have to possess ? There are certain natural aptitudes , such as excellent memory and preferably perfect pitch , which is the ability to identify the number of vibrations each note has so that you are able to identify the note itself . You also need the ability to perform publicly , believing in the people for whom you are performing , and you must have the desire to open musical vistas for them and give them pleasure as listeners . And , one must also have respect for the great composers who have given us the music that we perform . That is why we are there . It is my job to help the musicians to feel that all of the years they have put into practicing their instruments and the hours they have to put in every day to stay fit technically , has a purpose and is worthwhile . Actually , the first thing you try to do is meet their expectations professionally in order to gain their respect . You ca n't impose respect , you have to win it . The second area is motivating them musically . You have to feel that the music you are asking them to make is based on some kind of musical logic on a purposeful utilization of musical instinct . Each musician also has his own way of making music and to express himself . I try as hard as I can to incorporate a personal musical view into a larger structure . If I disagree fundamentally with a musical viewpoint entertained by an individual soloist , I will speak to him or her quietly about it and explain my reasons . Nine times out of 10 , what your first chair players have to offer is of the highest order . I love incorporating their individuality of expression into that larger structure , and to come up with a kaleidoscope of colors and phrasings that mesh very well because of the guiding hand of the conductor , who is thinking about timing and structure . I believe that classical music − having come from a certain religiosity where compassion for the masses is underlined in requiems − has the power to touch people on a very emotional level . That is a big task for any undertaking , but classical music can come closer to a universal appeal than any other activity . In responding to classical music , people from different classes do find common ground . There are moments engraved in my mind that bring that forth , for example the first time the Star-Spangled Banner , the national anthem of the United States , was played by the New York Philharmonic in North Korea in February 2008 to an audience of mostly Korean government officials . They cheered when it was over . That was an extraordinary event . I do n't think any greater example can be given of bringing people together through music − though the Star-Spangled Banner is not a classical work . I try to support organizations that are apolitical , but they are very difficult to find . I do believe that art and artists should be divorced from partisan politics or political tilts . If I give my services , I try to do it for a specific issue , such as for children who need important inoculations against diseases . I am planning to devote more of my time to such issues , starting in 2010 . I have performed in many countries in which the political stance leaves something to be desired in the area of human rights . Yet , the people 's response to our music is so indicative of the state of mind of the people as opposed to the government which rules them and the positions they take . I remember giving a concert for the UN in New York City with a Russian soloist and the Pittsburgh Symphony at the height of the Cold War . After the performance we walked out arm-in-arm and I stopped the applause and said : "" Here you have an American conductor and orchestra making music with a Russian . If we can get together , why do n't you folks out there emulate our example ? "" Keep in mind that I said this to a room full of diplomats from around the world . My statement was met with deathly silence and I thought I 'd overstepped my bounds and , yet again , let my tongue get the best of me . After what seemed like ages , everyone stood up and began cheering . They saw my point . If the world of music can get along , they should also consider finding common ground , instead of building obstacles . Of course there are differences between culture , between economic and political interest and questions of historical conflict , but all this can be ironed out . Classical music is not dying as some people might think . It may be faltering among the tired , aging , American upper-middle class , but it is certainly not in Europe or in Asia . In Japan , for example , the interest in classical music has tripled or quadrupled in the last 25 years . In China this year during our Asian tour , most of the concerts were packed with people under 30 and I saw families with young children listening in awe . Our program is very challenging and we are closing the season with Gustav Mahler 's "" Symphony of a Thousand . "" We will also perform a piece that is very close to my heart , Benjamin Britten 's "" War Requiem "" that tells the story of two enemies who meet after death and mull over the futility of war . This is a piece that I will be performing in my penultimate week in June 2009 . It is a piece that I hope to be performing quite often because it carries a message that is dear to me . It is a political statement of sorts on my part , but it is primarily a musical masterpiece . My last season with the Philharmonic will be a sentimental journey , though I am very happy that I decided at the beginning of my tenure that I would stay with the orchestra for seven years only . That is the same number of years that Arturo Toscanini stayed with the orchestra as music director . Seven also happens to be my lucky number . So , I will be leaving with a light heart , knowing that the orchestra will continue on its successful course . We will again be making music together in the 2011-12 and the 2012-13 seasons . That seems very far off , but in our world that is like the day after tomorrow . I will go back to composing more . And I will pick up with old friends that I left behind seven years ago , including the Vienna Philharmonic and London 's Philharmonia Orchestra among others . However , I wo n't be conducting as much because I need more time to write music . There have been so many moments in my life . I feel very , very fortunate . One should be grateful for many things , primarily health . All the rest is a bonus on top of that . Why so many people are depressed in this day and age is beyond me . Every day is an important day for me . Having said that , my memory is filled with glorious performance moments − what the Germans call Sternstunden ( magic moments ) . To single just one out and to say that was the greatest moment of my professional life would be very difficult . Contrary to what many believe , I am not a workaholic at all . If my life had been nothing but giving concerts , preparing for them and rehearsing , I think I really would be depressed . I am a lover of life and have visited almost every corner of the earth . I have been to some really exotic places as a tourist , as a younger person when I had very little money . Traveling with little money gives a tremendous sense of freedom , which is quite wonderful . I find that being affluent weighs you down a bit . I have done a lot of returns to nature for extended periods , and they have stabilized my life . I am so grateful for the many times I have disappeared into nature and had a marvelous time . I do not have to construct a "" bucket list "" and have a film made about the things I still have to do before I die , like my look-a-like Jack Nicholson . I go into my twilight years with no regrets .",human
"2,500 IT specialists more each year . National Councilor Ruedi Noser , vice president of ICTswitzerland , would like to see the ICT professional training program "" create more than 1,000 new apprenticeships "" in Switzerland by 2015 , setting an ambitious goal for himself and his umbrella organization . The "" ICT Professional Education Switzerland "" program is intended to address deficiencies and shortcomings in professional education in the IT industry in Switzerland in a targeted manner . By analyzing current opportunities for professional education and summarizing them in a quantitative study , the umbrella organization ICTswitzerland is taking a first step toward laying the foundation for planning and implementing a long-term and comprehensive program for professional education in Switzerland . By the end of the year , existing regional organizations of IT technology employers and other stakeholders will work with ICTswitzerland to form a national professional organization recognized by the federal government that will ensure the long-term management , operation , and financing of professional education for IT under the terms of the new Professional Training Act . Andreas Kaelin , president of the Swiss IT Leadership Forum , will direct the program . In the initial phase of the program , CHF 1.5 million has been budgeted to launch the project , with half already on hand and the other half requested from the Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology ( BBT ) in mid-December . A foundation for ICT Professional Education in Switzerland , financed in large part by Credit Suisse , aims to promote and support professional education in IT throughout Switzerland . The foundation will make it possible to get the program underway immediately and provide half of the project financing . If the project is successful , Credit Suisse will invest up to CHF 10 million in the foundation over the medium term . The goal is to find additional sponsors for the foundation , which is still in the process of being established , and to finance other projects in the area of ICT professional education . ICTswitzerland is pleased to have Credit Suisse , a leading IT organization in the financial industry in Switzerland and around the world , as a key partner in this project . With more than 4,000 IT employees in Switzerland , Credit Suisse is one of the largest and most important employers and partners in the IT industry . Credit Suisse 's efforts to highlight the significance of the IT labor market and increase its attractiveness are an ideal fit with the dedicated work ICTswitzerland does on behalf of ICT professional education in Switzerland . The close cooperation between Credit Suisse and ICTswitzerland has been bolstered even further with the nomination of Karl Landert , CIO at Credit Suisse , to the ICTswitzerland Executive Board . Credit Suisse itself is affected by the shortage of IT specialists in Switzerland - as are most financial services providers in the country . As Karl Landert , CIO at Credit Suisse , notes , "" We ca n't hire as many IT specialists as we would like , and we are currently seeking ambitious and focused professionals , particularly in application software development . We want to help highlight the significance of the IT labor market and increase its attractiveness - which will help us maintain the level of prosperity in Switzerland . Furthermore , a basic condition for continued economic success is a well-trained workforce , including IT employees . This is vital for Credit Suisse , as almost every fourth job at the bank is an IT job . However , financial firms are not alone - companies in every sector and of every size , from SMEs to large firms , need more IT specialists . The IT professional education project therefore seeks to meet the needs of all stakeholders and thus provide added value to the entire economy .",human
