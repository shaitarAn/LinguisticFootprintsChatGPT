"This case is of a middle-aged businessman who presented with chest pain that worsened with exertion. It is important to note that he had no history of smoking, alcoholism, or substance abuse. Additionally, there was no known exposure to tuberculosis (TB) or COVID-19 in his family or close contacts, and he had not recently traveled abroad. However, twenty days prior to the onset of symptoms, he had traveled by a domestic airline.  Upon examination, his vital signs were notable for a pulse rate of 108 per minute and arterial blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. His respiratory rate was elevated at 30 breaths per minute.  The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) on room air was 89%, which significantly dropped by 70% after exertion. On auscultation (listening with a stethoscope), crepitation sounds were detected on bilateral middle lung lobes—indicative of abnormal crackling sounds caused by tiny air sacs in the lungs filling with fluid.  Given these findings and the suspicion for concurrent TB and COVID-19 infections due to his recent domestic travel history and clinical presentation, further investigations were advised. These included a chest radiograph (PA-view), sputum microscopy using Ziehl Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli—a common method to identify mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis—and a Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) on the sputum sample. To assess for COVID-19 infection specifically, qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from an oropharyngeal swab was recommended.  Surprisingly, both TB-specific tests revealed presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum samples while confirming absence of Rifampicin resistance—the first-line anti-TB medication. Furthermore, PCR testing confirmed RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2—the virus responsible for COVID-19.  The chest radiograph showed bilateral consolidations in the middle lung fields with ill-defined borders—suggestive of areas of infection and inflammation. Additional laboratory investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count, increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All these are non-specific markers of infection and inflammation.  To further confirm the diagnosis, a sputum sample was sent for liquid culture using MGIT BACTEC method, which eventually showed growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis—the gold standard test for TB diagnosis. However, due to cost-effectiveness and patient preference against performing a computed tomography (CT) scan, this diagnostic procedure was not pursued.  Since the patient met both TB and COVID-19 criteria, he was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center where he received appropriate care following national guidelines. In addition to managing his confirmed COVID-19 infection, he also initiated four-drug antitubercular treatment according to the guidelines set by the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP).  Post-treatment completion at the designated center, follow-up evaluations were recommended; however, as mentioned in the case description, the patient has not yet reported back for follow-up.  It is worth noting that written informed consent was obtained from this patient prior to using his clinical data and images for publication purposes in this study. These findings demonstrate a unique case where simultaneous TB and COVID-19 infections were diagnosed based on clinical history, examination findings supported by various diagnostic tests specific to each disease. Proper management according to national guidelines is crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes for patients with dual infections like these.",explain
"Title: Successful Treatment of Congenital Vaginal Agenesis: A Case Report  Introduction: Congenital vaginal agenesis is a rare condition where the lower third segment of the vagina is absent, leading to various reproductive and psychosocial challenges. In this case report, we present the successful treatment of a patient diagnosed with congenital vaginal agenesis using perineal vaginoplasty.  Case Presentation: A young adult female presented with pelvic pain and an unusual finding during vaginal examination. Instead of the introitus, a vaginal cup was observed, suggesting hematometrocolpos. Ultrasonography confirmed a normal-sized uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervix along with fluid retention in the emptiness line of the uterus and upper third segment of the vagina related to hematometrocolpos. Pelvic MRI further revealed morphological changes consistent with congenital vaginal agenesis.  Diagnosis and Decision-making: Hormonal analysis indicated no abnormalities, and karyotype analysis showed 46XX constitution ruling out any chromosomal anomalies. With these findings, congenital vaginal agenesis on functional uterus was diagnosed as per standard clinical criteria.  Treatment Approach: The patient's legal guardian provided informed consent for treatment after being counseled about fertility prognosis. The surgical intervention chosen was perineal vaginoplasty which involved several steps:  1. Vaginal Traction: The upper two-thirds of normally formed vagina were gently pulled downwards externally. 2. Subcutaneous Fixation: The traction allowed for subcutaneous fixation (suturing) in order to form a neo-introitus. 3. Incision and Dissection: A transverse incision through the existing vaginal cup removed fibrous masking material till normal tissues were reached. 4. Blood Drainage: Any collected blood from hematometrocolpos was drained. 5. Uterine Evaluation: Hysterometer insertion ensured uterine emptiness and normal bottom length. 6. Vaginal Mucosal Repair: The normal vaginal mucosa was repositioned and attached radially to the subcutaneous border with single points spaced 5 mm apart. 7. Probing and Re-epithelialization: Silicone vaginal probes lubricated with estrogen gel were used to keep the new introitus open until re-epithelialization of tissues occurred. 8. Post-operative Care: Cicatrisation was completed within four weeks, and counseling on sexual health was provided.  Outcome: The patient experienced a remarkable improvement in symptoms, including regular menstrual cycles and diminished pelvic pain. This successful intervention resulted in an improved quality of life for the patient, who subsequently reported a satisfying sex life alongside achieving pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby boy.  Conclusion: Perineal vaginoplasty is an effective surgical intervention for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis. This case report underscores the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate counseling on fertility prognosis, informed consent from legal guardians, meticulous surgical technique, diligent post-operative care, and comprehensive follow-up for optimal outcomes.  Ethical Considerations: This case report has undergone ethics approval prior to publication. Written informed consent was obtained from both the patient (or her legal guardian) allowing participation in this publication as well as consenting to image usage. Copies of these consents are available upon request by the Editor-in-Chief.  Keywords: Congenital vaginal agenesis; hematometrocolpos; perineal vaginoplasty; reproductive health; case report Discussion:  Congenital vaginal agenesis, also known as Müllerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a rare developmental disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus. The reported incidence of MRKH syndrome is approximately 1 in 4,500 female births.  The specific cause of MRKH syndrome is not fully understood but is believed to involve genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in several genes involved in embryonic development are thought to contribute to this condition. In most cases, MRKH syndrome occurs sporadically without any clear familial pattern; however, there have been some reports of familial clustering.  Clinically, patients with MRKH syndrome typically present with primary amenorrhea during adolescence due to the absence of menstrual bleeding. Most patients have normally functioning ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics. However, vaginal agenesis can lead to reproductive challenges such as infertility and difficulty with sexual intercourse.  In this case report, the patient presented with hematometrocolpos resulting from obstructed menstrual flow due to absent lower third segment of the vagina. Hematometrocolpos refers to blood collection within the uterus and upper portion of the vagina that results from menstrual blood unable to exit due to an obstruction.  To address both functional and psychological concerns associated with genital anomalies like MRKH syndrome, a multidisciplinary approach combining gynecology, psychology/psychiatry and fertility counseling is essential. Prioritizing patient education about their diagnosis along with establishing realistic expectations regarding fertility options play a crucial role in their overall care.  Perineal vaginoplasty has emerged as a reliable surgical intervention for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis who desire restoration of vaginal function for sexual activity or potential reproduction through assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) using gestational surrogacy or traditional surrogacy.  The perineal vaginoplasty technique described in this case involved traction of the upper two-thirds of normally formed vagina and subcutaneous fixation to create a neo-introitus. The removal of fibrous masking material, drainage of collected blood, and repositioning of normal vaginal mucosa not only resolved the hematometrocolpos but also allowed for improved sexual function.  Post-operative care involves maintaining vaginal patency during re-epithelialization. This is achieved by using silicone vaginal probes lubricated with estrogen gel, which helps prevent adhesions and promotes epithelial growth. Close follow-up after surgery is crucial to address any complications or concerns, ensure proper healing, and provide comprehensive support for psychosocial well-being.  The successful outcome presented in this case report underlines the effectiveness of perineal vaginoplasty as a treatment option for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis. Regular menstrual cycles and alleviation of pelvic pain suggest that fertility may be possible through assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF or surrogacy.  Moreover, the patient's reported satisfaction with her sex life highlights the positive impact such interventions can have on quality-of-life outcomes. The ability to experience pregnancy and childbirth further exemplifies how effective management can restore hope regarding family planning options in these individuals.  Conclusion:  Congenital vaginal agenesis represents a complex condition that requires integrated care involving gynecology, psychology/psychiatry counseling, fertility specialists, surgeons experienced in reconstructive techniques like perineal vaginoplasty, along with empathetic nursing support. By providing early diagnosis, thorough counseling on fertility prognosis based on individual circumstances, well-executed surgical interventions supplemented by optimal post-operative care including psychosocial support; healthcare professionals can significantly improve patients' overall wellbeing and reproductive outcomes within this clinical context.

"The clinical case presented involves a patient with an initial differential diagnosis of pneumonia, heart failure, and COVID-19. The chest radiograph showed para-hilar opacities and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Further evaluation through chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass changes typically seen in viral pneumonia. The electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia and diffuse nonspecific disturbances of ventricular repolarization.  Upon admission, laboratory-based tests were conducted which revealed normal hemoglobin levels and platelet count. However, there were indications of inflammation syndrome as evidenced by an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level. Blood and urine cultures came back negative, but there were abnormal results for lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer levels indicating possible liver and renal dysfunction.  Markers of myocardial injury such as elevated troponin I (Trop I) levels and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) were also observed. Despite two negative nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 taken one day apart, suspicion for the viral infection remained high given the presence of multiple clinical, biological, and radiological indicators.  Bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed an enlarged left ventricle with segmental myocardial hypokinesis contributing to a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Coronary angiography ruled out obstructive atherosclerosis lesions in the coronary artery. Although most etiologic analyses for this dilated cardiomyopathy yielded no significant findings initially.  Further testing using ELISA demonstrated evidence of recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based on positive IgM antibodies while IgG antibodies were negative. An extensive biological screening was undertaken to investigate other potential causes of acute hepatitis including ruling out drug-induced or autoimmune hepatitis among others.  Cardiac MR-scan performed on Day 6 revealed subepicardial enhancement in the lateral free-wall of the left ventricle, suggestive of CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis. The patient's hepatitis and pulmonary lesions were likely consequences of primary CMV infection. Treatment involved managing cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure with intravenous inotropic agents and diuretics, without requiring antiviral medication.  After two days, the patient showed clinical improvement, prompting initiation of supportive medications including oral administration of ramipril, bisoprolol, furosemide, and spironolactone. Over the next week, there was steady progress as liver enzyme levels decreased along with markers related to infection. After 13 days of hospitalization and further assessments such as electrocardiogram readings, chest CT scans and echocardiography returned to normal.  Upon discharge under bisoprolol and ramipril medication regimen with no further episodes of breathlessness reported at a two-week follow-up appointment. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout this period.  In summary, this clinical case involved a complex presentation initially suggesting pneumonia or heart failure but ultimately diagnosed as CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis based on acute clinical symptoms supported by specific laboratory findings. Timely intervention that included management for cardiogenic shock led to significant improvement in the patient's condition over subsequent weeks. The case presented here highlights the challenges in diagnosing a patient who presented with several overlapping symptoms and clinical features. Initially, the differential diagnosis included pneumonia, heart failure, and COVID-19 due to manifestations such as chest opacities on radiograph and ground-glass changes on computed tomography. However, despite negative nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19, the clinical team remained suspicious of its presence due to other supporting evidence.  Further investigations revealed specific laboratory findings that pointed towards CMV infection as the underlying cause of fulminant myocarditis in this patient. The presence of elevated troponin I levels and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide indicated myocardial injury and impaired cardiac function. Additionally, there were signs of inflammation syndrome with an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level.  Serological testing using ELISA confirmed recent CMV infection based on positive IgM antibodies while IgG antibodies were negative. This information played a crucial role in establishing the diagnosis of CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis. It is important to note that most etiologic analyses for dilated cardiomyopathy initially yielded no significant findings.  The treatment approach focused on managing cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure with intravenous inotropic agents and diuretics while symptomatic treatment for liver dysfunction was initiated as well. Anti-viral medications were not required in this case; however, close monitoring was necessary to ensure improvement in cardiac function.  Throughout the hospitalization period, there was steady progress observed in this patient's condition. As liver enzyme levels decreased along with infection-related markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), it indicated a positive response to treatment interventions along with an improved overall prognosis.  After 13 days of hospitalization, follow-up assessments such as electrocardiogram readings demonstrated normal results confirming functional recovery of the heart muscle along with chest computed tomography scans showing resolution of lung abnormalities.  Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed bisoprolol and ramipril, both of which are commonly used in the management of heart failure to maintain optimal cardiac function. The absence of further episodes of breathlessness during the two-week follow-up indicated successful treatment and resolution of symptoms.   This case highlights the importance of conducting a thorough evaluation in patients presenting with overlapping symptoms and considering all possible differential diagnoses. It also demonstrates the significance of utilizing various diagnostic tools such as serological testing, cardiac imaging, and laboratory investigations to establish an accurate diagnosis.  Furthermore, this case emphasizes individualized treatment based on the underlying cause while addressing associated complications like liver dysfunction. The successful management ultimately led to clinical improvement and favorable outcomes for this patient.  In summary, through a comprehensive diagnostic approach along with prompt intervention using supportive medications targeted at managing cardiac-related issues, this patient experienced significant recovery from CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis alongside resolution of hepatic abnormalities and pulmonary manifestations. This case contributes to our understanding of similar presentations involving viral infections causing fulminant myocarditis alongside multi-organ involvement necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for effective management.",explain
"This is a clinical case of a child who presented with failure to thrive (FTT) along with acyanotic heart disease and right bronchopneumonia. Further assessment revealed a diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). It was determined that the child would need surgery to close the VSD and ligate the PDA.  Prior to surgery, various investigations were done to evaluate the child's overall health. These included a full blood count (FBC), serum electrolyte levels, urea, and creatinine – all of which were found to be within normal ranges. The patient was assigned an American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade 2, indicating mild systemic disease.  On the day of surgery, specific preparations were made regarding fasting and medication administration. The child was fasted from 12 midnight for solid foods but allowed breast feeding until 3:00 am prior to surgery. A peripheral line was secured in the morning using a 24G needle for easy access during anesthesia.  In the operating theatre, standard monitoring equipment such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximeter were attached to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation levels respectively. The patient was gently sedated using ketamine and midazolam while manual ventilation with 100% oxygen support was initiated.  To facilitate intubation – insertion of a tube into the trachea - vecuronium was administered after inducing anesthesia with ketamine. Mechanical ventilation started at low tidal volume with an adjusted respiratory rate according to medical guidelines. Analgesia in the form of intermittent fentanyl was given as required during surgery while isoflurane maintained anesthesia.  During surgery for VSD repair and PDA ligation, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) – a technique that temporarily takes over cardiac function -was employed for about 55 minutes. The surgeon used an aortic cross clamp for a total of 55 minutes to stop blood flow temporarily. Following successful weaning off CPB, it was noted that the radial artery blood pressure waveform appeared dampened, indicating some abnormality.  Further investigation revealed an interrupted aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery, where the PDA was supplying both upper and lower limbs. This unexpected finding required immediate reattachment of the subclavian artery to both ascending and descending segments of the aorta. To carry out this repair, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) was performed gradually by cooling down the patient's body temperature.  Once DHCA at 16°C was achieved, sustained for about 33 minutes while surgery took place. Gradual rewarming back to normal body temperature occurred over approximately 22 minutes after completion of repairs. Heparin reversal using protamine sulfate took place at this stage as well.  Throughout surgery, various medications were administered including adrenaline infusion for hemodynamic support after coming off CPB, milrinone infusion for improved cardiac contractility, and sildenafil for vasodilation.  After chest closure and stabilization in ICU post-surgery, management continued with supportive care including fluid management using furosemide to maintain urine output and medication such as paracetamol (analgesia), pantoprazole (gastric protection), methylprednisolone (anti-inflammatory), meropenem (antibiotic treatment), albumin (due to low levels), levosimendan infusion (for further cardiac support).  The child continued on mechanical ventilation overnight until extubation could be performed on day 3 post-operation when stable respiratory status allowed it. Oral rehydration salt solutions were started along with oral sildenafil and aldactone administration.  Over time in ICU recovery period ongoing treatment included dexmedetomidine – sedative pain relief – eventually leading towards discontinuation of infusion after the fifth hour in ICU. The child progressed well, with the crucial hemodynamic parameters remaining stable.  On Day 4 post-op, echocardiography results demonstrated satisfactory cardiac performance following surgery. Oral feeds commenced on Day 5 along with adjustments to medication regimens.  The child was eventually discharged home on day 11 in good condition and scheduled for a follow-up appointment four weeks post-surgery.  Throughout this case, a multidisciplinary team including anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and intensive care specialists played essential roles in ensuring patient safety and successful surgical outcomes.",explain
"Title: Abscess Formation due to Migration of a Gallstone: A Challenging Clinical Case  Introduction: Gallstones are a common affliction that can often be managed through non-invasive methods or surgical interventions. However, complications arising from gallstones migration can sometimes lead to complex and challenging clinical cases. In this case study, we explore the journey of a patient who experienced an array of symptoms before being diagnosed with an abscess caused by the migration of a gallstone. The patient's management and eventual recovery will also be discussed.  Case Presentation: The patient initially underwent surgery for an unrelated condition, which was followed by discharge without any postoperative complications. However, one month later, the patient reported new onset abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant that progressively worsened over time. On examination in the emergency room, he exhibited signs such as sweating and tenderness during palpation of the right hypochondrium.  Investigations: Considering his recent surgical history, laboratory tests were conducted which revealed leukocytosis without neutrophilia along with elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed thickening at transverse and internal oblique muscles in the right hypochondrium region, associated with surrounding fat densification and hyper-attenuation.  To further clarify these findings, an ultrasound examination was performed revealing pericentrimetric calcification about 6 cm deep from the skin surface along with adjacent pseudonodular densification suggestive of migrated stone and small surrounding collection.  Management: The patient was discharged with antibiotics therapy (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) for bacterial infection control. Symptoms improved initially; however intermittent pain persisted during regular follow-up visits.  Subsequently, elective removal of gallstone was proposed but before undergoing surgery again; he returned to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain associated with fever and right upper abdominal swelling. Abdominal examination revealed a hard, painful mass with signs of inflammation in the right hypochondrium.  Further investigations: Laboratory work demonstrated leukocytosis without neutrophilia. Ultrasound and CT scan revealed a hypoechoic structure suggesting an abscess or phlegm with possible liquefaction within the abdominal wall. In addition, prominent anterior parietal thickening with deep calcifications was observed, presumably representing chondral alteration and perhaps another gallstone.  Diagnosis and Treatment: Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with an abscess of the abdominal wall caused by a migrated gallstone. A course of antibiotics therapy was initiated for one week followed by surgery under general anesthesia to extract the gallstone and foreign body granuloma occupying the entire abdominal wall.  During surgery, no evidence of abscess formation was found in the abdominal wall; instead, a foreign body granuloma containing a pigmented gallstone in pre-peritoneal position provided confirmation. The extracted materials were sent for histopathological examination to confirm their nature.  Post-operative period and Follow-up: The patient's recovery following surgery was uneventful, accompanied by progressive improvement in symptoms. Regular follow-up visits were conducted over a year-long monitoring period, during which he remained asymptomatic without any further manifestations related to lost gallstones.  Conclusion: This complex clinical case highlights challenges associated with complications arising from migrated gallstones. Early recognition through advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT scan plays a vital role in accurate diagnosis leading to appropriate management strategies including antibiotic therapy if necessary followed by surgical intervention when indicated. Understanding such cases enhances our ability to provide optimal care for patients facing similar conditions while mitigating potential long-term complications associated with retained foreign bodies or calculi.",explain
"Clinical Case: Tuberculosis of the Parotid Gland  In this clinical case, we have encountered two patients with primary tuberculosis affecting the parotid glands. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs but can also involve other organs, including the lymph nodes, bones, and glands.  The first patient was a middle-aged woman who presented with suspicious lesions seen on a parotid MRI. The lesions were located between the superficial and deep lobes of the right parotid gland and showed characteristics indicative of malignancy. Additionally, multiple jugulodigastric adenopathies were found on imaging.  To obtain histological evidence for diagnosis, a partial exofacial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. The examination of resected tissue revealed primary tuberculosis affecting both the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes. This diagnosis was confirmed through definitive histological examination.  Upon confirmation of tuberculosis involvement, anti-bacillary treatment consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (2RHZ/4RH) was initiated for six months. Subsequently, significant improvement in clinical symptoms was observed even six months after completing treatment.  In contrast to our first patient's case involving right-sided lesions straddling between superficial and deep lobes alongwith adenopathies; our second patient presented as a young woman without any notable medical history or weight loss but complained about pain, fever at 38°C (100.4°F), slight redness near left sub-angulo-mandibular mass that lasted for four months.  Upon physical examination by an ENT specialist there were no signs of trismus or facial paralysis although slight inflammation around salivary orifices persisted without any pus discharge from them.The oral cavity examination did not reveal any inflammation or pus output either.Tumefaction in the left parotid area was firm, painless, and measured about 4 cm in its long axis. Moreover, there was no limitation in mouth opening or facial paralysis.  Further investigations were conducted to confirm the presence of an abscess within the left parotid gland. Cervical ultrasound revealed a tumor lesion with mixed echostructure and a central liquid predominance at the lower pole of the left parotid gland. A subsequent MRI showed a lesional process predominantly within the deep compartment of the left parotid gland.  Similar to our first patient where tuberculosis was confirmed by histopathological findings; this time also caseous necrosis (soft cheesy tissue) alongwith epithelial-gigantocellular granuloma formation within the cyst wall established primary tuberculosis as its cause which was also confirmed through acid-fast bacilli culture on Lowenstein-Jensen medium.  The young woman received medical treatment for her primary tuberculosis that consisted of an initial phase lasting two months with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by a consolidation phase lasting four months involving rifampicin and isoniazid only.  Fortunately, both patients experienced favorable outcomes following their respective treatments. The first patient had significant improvement within six months after completion of treatment while complete resolution took about nine months for our second patient after cessation of medical therapy.  In conclusion, these cases emphasize that tuberculosis can affect any organ or gland including locations such as the parotid glands. It highlights how clinical suspicion plays a crucial role in diagnosing rare presentations like tuberculosis involvement in salivary glands where other conditions like neoplastic lesions are more common. Early recognition through appropriate investigations such as imaging studies (MRI) along with histopathological examination helps initiate timely treatment resulting in favorable outcomes for patients affected by primary tubercular involvement even at uncommon sites like parotids",explain
"Case Summary:  This clinical case involves a 13-month-old child who experienced an episode of fever, followed by convulsions. The child was referred to a tertiary care center and admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for 15 days with a high-grade fever and refractory status epilepticus. Despite becoming afebrile after three days of admission, the seizures continued until day six. At discharge, the child had a frequency of 10 seizure episodes per day and displayed neuroregression in all developmental domains.  The child exhibited several concerning symptoms upon evaluation. He was unable to hold his neck or roll, had difficulty speaking, and did not respond to visual stimuli. He also showed generalized hypotonia, preferred W-sitting (a seated posture that can lead to muscle imbalances), had tightness in his bilateral hamstrings and calf muscles, engaged in body rocking behavior, chewed on his clothes, lacked eye contact or visual fixation/tracking abilities, and displayed equivocal light perception.  Diagnostic assessments were challenging due to the visual and cognitive impairments observed in the child. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to evaluate gross motor function classification level IV (indicating severe limitations). The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) score was determined as 5 out of possible 56 points.  Physiotherapy intervention played a crucial role in this case. The initial phase involved sustained stretching of both calf and hamstring muscles using functional positions while utilizing unstable surfaces like equilibrium boards and swiss balls for sitting balance challenges. Additionally:  1. A swing system provided vestibular input. 2. Visual stimuli were used to elicit responses. 3 Transitions like supine-to-sit and sit-to-stand were facilitated. 4 Proprioceptive stimulus provided through bouncing on a trampoline with support. 5 Weight-bearing exercises were included. 6 Joint compressions aided proprioception stimulation. 7 The use of a chewy tube addressed sensory needs.  Gradually, the child regained the ability to sit and stand without support and started using a walker (rollator) as a walking aid. The parents were educated about the home exercise program, which they implemented under professional guidance during follow-up visits over two years.  On reassessment, it was observed that the child had made progress. He could walk unsupported on uneven surfaces under supervision and demonstrated improved visual responsiveness. Additionally, behavioral improvements such as decreased body rocking and chewing on clothes were noted. The child showcased increased participation in social gatherings due to enhanced functional abilities.  Ultimately, this case demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach involving physiotherapy can positively influence the outcomes of patients with complex neurological disorders. A comprehensive treatment plan tailored to each patient's specific needs can lead to significant improvements in motor function, balance control, and overall quality of life.  The continued physiotherapy intervention played a pivotal role in maximizing the child's functional abilities. In the second phase of regular physiotherapy, which lasted for six months under the supervision of a physiotherapist, the primary goal was to achieve unsupported walking while considering the child's visual impairment.  During this phase, various sessions were conducted to challenge and enhance the child's balance and walking abilities. The therapist incorporated activities that required standing on equilibrium boards and stability discs with minimal support. The child also practiced walking on compliant surfaces, ramps, uneven terrains, and across obstacle courses. Negotiating stairs with moderate assistance while holding onto the railing became part of their routine.  To promote further sensory integration and coordination, proprioceptive (sensations from joints, muscles, and tendons), vestibular (balance-related sensations), and visual inputs were strategically incorporated into each session. These inputs aimed to enhance body awareness, spatial orientation, and overall motor planning skills in order to overcome challenges associated with visual impairment.  Following completion of this intensive course of physiotherapy intervention focusing on gait training and balance control enhancement techniques specific to visual impairments over different terrains/settings/environments/stressors/obstacles; it was observed that remarkable progress had been made by the child.  The child was now able to sit without support and stand independently. He demonstrated improved control during ambulation tasks on uneven surfaces as he successfully negotiated through them with standby supervision only when necessary for safety purposes. Moreover, there were positive improvements observed in his vision as indicated by his responsiveness towards light stimuli while seemingly avoiding collisions or bumping into objects or persons around him more effectively than before.  Psychosocially speaking; these improvements in functional activities greatly increased his participation in social gatherings as he became more mobile independent allowing him to engage freely with peers without constraints relating specifically due solely based upon functional limitations alone.  Further assessments conducted at ages 5 years old completed for adjusted GMFCS Level IV classification and 8 years old showcased the functional abilities and milestones achieved at significantly later time points. These assessments provide valuable evidence of the long-term benefits and impact of early physiotherapy intervention on the child's overall development.  This clinical case highlights the importance of early intervention, multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized treatment plans when dealing with complex neurological disorders. Physiotherapy techniques incorporating principles such as neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) and sensory integration (SI) have shown promising results in improving motor function, balance control, adaptive behavior, independence in mobility tasks for children with neuroregression post fever-related seizure episodes leading to significant regression across multiple developmental domains.  Beyond motor improvements alone; these interventions also contribute positively towards psychosocial development by improving functional independence that directly translates into improved participation within social environments.  However, it is essential to note that each case is unique, requiring a tailored approach based on an individual patient's specific needs. Close monitoring and ongoing reassessment are crucial to modify treatment plans as necessary in order to achieve optimal outcomes.  In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates how a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention utilizing various therapeutic approaches can positively influence the functional outcomes for children experiencing neurological regression following fever-related seizure episodes. Continued supportive care along with ongoing evaluation ensures that patients like this young child have access to comprehensive management strategies contributing towards their holistic well-being throughout different stages of their life span whilst living alongside complexity through both physical impairments as well as cognitive aspects impairment too –— thus promoting improved quality of lives not only for themselves but also those within their familial support networks/community around them far beyond hospital walls or clinic doors alone providing potentially life-changing chances that helps emancipate individuals from disability restrictions often seen upon them due solely based predominantly due solely simply because they were affected by medical conditions entirely out their realms control placed upon since birth albeit temporary or lingering causations stemming from febrile states dressed atop neural sequelae complications.",explain
"Clinical Case: Congenital Defects and Renal Failure in a Neonate  This clinical case describes the evaluation and management of a neonate presenting with multiple congenital abnormalities, including aplasia of the left antero-lateral abdominal muscles, undescended testes, hydro ureteronephrosis, and renal failure.  The delivery was uneventful with normal adaptation to extra-uterine life indicated by reassuring Apgar scores. However, meconium and urine were not emitted immediately after birth. On physical examination, the baby's overall appearance was normal, but several abnormalities were identified.  Firstly, there was asymmetrical distension of the abdomen with crumpling of the abdominal wall particularly on the left flank. Palpation revealed the presence of intestines beneath the skin. The umbilical stump appeared fresh and normally vascularized.  Further assessments showed that external genitalia were masculine but revealed an absence of descended testes in the scrotum. No other sexual differentiation anomaly was noted, and there was a present and permeable anus.  A notable finding from paraclinical exams was an abdominal ultrasound that revealed aplasia of left antero-lateral abdominal muscles. The kidney topography appeared normal with well-differentiated sizes; however, dilatation of ureters and pyelocaliectasis consistent with hydro ureteronephrosis were observed.  Kidney function tests demonstrated altered results with increased blood urea (2.19 g/l), elevated creatinine (33.0 mg/l), and significantly reduced creatinine clearance (5.88 ml/min). Furthermore, delayed micturition occurred 50 hours after birth.  Due to financial limitations, further complementary exams such as cardiac ultrasound and computed tomography scans could not be performed to explore for any additional malformations or complications related to other organ systems.  Despite efforts focused on managing fluid balance through electrolyte correction and maintaining appropriate body positioning, the neonate faced difficulties in breastfeeding and delayed digestion. Consequently, enteral feeding via nasogastric tube was initiated.  Surgical interventions to correct the observed abnormalities were planned but were hindered by renal failure and limited financial resources. The anticipated surgeries included orchidopexy for descended testes, urinary tract reconstruction to address the hydro ureteronephrosis, and abdominoplasty for abdominal muscle aplasia.  Unfortunately, before any surgical intervention could be performed or further investigations carried out due to financial limitations, the neonate succumbed after seven days of life.  This case presents a complex scenario with multiple congenital anomalies involving various organ systems. The presence of aplasia of abdominal muscles highlights an important musculoskeletal abnormality often associated with other genetic syndromes. Additionally, undescended testes are a common anatomical malformation that necessitates surgical correction (orchidopexy).  The most significant concern in this case is renal involvement manifested as hydro ureteronephrosis leading to renal failure. Renal impairment and delayed micturition were evident from abnormal kidney function tests (raised blood urea and creatinine levels) along with reduced creatinine clearance.  The contributing factors responsible for these complications require further investigation; however, limited resources prevented comprehensive diagnostic testing such as trans-fontanellar doppler ultrasounds or imaging studies like CT scans to identify potential associated anomalies or confirmations of diagnoses.  In summary, this clinical case emphasizes the challenges encountered in managing complex congenital defects when resources are limited. Despite efforts to optimize care through maintaining fluid balance and enteral nutrition provision using a nasogastric tube feeding route, complete resolution requires interventions such as orchidopexy for undescended testes and reconstructive surgery addressing musculoskeletal abnormalities' implications on gastrointestinal function.  However, financial constraints significantly impacted treatment options leading to an unfortunate outcome for this neonate affected by multiple congenital anomalies and renal failure. Such cases signify the importance of timely and comprehensive diagnostic evaluations along with adequate facilities to provide optimal care for infants with complex medical problems.",explain
"Clinical Case: Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma   This clinical case involves a patient who presented with exaggerated reflexes in the lower limbs. Local examination of the spine revealed tenderness in the right paravertebral area at the T12-L1 level, associated with a subcutaneous fixed mass. Imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine were performed.  The findings from these imaging studies showed multiple metastases that involved various parts of the spine. Specifically, there was involvement of the posterior part of the vertebral body at T5, with rupture of the posterior wall; The posterior elements of T12 and L1 vertebrae were affected, with a tissue mass causing bone lysis and severe compression on the spinal cord, extending into the paravertebral region; Additionally, there was involvement of S1 vertebral body with lysis, invasion into the right spinal canal and extension to pre-vertebral area.  On MRI scans, these lesions appeared iso-to hypo-intense to bone on T1 weighted images and heterogeneous on T2 weighted images with multiple hyperintense foci. Contrast enhancement was intense and heterogeneous as well. The CT scan confirmed bone lysis in these affected areas.  Further investigations including CT scans of brain, cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic regions were conducted along with systemic investigations looking for any primary tumoral lesion but all turned out negative. This suggested that these findings were most likely due to metastases rather than originating from a primary tumor site elsewhere in her body.  Given severe symptoms mainly related to compression at T12-L1 level while no other apparent distant metastasis found outside skeletal sites or CNS involvement like brain or spinal cord lesions responsible for exaggerated reflexes thus requiring immediate surgical intervention before pose major threat , it was decided to proceed with surgical intervention aimed at decompression at this level alongwith instrumented fixation using screws.In addition, due to history of lumbosacral radiculopathy , similar procedure was also performed at S1 level for which sacral decompression achieved using hemilaminectomy, curettage of the sacral body and radicular decompression. During surgery, it was observed that the tumor had invaded into the paravertebral muscles and appeared as a multi-lobulated firm mass with a white-reddish appearance. The tumor was not encapsulated but easily differentiated from the surrounding tissues. The bone lysis was evident and compression on the spinal cord was severe, however, dura matter infiltration was absent.  Postoperatively, the patient showed improvement in motor score and regained control over urinary function. She received rehabilitation therapy alongside adjuvant therapy under oncology unit careening hope that these interventions would help control further progression of her metastatic disease.  Unfortunately, one month after discharge, the patient presented with persistent headaches. Local examination revealed tenderness in the right frontal area of the skull convexity. A CT scan was performed and it showed a small lytic lesion in the frontal bone extending into the subcutaneous tissue, without dural extension.  A small craniectomy around the lesion was performed and histopathological analysis confirmed that it was consistent with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, similar to the previous findings in her spine. This finding indicated that her cancer had spread to her skull.  At one year follow-up, despite receiving adjuvant therapy, it became evident that it failed to control or halt tumor progression. Both local and systemic progression were observed on thoracic and abdominopelvic CT scans.  While there was continuous improvement in motor function leading to regained self-dependency, unfortunately, her general condition continued to deteriorate due to advancing cancer. At this point, palliative treatment options were assessed for providing relief from symptoms associated with advanced metastatic disease.  Despite medical intervention efforts aimed at controlling the disease progression and managing symptoms as best as possible for quality of life preservation ,unfortunately ,the patient succumbed to her illness two years after her initial management.  The final histopathology report confirmed a grade 3 leiomyosarcoma of FNCLCC (French Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) classification system which indicates aggressive malignant behavior of this sarcoma subtype based upon characteristics such as mitotic activity,tumor necrosis,presence/absence of elevated nuclear atypia .  Immunohistochemical staining yielded important results indicating cellular origin.Outcomes revealed positive staining for smooth muscle actin,a marker characteristic for smooth muscle cell lineage . Flawless reactivity against EMA (Epithelial Membrane Antigen )further pointed towards potential epithelial like phenotype however absence of S100 protein CD34 staining ruled out neurogenic and vascular origins respectively.  This case demonstrates the aggressive nature of metastatic leiomyosarcoma. The initial presentation with exaggerated reflexes and subsequent imaging findings revealed extensive metastatic involvement in the spine.  Surgical intervention provided temporary relief in terms of improved motor function and control over urinary capacity, but unfortunately, the disease continued to progress both locally in the spine and systemically. Metastasis to the skull further complicated her condition.  Despite efforts to manage symptoms through adjuvant therapy, tumor control was not achievable, resulting in a decline in her overall health status. Ultimately, palliative treatment was offered to improve quality of life as best as possible for remaining time.  This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis, comprehensive staging investigations , early surgical intervention , complete histopathological evaluation considering immunohistochemical panel availability allowing for determination of cellular lineage confirming tissue origin thus aiding accurate grading helping predict prognosis.Ongoing research endeavors are aimed at finding more effective treatment options for advanced leiomyosarcoma cases to improve overall outcomes and survival rates.",explain
"This clinical case presents a complex set of findings in a patient, ultimately diagnosed with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS) with sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) and an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter. The patient underwent surgical excision of the SCT, revealing no malignant foci on histopathology. However, difficulties were encountered during anesthesia induction due to bilateral congenital temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis.  The initial assessment of the patient included various observations and examinations. The pulse rate was noted to be 118 per minute, which was regular and of normal volume. Auscultation revealed heart sounds 1 and 2 without any murmurs. Clear lung fields with good air entry bilaterally indicated normal respiratory function.  Further examination revealed distinctive features on the patient's face. A coarse facial appearance with a flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), low-set microtic ears with protruding ear lobules, and a short upturned nose were noted. Additionally, an inter-incisal distance of approximately 13mm at maximal mouth opening suggested limited jaw mobility.  A swelling measuring about 15cm by 25cm in the lower sacral region was observed on physical examination. This sessile swelling had an irregular surface, soft consistency, and no distinct edges. Importantly, there was no bony defect underlying the swelling or pelvic extension noted upon digital rectal examination.  To further investigate these findings, two diagnostic tests were performed – a transthoracic echocardiography and an abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography. Echocardiography revealed situs solitus (normal arrangement) of atria and viscera along with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance – indicating proper alignment between chambers and great vessels of the heart.  The mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, and aortic valve were found to be normal on echocardiography. Chamber walls demonstrated good contractility without any atrial or ventricular septal defects seen. However, a thick band of echogenic tissue was detected in the right atrium that separated it into two unequal halves with an eccentric aperture communicating both chambers. This finding represented an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter.  Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound revealed normal right and left kidneys, ruling out any significant pathology in these organs. The patient's serum alpha-fetoprotein level was also measured and found to be elevated at 31mcg/L (normal range: 0-5mcg/L). Although genetic analysis was not performed due to limited hospital facilities, the clinical features combined with investigation results led to a diagnosis of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma.  Given the documented risk of malignancy in embryonic tumors associated with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, it was decided to perform an early excision of the sacrococcygeal mass. However, challenges arose during anesthesia induction when attempts to pass an endotracheal tube failed due to limited mouth opening caused by bilateral TMJ ankylosis.  As a result, fiber optic laryngeal intubation could not be carried out since this facility was not available in the hospital either. Consequently, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted for maintaining airway access during surgery while gastric decompression was achieved via naso-gastric intubation.  The excision procedure for the sacrococcygeal teratoma proceeded with the patient positioned on their left side instead of using the conventional prone jack-knife position due to limitations imposed by TMJ ankylosis.  Following surgery, the patient experienced uneventful post-operative recovery and was discharged on the tenth day for follow-up care at the outpatient clinic. The histopathology report of the excised tumor indicated a solid mass lined externally by unremarkable epidermis.  Within three weeks of the operation, during their first follow-up visit, the patient was referred to the Maxillofacial surgery unit due to their TMJ ankylosis. Unfortunately, they were subsequently lost to follow up, making it challenging to assess further management or treatment outcomes.  In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a rare condition involving Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma and asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter. Additionally, complications during anesthesia induction due to bilateral TMJ ankylosis added further complexity to patient management. The successful surgical excision of the teratoma emphasized prompt intervention given the known risk of malignancy associated with embryonic tumors in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome patients.",explain
"Title: A Complex Clinical Case: Diagnosis and Treatment of Neonatal Jaundice  Introduction: This case report outlines the clinical course, diagnosis, and treatment of a neonate presenting with significant hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, fever, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and abnormal liver function. The initial suspicion was for biliary atresia due to worsening symptoms over time; however, the ultimate diagnosis turned out to be a congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.  Case Summary: A newborn baby presented with jaundice on the third day of life followed by fever on the fourth day. Initial laboratory investigations revealed unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with an increasing proportion of conjugated bilirubin within 6 days. Additionally, thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count) led to blood transfusion due to low hematocrit levels.  Further diagnostic tests were performed including a hepatobiliary scan ruling out obvious abnormalities and screening for various infections such as hepatitis B/C and syphilis. As feed tolerance improved initially but weight loss continued despite treatment measures, heightened suspicion for biliary atresia arose.  A repeat ultrasound showed a contracted gallbladder with thickened walls further suggesting possible cholecystitis related to biliary atresia. However, this notion was later disproven by another scan.  With limited diagnostic options remaining in play without indication from specific findings or results from alpha-1 antitrypsin assay screening due to practical constraints - CMV infection became strongly suspected leading to subsequent CMV screening which confirmed high IgM titers indicating recent infection in both mother and baby.  Treatment Approach: Intravenous Ganciclovir was initiated promptly following confirmation of congenital CMV infection in the neonate which underwent therapy for three weeks before transitioning into oral Valganciclovir for an additional three weeks. Throughout the course of intravenous therapy, frequent phlebitis incidences occurred due to Ganciclovir administration requiring repeated cannulation.  Monitoring: Weekly full blood count tests were performed during treatment which revealed a decline in neutrophil count, although never dropping to levels classifying as neutropenia. Importantly, liver function parameters consistently improved and eventually normalized by 12 months of age.  Clinical Outcome: Fortunately, the child experienced no apparent neurological abnormalities during or after treatment and achieved normal developmental milestones within normal limits up until the last follow-up at 15 months of age. Normal hearing and visual tests further supported healthy development.  Conclusion: This complex clinical case initially raised suspicion for biliary atresia due to progressive symptoms but ultimately resulted in a diagnosis of congenital CMV infection necessitating prompt antiviral therapy. The diligent management and successful outcome underscored the importance of thorough differential diagnosis, extensive testing for viral infections when faced with diagnostic uncertainties, and early initiation of appropriate treatment protocols. Communication between healthcare professionals, including nurses experienced in science communication like myself, plays a vital role in conveying accurate information regarding diagnosis, monitoring, management strategies to caregivers while addressing their concerns throughout such challenging cases.  Word Count: 600 words Continuation:  Understanding the clinical course in this case is crucial for comprehending the complexity of the diagnostic process and subsequent treatment strategies.  The presence of neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes initially raised concerns about liver dysfunction. However, the normal clotting profile and serum protein levels helped rule out severe liver impairment or decompensation.  To exclude common causes of neonatal jaundice such as viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B and C), syphilis, and HIV, specific serological tests were performed but all came back negative. This further complicated the diagnosis as no clear etiology was identified based on initial screening.  The progressive increase in conjugated bilirubin levels over time highlighted worsening hepatobiliary dysfunction. Additionally, thrombocytopenia indicated impaired platelet production or function in response to liver dysfunction.  As feed tolerance improved but weight loss persisted despite nutritional support measures, concerns grew regarding biliary atresia - a congenital condition characterized by blocked bile ducts leading to impaired bile flow from the liver into the intestines. However, repeated ultrasound evaluations failed to demonstrate characteristic findings associated with biliary atresia.  Given these diagnostic challenges alongside persistent abnormal liver function parameters such as elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels beyond reference values and a peak value that reached 3,090 IU/L - considerations for alternative diagnoses gained prominence.  Further investigations led to screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection due to its potential association with prolonged neonatal cholestasis. The serological tests revealed strong positive IgM titers for CMV infection not only in the baby but also in their mother. This confirmed recent maternal-fetal transmission of CMV during pregnancy leading to congenital infection.  Prompt initiation of intravenous Ganciclovir followed by oral Valganciclovir successfully managed CMV infection in this case. Frequent intravenous cannulation and phlebitis episodes were significant challenges encountered during the administration of Ganciclovir. However, diligent monitoring including weekly full blood count tests ensured appropriate management of potential side effects, including a decline in neutrophil count.  During and after antiviral therapy, liver function parameters showed consistent improvement until they eventually returned to normal by 12 months of age. Remarkably, the child did not demonstrate any visible neurological abnormalities throughout the treatment period and achieved developmental milestones within expected limits.  Follow-up evaluations included hearing and visual tests which indicated no impairments related to CMV infection or its treatment.  This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainties that can arise in complex clinical presentations such as neonatal jaundice with progressive liver dysfunction. It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive screening for various potential causes and considering less common etiologies when initial investigations prove inconclusive.  Moreover, effective communication among healthcare providers is crucial for sharing knowledge, discussing differential diagnoses, collaborating on treatment strategies, providing ongoing support to caregivers, and ensuring a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient care outcomes.  By actively engaging in science communication as nurses experienced in clinical cases like this one, we lay essential groundwork for facilitating better understanding among patients' families while empowering them with accurate information about their child's condition and potential treatment options available.

"Title: Successful Management of a COVID-19 Positive Pregnant Patient: A Clinical Case Study  Introduction: This clinical case study highlights the successful management of a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 infection who presented with abdominal pain and uterine contractions. The case discusses the multidisciplinary approach taken for her care, including preoperative preparation, surgical intervention, postoperative care, and follow-up. The effective implementation of infection prevention and control measures ensured the safety of both the mother and her neonate.  Case Presentation: The patient presented with abdominal pain and uterine contractions suggestive of preterm labor. Upon examination, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after 48 hours. She was referred to a dedicated hospital ward equipped to manage patients with COVID-19 but lacked specific facilities for infected pregnant women.  Management Strategy: To ensure optimal care while minimizing risks associated with transmission, the woman was admitted to a private room at an isolation ward prior to undergoing a caesarean section. Multidisciplinary team members consisting of obstetricians, anaesthetists, neonatologists, nurses, psychiatrists, and infectious disease experts were assembled to provide comprehensive care considering all aspects of the patient's health.  Preoperative Preparation: Given the need for surgery due to worsening symptoms and potential risks from prolonging pregnancy during active COVID-19 infection, various preoperative measures were implemented in line with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. These included staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), simulation sessions to practice proper IPC protocols before performing surgery on a COVID-positive patient.  Surgical Intervention: After obtaining remote consent via video call using WhatsApp messaging as an effective communication tool, transport to the operating theatre adhered strictly to IPC precautions. Lower segment caesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia along with bilateral tubal ligation. Throughout surgery monitoring parameters remained stable maintaining oxygen saturation above 98%. Prophylactic medications such as tranexamic acid and carbetocin were administered during the procedure.  Postoperative Care: The mother and newborn were nursed in the recovery room of the operating theatre immediately after delivery. The vital signs of both individuals remained stable during this period, and there were no postoperative complications. The newborn was initially fed with breast milk substitute until breastfeeding could be established.  Follow-up and Discharge: After 48 hours, nasopharyngeal swabs from the neonate tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Both mother and baby remained asymptomatic throughout the postpartum period. The criteria for discharge for the mother included being asymptomatic for more than 14 days from her initial positive COVID-19 test result. Telephonic conversations played a crucial role in frequent communication between healthcare professionals involved in her care.  Conclusion: This clinical case demonstrates successful multidisciplinary management of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection who required surgical intervention due to obstetric indications. Through adhering to proper IPC guidelines, appropriate preoperative preparation, implementing necessary precautions during surgery, delivering optimal postoperative care, effective follow-up measures, safe discharge criteria were achieved while ensuring minimal contact between staff and patient.  The successful outcome emphasizes the importance of coordination among healthcare professionals involved in such cases while ensuring patients receive safe delivery practices even amidst a pandemic situation.

"This clinical case depicts a young woman with a significant family history of colon cancer. Her mother and elder sister both passed away from the same illness, with her sister being diagnosed at a young age and her mother in middle age. The patient denies any smoking or alcohol consumption but mentions using firewood for cooking since childhood.  Initially, the patient sought medical treatment for Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) at various health facilities in Gulu. Despite receiving treatment with antacids and proton pump inhibitors, she only experienced mild relief from her symptoms. A mass was biopsied under ultrasound guidance but the histology results showed non-specific inflammation.  On physical examination, the patient appeared moderately wasted and pale but not jaundiced. She had moderate dehydration, tenderness in the right hypochondrial and lumbar regions of the abdomen, as well as an ill-defined palpable mass in those areas.  Further laboratory investigations revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia, indicating that she had low levels of red blood cells that were smaller than normal. However, liver function parameters and renal function parameters were within normal ranges.  Abdominal ultrasound revealed an ill-defined mass with central echogenicity in the right hypochondrial region measuring approximately 7.2cm wide. There were no signs of intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or ascites (abnormal accumulation of fluid).  Due to socio-economic reasons, a requested barium enema was not performed to further investigate the condition. The patient's frustrated family requested a transfer to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital for further management.  At Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, a senior surgeon reviewed the case noting both the nature of the mass and positive familial history of colon carcinoma. Considering these factors, an exploratory laparotomy (surgical exploration) was recommended since cost limitations prevented extensive investigations.  During surgery, it was found that there was a firm mobile mass extending from hepatic flexure to the ascending colon. A right hemicolectomy was performed, removing part of the colon and creating an end-to-side anastomosis (surgical connection) between the distal ileum and mid-third of the transverse colon.  Macroscopic examination of the resected tumor indicated a firm, nodular, necrotic mass at the hepatic flexure measuring 7.0cm in diameter. The tumor had not spread beyond the serosa (the outermost layer) of the colon. Histology revealed a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with clear margins around the resected area.  Postoperatively, the patient recovered well without complications and was discharged on day six after surgery. She was advised to continue attending follow-up appointments at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital as well as visit Uganda Cancer Institute for expert advice and treatment from an oncologist specializing in cancer care.  Three weeks later, a thorough evaluation showed that all physical and clinical parameters remained within their normal ranges. Notably, further review of Lacor Hospital's cancer registry indicated that all female patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin between 2013-2015 were older than 40 years old.  In conclusion, this clinical case presents a young woman with a family history suggestive of hereditary colorectal cancer who initially presented with symptoms resembling Peptic Ulcer Disease but was ultimately found to have well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of her colon. The successful surgical management resulted in favorable postoperative outcomes, but continued care under oncological expertise is advised moving forward for long-term management and monitoring due to her familial history and age at presentation being uncommon for sporadic cases.

"Clinical Case: Extramedullary Isolated CNS Blast Crisis in a Patient with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)  Introduction: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Although CML primarily affects the bone marrow, it can also manifest as extramedullary disease involving other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). In this clinical case, a pediatric patient with CML developed severe neurological symptoms associated with retinal edema and subsequent CNS blast crisis.  Initial Disease Management: The patient was initially diagnosed with CML and received a therapeutic regimen consisting of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea, and imatinib - a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL fusion protein responsible for driving CML. The treatment protocol resulted in complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. However, several months later, the patient presented to the emergency room with severe headache, vomiting, pain, and bilateral visual loss.  Initial Clinical Presentation: Upon examination during readmission to the pediatric department, the patient appeared pale but was afebrile. Her blood pressure was measured at 100/60 mm/Hg while her heart rate recorded 98 beats per minute. No lymphadenopathy was observed during physical examination their nervous system assessment yielded normal results except for an exophthalmia in both eyes. Pupillary reaction to light was sluggish; fundoscopy revealed bilateral stage III disc edema and retinal hemorrhages.  Diagnostic Workup: A brain computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to investigate possible leukemic involvement or intracranial events like cerebral edema; however no abnormalities were found. Subsequent tests included bone marrow aspiration which showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative.  Potential Side Effect of Imatinib: Considering the lack of alternative pathology to explain the retinal edema, medical professionals suspected imatinib as a potential cause and temporarily interrupted its administration. The patient was initiated on anti-edema therapy involving mannitol and dexamethasone. Despite these interventions, the patient later returned to the emergency room with recurring headaches, weakness in extremities, and seizures.  Progression and Diagnosis: Intensified neurological symptoms led to an assessment that revealed neck rigidity, meningeal signs, and lower limb paraplegia during nervous system examination. Brain CT identified chronic subdural hematoma with serpiginous gyriform enhancement around a contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of CSF collected showed lymphoblasts with a white blood cell count of 11,000 cells/mL. Flow cytometry confirmed lymphoid blast infiltration by demonstrating positivity for cluster differentiation markers (CD34, CD19, CD10) alongside partial positivity for CD45.  Extramedullary Isolated CNS Blast Crisis Treatment: Given this diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crisis (lymphoid type), treatment consisted of high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy along with intrathecal therapy employing methotrexate, arabinoside, and dexamethasone. Imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg per day due to disease progression in the CNS despite systemic therapy response.  Radiation Therapy and Prognosis: To target CNS lesions further, whole-brain radiation therapy delivering 24 Gy was administered while allogenic stem cell transplantation was deemed unfeasible due to limitations or contraindications determined by the clinical team. Adequate response to systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy resulted in rapid neurological improvements; however, the patient's visual loss did not exhibit any signs of recovery despite intervention.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights the development of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crisis in a pediatric CML patient. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were crucial to manage this aggressive manifestation involving the CNS. The use of dasatinib and intensified systemic chemotherapy, coupled with intrathecal therapy and radiation therapy, aimed to control disease progression. Despite neurological improvements, irreversible bilateral optic atrophy resulted in persistent visual loss for the patient.  It is important to note that each case may have variability based on several factors including individual response to treatment and other comorbidities. Medical professionals must evaluate patients individually and adapt treatment strategies accordingly.",explain
"This clinical case describes the journey of a patient with a complex cardiac condition who becomes pregnant.   The patient had previously undergone phlebotomy due to hyperviscosity, but despite being advised about the risks of pregnancy, she insisted on having a child. At the time of her first pregnancy at age 32, she experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester. However, one year later, she presented to our clinic once again, this time with a seven-week pregnancy.  At this point in the patient's history, she was not on any medication and had only mild effort intolerance (NYHA II). Her blood pressure and pulse rate were within normal limits. However, her oxygen saturations ranged between 86% and 89%, indicating lower than optimal levels. Further investigation through transthoracic echocardiography revealed that her heart anatomy was in line with what was observed during her childhood surgical procedure.  The echocardiogram showed usual veno-atrial and atrioventricular connections but revealed that there was a diminutive outlet portion of the right ventricle without continuity to an arterial segment. Both ventricles were connected to a solitary arterial trunk through sub-arterial VSD (ventricular septal defect). Additionally, large collateral vessels known as major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) were found originating from the descending aorta and appeared to be responsible for pulmonary blood flow.  Despite these findings and signs of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography, which necessitated emphasizing again the risks of pregnancy to both mother and fetus including termination as an option for management plan discussions – this time with input from various specialists -the patient insisted on continuing with the pregnancy.  With multidisciplinary collaboration among experts including cardiologists obstetrician/gynecologists, cardiac anesthetists), it was determined that close monitoring would be required throughout pregnancy along with considerations regarding deliver As the patient progressed in her pregnancy, her effort tolerance worsened and her oxygen saturation dropped to 80%. Her hemoglobin levels also rose to 19.9g/dl, indicating a higher than normal level of red blood cells. As a result, she was admitted to the hospital at 28 weeks gestation and placed on bed rest with close surveillance and regular fetal monitoring.  To address the risk of thromboembolism, the patient was prescribed elastic compression stockings and anticoagulated with warfarin, targeting an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3. This medication helps prevent blood clots from forming. Additionally, pelvic scans were performed throughout the pregnancy to monitor fetal development.  Unfortunately, subsequent scans showed signs of oligohydramnios, which indicates a decrease in amniotic fluid volume. Given this finding and concerns for both mother and fetus's well-being at this point in the pregnancy (34 weeks), it was decided that delivery was necessary.  An elective Caesarean section was performed at 34 weeks under general anesthesia. The infant delivered weighed only 1.2 kg but had APGAR scores of 6 at one minute after birth which increased to7 by five minutes post-birth indicating overall good condition.  On the second day following delivery, however,the mother developed congestive heart failure leading to symptoms such as fluid retention and shortness of breath.Based on these symptoms,she received diuretics(furosemideand spironolactone)for effective management . Fortunately,the response was positive,and she responded well to treatment.Following this treatment plan,she remained hospitalized for approximately one week before being discharged.  The newborn baby required initial care inthe neonatal intensive care unit but subsequent echocardiogram showed no evidence of congenital heart defects(CHD). Post-delivery evaluation indicated that the mother's ventricular function remained good on echocardiogram.  Approximately a year after delivery, a computed tomographic angiography was conducted to further evaluate the patient's pulmonary blood flow sources. The results showed that the ascending aorta measured 45mm and had a normal branching pattern.  Furthermore, it was observed that the right lung was supplied by an 18mm MAPCA from the descending aorta and the left lung was supplied by another MAPCA measuring 20mm with origin stenosis. These findings provided valuable information regarding the patient's condition following delivery.  Over time, following up six years post-delivery, both the mother and child have been reported as doing well. Although her effort tolerance has diminished moderately since becoming a mother, she is still able to care for her child and perform her daily tasks reasonably well.  This case highlights the complexity of managing pregnancy in patients with underlying cardiac conditions. It required close collaboration among various specialist teams to develop an appropriate management plan that considered both maternal and fetal well-being. Regular monitoring throughout pregnancy along with careful consideration of risks enabled successful outcomes for both mother and child in this case. ",explain
"This clinical case describes a rare condition called ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl. Basidiobolomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Basidiobolus ranarum.  The patient described in the case presented with several symptoms. She had poor general condition and functional impotence when walking. Upon examination, her palpebral and bulbar mucous membranes were pale and anicterical, respectively. She also had a fever of 40ºC and a steady tachycardia at 100 beats per minute.  The dermatological examination revealed large, indurated, erythematous, warm plaques that were mobile with respect to the deep plane but adhering to the superficial plane. The edges of the plaques were clearly delineatable by fingers and were present on her lower limbs, back, abdomen, pubis, and vulva. Within these plaques were hollow ulcers with polycyclic contours, fibrinous necrotic bottoms, detached edges, and no pigmentation in the peri-ulcer area.  Additional findings included lymphoedema on the back of her left foot and inflammatory inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally. The left knee was also blocked in flexion causing functional impotence to walk.  Further diagnostic investigations were conducted to confirm or rule out potential causes for this clinical presentation. Ziehl Nielsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium ulcerans by gene amplification of a specific genome sequence known as IS2404 (which is typically associated with Buruli ulcer). However direct examination of a punch biopsy sample showed yeasts and mycelial filaments suggestive of basidiobolomycosis.  Complementary examinations revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia along with leukocytosis predominated by eosinophils. The C-reactive protein level was elevated at 192mg/L. Serologies for HIV and hepatitis B infection were negative.  Histopathology findings showed well-differentiated epidermis with discreet orthokeratosis and a dermal site of significant inflammatory fibrosis. The inflammation within the dermis consisted of numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells associated with epithelioid granulomas and giganto-cellular granulomas centered by extracellular eosinophilic masses and bulky mycelial filaments, which is known as Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon - a characteristic finding in basidiobolomycosis.  Although mycological culture and PCR to identify the specific fungus were not done due to technical reasons, based on the clinical presentation, direct examination findings, and histopathology results, the diagnosis of ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl was made.  Treatment for this condition involved oral ketoconazole (100 mg per day) to target the fungal infection. Additionally, correction of anemia using oral iron suspension (5 mg per day) was initiated along with improved nutrition through enriched porridges and a high protein diet. Regular transaminase assays were performed to monitor liver function during treatment.  Surgical management was also carried out, which involved removing the ulcers initially and then performing a cutaneous mesh transplant to facilitate healing of large ulcers. Physiotherapists were involved in correcting the knee flexion anomaly, promoting extremity recovery and walking ability, as well as managing lymphoedema.  The patient's progress was favorable after 14 weeks of complete medical treatment including resolution of lymphoedema, flexum correction, ulcer healing without recurrence noted after 6 months or one year of follow-up.  In conclusion, this case highlights an uncommon fungal infection called basidiobolomycosis, which presented with characteristic dermatological findings, systemic symptoms, and associated complications like lymphoedema and knee flexion impairment. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment led to a favorable outcome for the patient.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke, specifically a partial Wallenberg (medullary) syndrome. The patient had palatal weakness, impaired gag and cough reflex, nasal quality in speech, but normal extra-ocular movements. However, a 1.5 tesla MRI of the brain with MR angiogram revealed no abnormalities.  Due to the patient being a hypertensive male and having an acute presentation of symptoms without diurnal variation in intensity or fatiguability, myasthenia gravis (MG) was not considered initially. Instead, the diagnosis was thought to be an ischemic stroke.  The patient was admitted and started on various medications including antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin, neurotropics, antihypertensives and statins. Nasogastric (NG) tube insertion was planned to prevent aspiration of food since the patient exhibited difficulty in articulation of speech and persistent nasal speech.  Routine blood investigations were conducted along with thrombophilia blood workup, a 2D echocardiogram, and 24-hour holter monitoring as part of young stroke workup; all results were normal. Throughout the hospital stay, the patient experienced elevated blood pressures on multiple occasions but they were controlled by optimizing antihypertensive medication.  Upon discharge after a week's stay in the hospital, signs of bulbar weakness persisted such as hyponasal voice and nasal regurgitation. Feedings continued via nasogastric tube to prevent further aspiration.  During subsequent follow-up consultations after one month from discharge date showed persistent palatal weakness and associated dysphagia. Further evaluations including fluoroscopic evaluation of deglutition revealed weakness in base tongue muscles hindering normal deglutition which resulted in determining that the NG tube should remain in place.  Continued worsening symptoms led to consideration for myasthenia gravis as a differential diagnosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test and estimation of acetyl choline receptor (AchR) antibody in serum were conducted, both of which confirmed a diagnosis of generalized MG. The AchR antibody levels were strongly positive. Treatment was initiated with pyridostigmine and oral prednisolone.  The patient showed significant improvement in bulbar weakness and fatiguability after two weeks on the treatment regimen. A CT scan of the thorax ruled out thymoma, a common finding in MG patients.  Therapy with neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and oral prednisolone was continued for two more months leading to further reduction in symptoms, eventually weaning the patient off the NG tube. By three months, he became symptom-free.  During a review in March 2020, his symptoms remained absent. Improvement was also observed in his previously furrowed/fissured and atrophied tongue upon continuing the same management approach.  This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses when initial findings do not align with expectations. In this instance, myasthenia gravis was not initially considered due to potential confusion with acute ischemic stroke symptoms. The appropriate investigations eventually led to an accurate diagnosis and successful treatment outcome for the patient.  1) Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985575/ This clinical case describes the course of treatment for a patient who initially presented with symptoms resembling an acute ischemic stroke but was eventually diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). After the diagnosis was confirmed through repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) testing and measurement of acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies, the patient's treatment regimen was adjusted accordingly.  The patient began receiving a low dose of pyridostigmine, a medication commonly used to improve muscle strength by enhancing neuromuscular transmission. Additionally, oral prednisolone, a corticosteroid with immunosuppressive properties, was prescribed to help manage inflammation associated with MG. Both medications are effective in managing symptoms and improving quality of life for MG patients.  Follow-up evaluations were conducted to monitor the progression of the disease and evaluate response to treatment. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax was performed to rule out thymoma, a tumor commonly associated with MG that can exacerbate symptoms. Fortunately, no thymoma was found in this case.  As treatment continued over two months, there was marked reduction in the patient's bulbar weakness and fatiguability. This improvement allowed for weaning off the nasogastric (NG) tube since swallowing function improved gradually over time.  During subsequent follow-up consultations after three months from initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment, the patient remained symptom-free. The previously observed furrowed/fissured appearance and atrophy in his tongue had also improved significantly under continued management.  It is worth noting that managing MG requires long-term care because it is a chronic autoimmune condition that may require adjustments in medication dosages or additional therapies based on individual needs. Close monitoring is necessary to maintain optimal symptom control while minimizing side effects from medications.  This case emphasizes several important points related to clinical practice:  1. Accurate Diagnosis: It illustrates how differentiating between various conditions that present with similar symptoms is crucial for providing appropriate treatment. The initial suspicion of an acute ischemic stroke was reconsidered when the patient's clinical course did not align with expectations, ultimately leading to the correct diagnosis of MG.  2. Multidisciplinary Approach: The management of complex cases like this one often requires input from various healthcare professionals, including neurologists, radiologists, and speech therapists, among others. Collaboration among these specialists allows for a comprehensive evaluation and optimal treatment plan.  3. Timely Evaluations: Due to the fluctuating nature of MG symptoms, it is important to conduct regular follow-up evaluations to monitor disease progression and therapy response. Adapting treatment strategies as needed ensures that patients receive appropriate care based on their individual needs.  In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses during differential diagnosis processes and emphasizes the need for thorough investigation when initial findings do not align with expectations. Effective communication between healthcare providers and multidisciplinary collaboration play a critical role in achieving accurate diagnoses and implementing appropriate treatments for complex conditions like myasthenia gravis.

"Patient Case: Finger Prosthesis for Rehabilitation  Introduction: In this clinical case, we discuss a patient who suffered multiple amputations of both hands. The patient expressed a desire to improve their quality of life by requesting finger prostheses. After careful consideration and consent from the patient, a plan was formulated to utilize silicone prostheses as the first stage of treatment. This involved taking measurements by a Certified Prosthetist and following various manufacturing steps to create the customized finger prosthesis.  Impression Taking: Taking impressions plays a crucial role in creating accurate and well-fitting prosthetics. In this case, due to the amputation of the distal phalanx of the second finger, obtaining an impression on that specific finger was challenging. Instead, an impression was taken on the contralateral finger (opposite side) to ensure proper fitting.  Using hydrophilic vinyl-polysiloxane impression material, two layers were wrapped around the fingers while they were in a relaxed position. After approximately 10 minutes, once the material had set, negative molds were removed from the fingers. This step provided essential information about their shape and size.  Creation of Wax Pattern and Final Mold: To replicate the hand's anatomy accurately before proceeding with silicone manufacturing, liquid wax was poured into each negative mold retrieved from earlier impressions. This process resulted in positive replicas that served as templates for subsequent steps.  A second impression was then taken from each wax mold to create final molds that would be used for incorporating silicone solution into them later on.  Suspension Cavity Creation: Ensuring proper suspension is vital when it comes to securing and stabilizing prosthetic devices onto patients' residual limbs effectively. In this case, a suspension cavity was specifically created within each final mold using cast-made pins—a technique detailed in previous studies referenced [9] [10]. These pins help maintain suspension by gripping onto surrounding tissues or structures inside each mold during prosthetic attachment.  Color-Matching and Aesthetics: To blend seamlessly with the patient's skin tone, artist's oil colors were mixed with the silicone solution. This color-matching process aims to create a lifelike appearance for the prostheses, further enhancing their natural-looking aspect.  Manufacturing Process and Heat Treatment: In an ideal setting, an electric oven would be used to heat the silicone solution inside each mold. However, due to unavailability, a kitchen gas stove was utilized as an alternative heating source. The completed molds were closed and placed on the stove for approximately one hour.  To ensure even temperature distribution throughout each cast mold, they were turned periodically on the gas stove surface. This step helped maintain uniformity in heat exposure among different areas of the molds.  Prosthesis Finalization: Following completion of heating treatment, the finished prostheses were carefully retrieved from their molds. Excess silicone flesh protruding at margins was trimmed off to achieve clean and well-finished edges.  Patient Fitting and Satisfaction: After receiving education regarding proper care for the prosthesis, including how to don and doff it correctly, the patient tried on their new finger prostheses. With good suspension achieved through earlier techniques outlined above in conjunction with a realistic skin color match obtained during manufacturing stages; these custom-made finger prostheses successfully met both functional and aesthetic requirements according to patient feedback.  The individual reported no pain while wearing them and demonstrated improved grip ability by successfully grasping objects—a significant positive outcome indicating successful rehabilitation following amputations. Overall satisfaction with both appearance and function was reported by this patient who can now enjoy an enhanced quality of life thanks to these custom finger prostheses.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights a successful rehabilitation approach through custom finger prosthesis manufacturing utilizing various techniques such as impression taking, wax pattern creation, suspension cavity formation within molds, color-matching steps using artist's oil colors, and the use of a gas stove for heat treatment. Through careful planning and collaboration between the prosthetist, patient, and healthcare team, a high-quality silicone finger prosthesis was created to meet the patient's individual needs, resulting in improved functionality, comfort, aesthetics, and overall satisfaction.",explain
"Clinical Case 1:  In this case, we have a pregnant patient who had a heart condition known as mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle in the heart. It can lead to decreased blood flow through the valve and increased pressure in the left atrium.  Initially, the patient was offered percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (PBV), which is a minimally invasive procedure to open up the narrowed valve using a balloon catheter. However, this procedure was not available, so an open commissurotomy was offered instead. Open commissurotomy involves surgically cutting through some of the fused leaflets of the mitral valve to improve blood flow.  The patient declined open commissurotomy due to concerns about risks associated with surgery during pregnancy. Instead, she was started on propranolol to treat her persistent tachycardia and on warfarin as prophylactic treatment for potential clot formation due to her heart condition.  During pregnancy, warfarin is generally not recommended due to potential risks to fetal development. Therefore, at 36 weeks gestation, she switched from warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH is an anticoagulant that does not cross the placenta easily and has less risk of causing birth defects compared to warfarin.  At 38 weeks gestation, an echocardiogram showed that her mitral valve area (MVA) had improved to 0.9cm2 and her ejection fraction (EF) was 58%. These measurements indicate that there was some improvement in blood flow through her mitral valve and her overall cardiac function.  Her functional status at this time was classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, meaning she had mild symptoms and could perform ordinary physical activities without limitations.  An estimated fetal weight (EFW) of 1950g was determined, and evaluations of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) flow showed no abnormalities. In preparation for a required lapse period between the last dose of LMWH and an epidural procedure, she underwent elective induction of labor.  However, six hours after initiating labor induction, the patient developed fetal bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate in the fetus. This is a concerning sign, indicating that the fetus may not be tolerating labor well. As a result, an emergency caesarean section was performed under general anesthesia instead of using an epidural catheter that had been intended for established labor.  A live baby weighing 2020g was delivered successfully. Frusemide (a diuretic) and antibiotics were given to the patient peri-partum to manage any fluid overload or potential infection.  The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 7 on warfarin therapy and remained stable when reviewed by both her physician and obstetrician 14 days postpartum. However, four weeks postpartum she experienced shortness of breath, severe supraventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles), hypotension (low blood pressure), leading to her unfortunate death three days later.  Clinical Case 2:  In this case, we have a pregnant patient known to have rheumatic heart disease with a mechanical mitral valve who was on warfarin therapy before her pregnancy. Rheumatic heart disease is caused by damage to the heart valves due to rheumatic fever – a complication of untreated streptococcal infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever.  Warfarin is commonly used as anticoagulant medication but can cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Despite this, the patient continued her pregnancy against advice from her gynecologist and cardiologist.  At 20 weeks gestation, a fetal anomaly scan revealed severe abnormalities in the development of the fetus' brain. The ventricles of the brain were found to be severely dilated, and there was a lack of identifiable cortical brain tissue.  The radiological investigation confirmed a condition called hydraencephaly, which involves replacement of supratentorial (above the cerebellum) brain parenchyma with cerebrospinal fluid. The posterior fossa structures were mildly preserved, but overall these findings were not compatible with extra-uterine life.  The couple was informed about these findings and opted for termination of pregnancy (TOP). The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) – a measure used to monitor warfarin therapy – at that time was within therapeutic range (2.3). She expelled the conceptus within 24 hours after induction without excessive bleeding or complications.  Following TOP, she was discharged in stable condition and offered a Copper T intrauterine contraceptive device (Cu-IUCD), which serves as an effective long-term contraceptive option to prevent future pregnancies.  It's crucial to note that both cases highlight potential risks associated with heart conditions during pregnancy. Each patient had different circumstances and management plans tailored specifically for their situation. These cases underscore the importance of close collaboration among physicians from different specialties to ensure optimal care for pregnant patients with complex medical conditions like heart disease.",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with unclear origins of symptoms. The initial evaluation through ultrasound did not reveal any free fluid in the abdomen, and the patient was otherwise stable with no fever or hemodynamic instability. Routine blood tests, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and pregnancy test were all normal. Despite these inconclusive findings, the patient was admitted to the ward for pain management.  The following day, an abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed to further investigate the cause of the patient's symptoms. The CT scan showed a sausage-like cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the hepatic flexure of the colon. As a result, there was displacement of the cecum which became ante-flexed over the ascending colon. However, there were no lesions identified in the liver or lymphadenopathy observed. The length of this mass measured 17.27 cm with a maximum diameter of 5.28 cm.  Based on careful analysis by both surgeon and radiologist reviewing this imaging technique, an initial impression was made that suggested an appendiceal mucocele as being responsible for these findings.  Given this diagnosis, it was decided that a semi-elective right hemi-colectomy would be performed to remove affected tissues and prevent potential complications from arising in future.  During surgery exploration revealed a massively distended appendix pushing onto redundant cecal end reaching up to hepatic flexure of colon while its tip extended into right iliac fossa area directly located below caeca ileocecal valve (Figure1). No metastatic processes or other malignancies were noted upon examination nor gynecological areas seemed affected during investigation  The distended appendix itself exhibited no apparent leakages nor adhesions with nearby structures making isolation easier for performing necessary surgical manipulations without damaging tissues further (Figure2). Right hemicolectomy involved careful handling that avoided rupture or leakage within the appendix while ensuring negative margins were maintained. Finally, a stapled functional end-to-end ileo-colic anastomosis was performed.  Post-operation, the patient experienced an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital on day 6. Follow-up in the outpatient clinic six weeks later showed no complications or adverse events related to this procedure.  Histological examination of tissues obtained during surgery revealed a low-grade appendicular mucinous neoplasm with negative margins indicating complete removal of affected tissue with no involvement of nearby mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure3). The histopathology report further described certain distinguishing features including flattened epithelium located atop marked fibrosis surrounding focal dystrophic calcification across appendiceal wall seen at both medium and high power viewing levels (Figure4).  The presence of an intestinal type covering epithelium comprising crowded columnar cells with basal, hyperchromatic nuclei and large amounts of apical mucin further supported this diagnosis. Evidence of minimal dysplastic changes confirmed that these findings were consistent with appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  It is important to note that fibrosis and chronic inflammation observed in histological sections are considered secondary changes resulting from luminal compression present in long-standing disease states like this one.  In conclusion, this clinical case involves a patient who presented initially without clear origins for her symptoms. However, careful evaluation through imaging techniques such as CT scan allowed for identification of a sausage-like cystic mass originating from the appendix termed as appendiceal mucocele. Subsequent surgical intervention through right hemi-colectomy successfully removed affected tissues without causing complications leading to a full recovery for the patient. ",explain
"Case Presentation:  A patient presented to our hospital with complaints of a mass in the right side of their palate. Upon taking their medical history, we found that they had no previous history of similar illness, significant medical or surgical issues, or any family history of similar complaints. The patient had not sought treatment for this issue previously.  Upon general examination, the patient's vital parameters were normal and stable. There were no signs of jaundice or pallor. No other swelling was observed upon examination of the rest of the body. The systemic examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities.  On local examination, a globular mass with normal overlying mucosa was observed on the right side of the palate. The lesion appeared to originate from the mid part of the palate and extended up to the posterior border of the hard palate. It was non-tender, firm, non-compressible, and had well-defined margins. Posteriorly it was limited by the posterior margin of soft palate and anteriorly merged with it. Superiorly it extended into nasopharyngeal region.  The transillumination test performed on this mass yielded negative results. Further examination in otorhinolaryngology did not reveal any other significant abnormalities.  Based on this history and clinical examination findings, a diagnosis was made suggesting a solid non-infectious mass likely benign in nature originating from soft palate tissue.  To further investigate this condition and rule out potential infective etiology (palatal abscess), a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was recommended for paranasal sinuses assessment.  The CT scan used 128 slice spiral CT technology with coronal and saggital reformations for better imaging analysis. The results showed a well-defined homogeneously enhancing hypodense soft tissue lesion measuring approximately 4.27 cm X 4 cm X 4.5 cm. This lesion arose from t the right side of the soft palate and was in close proximity to the anterior border of the hard palate, posteriorly abutting the uvula, inferiorly reaching towards the tongue, and superiorly extending into the nasopharyngeal wall. Lateral to it, it was seen to abut the right lateral nasopharyngeal wall. The surrounding structures showed no signs of infiltration and well-defined planes were observed. There was no evidence of central necrosis or secondary infection.  Based on these radiological features, a benign etiology neoplastic mass was suspected. The possibility of other clinical diagnosis such as palatal abscess was completely ruled out.  To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy was performed on the excised mass during surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical excision resulted in a 5 × 4 cm mass which was subsequently closed with advancement of adjacent mucosa.  The histopathological examination revealed epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells within the specimen. These findings along with other features were consistent with pleomorphic adenoma (PA), confirming our suspicion.  Preoperative blood and urine investigations were conducted before surgery and all results fell within normal limits. This indicated that there were no underlying systemic issues contributing to this condition.  The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with satisfactory healing observed after surgery. A follow-up period of one year showed no signs of recurrence or complications related to this condition.  Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign tumor that commonly arises from salivary gland tissue but can occur elsewhere in the body as well. In this case, it originated from soft palate tissue. Although benign, pleomorphic adenomas have potential for local recurrence if not completely excised. Regular follow-up is important after surgical removal to monitor for any signs or symptoms suggestive o f recurrence or metastasis. Patients should be educated about these potential risks and advised on how to recognize them at an early stage.  In conclusion, this clinical case presented a patient with a globular mass on the right side of their palate. Through a series of clinical examinations, radiological imaging, and histopathological analysis, it was determined that the mass was a pleomorphic adenoma originating from the soft palate. Surgical excision successfully removed the tumor and no recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. This case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for benign neoplastic masses in order to achieve optimal patient outcomes.",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with an abdominal pregnancy at 32 weeks and 3 days gestation. An abdominal pregnancy is a rare condition where the fertilized egg implants and develops outside of the uterus, typically within the abdomen.   In this case, the patient had previously undergone an obstetrical ultrasound two days before admission, which showed a live fetus in her abdomen with severe oligoamnios (reduced amniotic fluid). The placenta was found to be attached to her polymyomatous uterus (a uterus with multiple fibroids) and possibly on the omentum (a layer of tissue covering the abdominal organs), without any contact with major blood vessels.  Due to these findings, she was referred to our service for management. The patient provided some relevant background information, such as having her first menstrual period at 12 years old and having regular menstrual cycles lasting 30 days, with bleeding lasting for four days. She reported not using any contraception methods and had her first sexual intercourse at 16 years old. She also mentioned having had six sexual partners throughout her life.  Additionally, she disclosed a previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Chlamydia infection. Her blood group is A rhesus positive, and she has no known allergies or history of blood transfusions. Furthermore, she has been pregnant five times before: two full-term deliveries resulting in healthy baby boys weighing 3,700 grams and 4,300 grams respectively; eight years of secondary infertility following the first delivery; treatment for a tubal pregnancy; and emergency removal of another ectopic pregnancy from her right fallopian tube.  On examination during admission, it was noted that the patient's general condition was good and all vital parameters were normal. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations did not reveal any abnormalities either. Her abdomen displayed a Pfannenstiel incision scar from a previous cesarean section surgery. Upon palpation, fetal parts were easily felt beneath the abdominal wall. The distance between the symphysis pubis and sternum measured 38 centimeters, while the abdominal circumference was 90 centimeters. The fetus was in a transverse lie (sideways position), and its heart rate was normal at 146 beats per minute. Bowel sounds were also found to be normal.  A thorough examination of the cervico-vaginal area revealed no abnormalities in the mucosa, and the cervix was closed but slightly displaced to the left. Digital vaginal exploration indicated a long, firm, and closed cervix consistent with a pregnancy of 16 weeks gestation.  Based on these findings, a working diagnosis was made for an abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus at around 34 weeks and 2 days gestation. It was determined that urgent intervention would be necessary after lung maturation of the fetus with corticosteroids through two intramuscular injections of 12 milligrams of bethamethasone given within a 24-hour interval.  The patient underwent laparotomy under general anesthesia where it was discovered that approximately 80% of the placenta had implanted onto intestinal loops and omentum (visceral fat tissue), while about 20% remained attached to her uterine fundus (the upper part). The fetus exhibited talipes valgus (clubfoot) deformity in its right foot but did not display any signs of hemoperitoneum (blood in the abdomen). The uterus appeared soft, globular, and consistent with being at around week 16 gestation. No visible abnormalities were noted in her uterine adnexa or evidence of pelvic adhesions.  Once the fetus was extracted through cesarean section delivery, it received immediate medical attention due to severe respiratory distress and unfortunately passed away three hours later in pediatric intensive care.  Post-operatively, drain placement was necessary to manage potential complications. Two Delbet corrugated drains were inserted into the parieto-colic gutters (spaces in the abdominal cavity) and the pouch of Douglas (an area behind the uterus). The patient recovered well after surgery, and on the fourth day, the drains were removed.  Following discharge, she underwent follow-up care with serial abdominal ultrasounds and plasmatic beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) measurements. β-hCG is a hormone produced by placental cells during pregnancy, and its levels can help monitor pregnancy progression or detect residual tissues after delivery. In this case, her first β-hCG level was measured at 13,266 milliunits per milliliter while an ultrasound confirmed a vascularized placental mass.  It took eleven months for both the placenta and β-hCG levels to completely disappear from her body. Before leaving our care, we ensured that she received appropriate counseling on recognizing danger signs that would necessitate emergency medical attention such as abdominal pain, trauma to the abdomen, dizziness, or extreme fatigue.  In summary, this clinical case describes a rare situation of an abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus at 32 weeks and 3 days gestation. Prompt intervention through cesarean section delivery was performed despite challenging circumstances due to placental attachment and associated risks like severe bleeding. The mother recovered well post-operatively; however unfortunately her newborn experienced severe respiratory distress leading to its tragic demise shortly after birth.",explain
"In this clinical case, we encounter a patient who experienced deterioration in her health following delivery. The patient initially showed signs of confusion and decreased conscious level, prompting her transfer to a referral hospital for further assessment and treatment.  Upon arrival at the referral hospital, an intern doctor evaluated the patient and made a provisional diagnosis of sepsis with an unknown origin. This diagnosis led to the initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and fluid replacement therapy. However, it is concerning that no formal observations or documentation were recorded regarding the patient's conscious level or response to treatment during this time.  The following day, another healthcare professional reviewed the patient's condition after more than 48 hours since delivery. At this point, vital signs indicated an increased pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, elevated respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, blood pressure measuring 110/75 mmHg, and low oxygen saturation levels at 82% on room air. Unfortunately, no temperature was recorded due to a lack of available equipment in the unit.  Further assessment revealed clinical signs of dehydration such as concentrated urine along with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score indicating decreased consciousness (GCS=7). On physical examination, bilateral basal crepitations were heard over the chest while heart sounds appeared normal. The abdomen was distended upon palpation. Vaginal examination showed minimal lochia without any offensive odor.  The healthcare team promptly responded by providing oxygen therapy using nasal prongs at the highest available concentration (4L/min), resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels up to 92%. Intravenous antibiotics were administered while fluid resuscitation continued with infusions totaling 2 liters of normal saline solution. To investigate further complications within the abdominal region suggestive of sepsis or uterine rupture, an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed swiftly.  Despite efforts to swiftly diagnose and manage this complex situation after identifying significant free fluid/haemoperitoneum on the abdominal ultrasound, the diagnosis shifted towards sepsis with possible uterine rupture. Consequently, a decision was made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy.  During the surgery, a sub-umbilical midline incision was made, revealing significant blood-stained ascites (approximately 2-3 liters) and sloughy exudate throughout the intra-abdominal organs. Additionally, an identified posterior uterine rupture around 7cm in width was observed. The specific site of rupture remained low (1-2cm above internal os of cervix), without extending into the cervix or vagina laterally. To address both viability concerns and location of the rupture, a sub-total hysterectomy was performed while thoroughly irrigating and closing the abdomen.  In subsequent hours after surgery, despite improved urine output due to intravenous fluid administration, there was no improvement in conscious level for this patient; rather her condition further deteriorated with GCS scores dropping from 7 to 5 and then continuing down to 3. From that point onwards, treatment mainly focused on palliative care measures until she unfortunately succumbed to her illness several days later.  This clinical case highlights several important aspects in patient care: timely recognition and documentation of deterioration following delivery; prompt initiation of appropriate investigations such as ultrasound scans; early diagnosis and treatment interventions for sepsis or suspected uterine ruptures; meticulous surgical management including exploration via laparotomy when necessary; monitoring conscious level closely post-operatively along with other vital signs for comprehensive assessment of patient's condition.  It is crucial for healthcare providers involved in similar cases to emphasize thorough documentation throughout all stages of patient encounters. This facilitates effective communication between healthcare professionals involved in their care as well as ensuring accurate recording for future reference purposes. Additionally, continuous monitoring efforts involving multiple parameters must be carefully evaluated when addressing complex medical conditions like sepsis or potential surgical emergencies such as uterine ruptures.  In conclusion, this case underlines the importance of early recognition, appropriate investigation, intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach in managing deteriorating patients. It also serves as a reminder highlighting the significance of consistent documentation to facilitate effective communication and contribute to improved patient outcomes.",explain
"Title: Unfortunate Progression of Ewing's Sarcoma: A Case Study  Introduction: This clinical case explores the tragic progression of Ewing's sarcoma in an infant who faced considerable challenges due to financial constraints and limited access to healthcare services. The inability to receive timely diagnostics, appropriate treatment, and continuous care significantly impacted the patient's prognosis.  Background: Ewing's sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. It typically develops in bones or soft tissues, most commonly in the long bones such as the arms or legs. Early diagnosis followed by comprehensive treatment offers the best chance of a favorable outcome.  Case Presentation: In this case, a child presented with an initial complaint of swelling in the left forearm that gradually spread to involve the elbow joint. The early manifestation included pain upon touch and limitation of joint movement. The patient later developed intermittent low-grade fever along with axillary lymphadenopathy on examination.  Diagnostic Challenges: The lack of antenatal care allowed for speculation about potential exposure during pregnancy, but no definitive history was available for any known risk factors. Multiple herbal preparations were used during pregnancy; however, their role could not be ascertained clearly due to limited data.  Progression Pathway: Upon physical examination, an extensive swelling with hyperemic skin involving the left forearm was observed. An ulcer had also formed at one location in this area. Blood tests initially indicated sepsis-like patterns requiring antibiotic therapy; however, further investigations were hindered by financial constraints. A subsequent biopsy disclosed a small blue cell tumor but did not provide certainty regarding its origin - Desmoplastic small cell tumor, Ewing sarcoma,Ew Lymphoma were among potential differential diagnoses. Further immunohistochemistry testing provided conclusive evidence leading to a final diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma. Unfortunately,the delay in obtaining necessary investigations subsequently led to skeletal involvement observed on X-ray imaging. Treatment Complications: Surgical intervention, involving disarticulation of the left arm with an above-elbow amputation, was performed to address the progressive disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide was recommended but not attainable for this patient due to financial constraints.  Challenges Faced: The inability to procure cytotoxic drugs significantly impeded the patient's potential response to anticancer treatment. The financial burden persisted throughout the hospital stay, obstructing the requisition of further investigations such as a chest X-ray and a thoracolumbar spine X-ray.  Final Outcome: Despite receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy during the hospital stay along with efforts to manage diarrhea and dehydration episodes promptly, intermittent fevers persisted during treatment. Eventually,suspected sepsis led to an unfavorable outcome, resulting in the patient's untimely demise after two months on admission.  Conclusion: This case highlights several significant challenges faced by patients when financial constraints hinder their access to healthcare services. In resource-limited settings where comprehensive care is hindered by limited resources or lack of health insurance coverage, early detection and effective management of rare diseases like Ewing's sarcoma become extremely difficult. Efforts towards improving access to healthcare facilities,promoting awareness about early signs and symptoms among communities,and advocating for affordable medications are crucial in preventing similar tragedies from occurring in vulnerable populations.

"Case report 1: This clinical case involves a female patient who had a tympanoplasty on her right ear two weeks prior for chronic suppurative otitis media without any complications. She has a history of HIV, acquired from her mother, and has been on antiretroviral therapy since the age of 5. Her last CD4 count was low at 198 cells/µL. She has also experienced multiple episodes of rape starting at the age of 12, which led to her being placed on oral contraceptives and recently switched to Depo-Provera injections. The patient presented with convulsions and was found to have thrombosis in the sagittal vein along with meningeal enhancement and white matter edema in the left brain hemisphere.  After admission, she experienced more convulsions resulting in right-sided hemiparesis (weakness) and subsequent MRI findings indicated venous infarction (tissue damage due to lack of blood flow) with hemorrhagic components and edema in multiple lobes of the brain. She received anticonvulsants, anticoagulation therapy, and saw improvement over time.  She was discharged with mild residual weakness in her limbs but did not show any further deterioration during follow-up visits.  Case report 2: This case involves a middle-aged female patient who presented with an ongoing throbbing headache accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, light sensitivity (photophobia), dizziness, and double vision (diplopia). Her medical history revealed that she had been living with HIV for the past decade while taking medication. Lumbar puncture results were initially normal; however, she experienced worsening symptoms after discharge leading to readmission.  A repeated lumbar puncture showed increased pressure within the cerebrospinal fluid space along with normal laboratory results. A non-contrast CT scan revealed abnormalities in several sinuses including hyperdensity indicating possible thrombosis (clot formation) in the superior sagittal, right transverse, and left sigmoid sinuses. The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy and further experienced seizures without any lasting neurological deficits.  During her hospital stay, she also developed papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) which improved with intravenous Mannitol treatment. Her seizures were controlled with phenytoin, and she was discharged without any neurological impairment around three weeks later.  In both case reports, thrombosis of the cerebral sinuses led to various complications including seizures and neurological deficits. Timely intervention through anticoagulation therapy helped in preventing further deterioration or long-term consequences.  It is important to note that each patient had pre-existing conditions (HIV, history of sexual abuse) which may have contributed to their increased risk for thrombotic events. Additionally, proper monitoring and management during hospitalization played a crucial role in their recovery and prevention of permanent damage.  These cases highlight the importance of recognizing potential risk factors for thrombosis in patients with underlying conditions such as HIV or a history of trauma. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment can help manage these situations effectively while minimizing long-term complications. In both cases, the presence of HIV may have played a role in contributing to the development of thrombosis. HIV infection is associated with a heightened risk of hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction, which can predispose individuals to thrombotic events. The low CD4 cell count in both patients indicates a compromised immune system, further increasing their susceptibility to infections and inflammatory processes.  Case report 1 highlights additional factors that may have contributed to the development of thrombosis. The patient's history of sexual abuse could have led to psychological stress and dysregulation of the immune system, potentially promoting a prothrombotic state. Additionally, her use of oral contraceptives and subsequent switch to Depo-Provera injections may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to changes in hormone levels.  The presentation in case report 2 involves an acute severe headache with other neurological symptoms such as diplopia and papilledema. These are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, which can occur due to cerebral sinus thrombosis blocking normal cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways.  Thrombosis involving cerebral sinuses is known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is relatively rare but potentially life-threatening if not recognized promptly. Common presenting symptoms include headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits (such as weakness or visual disturbances), and signs suggestive of elevated intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema).  Diagnostic imaging techniques like CT scans with contrast or magnetic resonance venography help identify characteristic findings such as filling defects within cerebral sinuses or jugular veins consistent with thrombi formation.  Management typically includes anticoagulation therapy using drugs like heparin followed by long-term oral warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. Seizures occurring secondary to CVST often require treatment with antiepileptic medications for seizure control. In some cases, additional measures like Mannitol may be used to reduce intracranial pressure and alleviate associated symptoms.  It is crucial for patients with HIV and other risk factors, including a history of sexual abuse or the use of specific medications like oral contraceptives, to be educated about potential thrombotic risks. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and vigilance for symptoms suggestive of thrombosis are important in early detection and prompt intervention.  These clinical cases underscore the complex interplay between underlying medical conditions, psychosocial factors, and medication use in the context of thrombosis formation. Healthcare providers must have a comprehensive understanding of these interactions to provide appropriate care while considering individual patient circumstances. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving specialists such as infectious disease physicians, hematologists, neurologists, psychiatrists/psychologists, and social workers can ensure holistic management tailored to the unique needs of each patient.",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient with a history of HIV infection and renal insufficiency, who presented with symptoms suggesting heart and lung involvement. The patient had been on antiretroviral therapy for HIV and had stable kidney disease, but also had risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking and a previous episode of proteinuria.  The initial findings upon admission included low oxygen levels in the blood (desaturation), dilated jugular veins, mild ankle edema, normal blood pressure and pulse rate. An ECG showed a normal heart rhythm but also detected right axis deviation and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest X-ray revealed an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) with clear lung fields.  Laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin level, and platelet count. However, certain values were elevated including creatinine (indicative of impaired kidney function) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which can indicate liver or bone problems. On the other hand, liver enzymes ALT and AST were within normal ranges.  Arterial blood gas analysis indicated a slightly alkaline pH value along with normal levels of carbon dioxide (PC0 2 ) but reduced oxygen levels in the blood (PO 2 ). Glucose level was elevated above the reference range.  Two-dimensional echocardiography using both transthoracic and trans-oesophageal approaches revealed a large mobile mass located in the right atrium of the heart. This mass was attached to the lower part of the atrium extending into the inferior vena cava (IVC). There was no significant blockage of tricuspid valve flow by this mass, allowing free flow of blood between atrium and ventricle.  Further investigation through abdominal ultrasound confirmed extension of this mass into the IVC without any other notable abdominal findings.  Despite being on anticoagulant therapy for over two years, the mass did not decrease in size. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgery to remove the mass. The surgical findings revealed a creamy-colored mobile atrial mass that originated from the IVC and was easily detached from its junction with the superior vena cava (SVC). The histological analysis of the mass indicated dense fibrous tissue containing red blood cells and extensive calcification, consistent with a calcified thrombus (a blood clot).  Unfortunately, post-operatively, the patient experienced persistent low blood pressure and progressive right heart failure. Upon re-opening of her chest prior to her death, there was evidence of a dilated right atrium and hypokinetic (reduced movement) right ventricle without any fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac surrounding her heart.  Based on these findings, it is most likely that she died due to pulmonary embolism caused by fragments breaking off from the IVC thrombus and traveling to block arteries in her lungs.  This case study highlights several important points:   Firstly, individuals living with HIV are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease complications. This can be due to both viral infection-related factors as well as lifestyle factors like smoking.  Secondly, chronic kidney disease can contribute to cardiac abnormalities such as cardiomegaly and heart valve dysfunction. Renal insufficiency may also lead to an increased risk of developing venous thrombosis.  Thirdly, this case underscores how anticoagulant therapy may not always prevent further growth or fragmentation of existing clots. Surgical intervention might be necessary in some cases for complete removal.  Lastly, pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood clots dislodge from one part of the body (usually veins) and travel through circulation to block arteries supplying blood flow to lungs. It requires prompt diagnosis and treatment since it can result in significant morbidity or even mortality if left untreated.  In summary, this case demonstrates the complex interplay between HIV infection, renal disease, and cardiovascular complications. It also highlights the challenges in managing thrombotic events in patients with calcified thrombi and the potentially fatal consequences of pulmonary embolism.",explain
"This clinical case presents a patient with a complex medical and dental history. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which were being managed with medication. Four years ago, the patient received treatment from an ENT doctor for nasal myiasis, where maggots were removed through surgical debridement.  Recently, the patient underwent imaging tests of the brain that revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left temporal region. This lesion was diagnosed as a meningioma based on its characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scans.  Following this diagnosis, the patient was admitted to a private dental hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The multidisciplinary team informed the patient about the treatment plan and obtained informed consent before proceeding with surgery under general anesthesia. Maxillectomy, which is the surgical removal of part or all of the maxilla bone (upper jaw), was performed on the left side.  After surgery, regular debridements were carried out over two months to clean and care for the surgical wound. Sterile cultures were obtained from the wound to monitor for any signs of infection. Based on findings from these examinations and assessments, including intraoral examination, a provisional diagnosis of osteomyelitis (inflammation or infection of bone tissue) in relation to the surgical defect was given.  Other potential diagnoses considered included tuberculosis, squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer), tertiary syphilis (advanced stage syphilis), fungal infections such as aspergillosis or mucormycosis.  To further evaluate intraoral findings and confirm diagnosis, radiographic investigations such as panoramic radiograph (providing an overview image of teeth and jaw bones) and computed tomography were advised. These revealed multiple missing teeth in both maxillary arches along with significant changes consistent with previous left maxillectomy surgery.  Computed tomography also identified sinusitis involving left ethmoidal/sphenoidal sinuses and residual changes associated with osteomyelitis involving left pterygoid plates (part of the skull) and posterior wall of maxillary antrum (sinus cavity). The inflammatory marker erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased, indicating ongoing inflammation in the body. Additionally, glycosylated hemoglobin levels were elevated, suggesting that diabetes mellitus was not well-controlled.  An incisional biopsy was performed to further investigate the suspected osteomyelitis. The sample obtained from the left maxillary antrum revealed both bacterial and fungal growth upon culture sensitivity testing. Periodic acid Schiff staining demonstrated large non-septate fungal hyphae branching at right angles  Histopathological examination of the specimen showed cellular connective tissue stroma with mixed inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and lymphocytes. Numerous large non-septate fungal hyphae were observed, along with areas of necrosis and super-added bacterial infection. This combination of findings led to a final diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis with mucormycosis.  To address this complex condition, the patient underwent extensive unilateral endoscopic nasosinusal surgery, which involved debridement (removal) of infected tissue in the left maxillary sinus, anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells, as well as extensive removal of invaded mucosa under general anesthesia.  Surgical intervention included excision of fungal masses and necrotic slough from both left maxillary sinus and sphenoidal sinus. Necrotic mucosa was removed until healthy margins were visible. Liposomal amphotericin B antifungal medication was initiated immediately after surgery. Initially administered at 5 mg/kg dosage adjusted to 7.5 mg/kg after three weeks.  Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy comprising 21 sessions lasting 150 minutes each were provided to enhance treatment outcomes over a period four weeks along with systemic delivery (oral administration) antifungal drugs.  Post-operative follow-up visits showed negative cultures, meaning no signs of infection were detected. The patient was provided with an acrylic obturator, a dental prosthesis designed to fill the surgical defect and restore oral function. Soft liners were utilized to ensure a comfortable fit for the patient.  In summary, this clinical case presented a patient with chronic osteomyelitis and mucormycosis following previous maxillectomy surgery. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and dental professionals was utilized to diagnose and manage this complex condition.",explain
"Clinical Case: Bilateral Spermatocytic Seminoma with Inguinal Lymph Node Enlargement  In this clinical case, the patient presented with swelling on both sides of the scrotum. On the left side, there was a firm to hard non-tender swelling measuring approximately 11X8X6 cm3, which was associated with restricted mobility. The surface of the swelling was regular and transillumination test was negative. On examination of the right side, a similar firm to hard non-tender swelling measuring approximately 8X6X5 cm3 was found, also associated with restricted mobility.  The patient reported altered testicular sensations on the right side and absence of sensations on the left side. In addition to these findings, bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were swollen but non-tender and palpable.  Based on these clinical findings, a provisional diagnosis of bilateral testicular malignancy was made and further investigations were performed. Routine blood tests including hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count (types of white blood cells) and platelet count were within normal range.  Kidney function tests and liver function tests did not reveal any abnormalities. Chest radiograph showed no abnormality as well. Urine analysis including microscopic examination did not show any signs of disease or infection.  Special investigations included assessment of serum tumor markers such as Beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Beta HCG levels were elevated at 12 mIU/ml while AFP and LDH levels were normal.  Further imaging studies such as ultrasonography (USG) abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes without significant changes in their echosensitivity or morphology. The testes appeared multilobulated enlarged with multiple scattered whorled masses surrounded by peripheral vascularity, suggesting neoplastic nature.  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the enlargement of both testes. The left testis measured about 11X8.8X7.8 cm with heterogeneous hypodensity and mild enhancement on post-contrast imaging. Similarly, the right testis measured about 8X6.9X5.5 cm with similar characteristics.  Intraoperatively, a biopsy was performed on the suspicious area of the left testis and frozen sections were sent for histopathological examination which revealed malignancy (spermatocytic seminoma). Subsequently, a left-sided orchidectomy (removal of testis) along with spermatic cord and left inguinal lymph nodes was performed under general anesthesia.  Postoperative period for the patient was uneventful without any complications in recovery. Sutures were removed on day 10 and wound healing was normal.  After five days from surgery, an intraoperative biopsy of the right testis was done confirming another case of malignancy (spermatocytic seminoma). This diagnosis was later confirmed by immunohistochemistry as well.  Following these findings, a right-sided orchidectomy along with spermatic cord and right inguinal lymph nodes removal were performed after 15 days from surgery.  Histopathological studies revealed that both removed testes showed atrophy and multilobulated appearance microscopically. The evaluation also demonstrated atrophic seminiferous tubules with reduced spermatogenesis and dysplastic cells surrounded by infiltrates composed mainly of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages indicating inflammatory responses to neoplastic cells in both testes.  To prevent relapse or recurrence, prophylactic radiotherapy treatment was given to the patient for 15 days with a total dose of 20Gy (Gray - unit measurement equivalent to joules per kilogram) delivered. The patient was advised to follow up every 6 months. Presently, the patient is asymptomatic with normal follow-up CT scan and tumor markers within normal limits indicating no evidence of disease.  In conclusion, this clinical case presents a rare scenario of bilateral spermatocytic seminoma, a type of malignancy affecting the testes. The patient initially presented with bilateral non-tender scrotal swellings associated with restricted mobility along with altered or absent testicular sensations on both sides.  The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry following orchidectomy procedures on both sides along with removal of inguinal lymph nodes.  Thanks to timely investigation and appropriate treatment in the form of surgery followed by prophylactic radiotherapy, there has been no evidence of disease recurrence during subsequent follow-up visits.  Regular check-ups and continued monitoring will play an important role in assessing long-term outcome and ensuring the absence of any relapse or new disease manifestation.",explain
"Clinical Case 1: In this case, the patient underwent an urgent operation to drain a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in the frontal-temporal region of both sides of the brain. During the operation, a subdural hematoma escaped from a hole in the bone after opening up the protective covering of the brain (dura), despite high intracranial pressure. The surgery was successfully completed without any complications, and the patient's vital signs remained stable throughout.   After confirming that there was no more air trapped in the brain (intracranial pneumatosis), a closed drainage system was put in place to drain any excess fluid that may have accumulated after surgery. However, due to worsening consciousness disturbance, an emergency CT scan was performed 2 hours after surgery which showed multiple areas of bleeding within brain tissue (parenchymal hemorrhage). Despite this unexpected finding, postoperative recovery went smoothly.  Instead of opting for surgical intervention for these new bleedings, doctors decided to continue with conservative treatment which included closely monitoring neurological signs for 6 days while being cared for in an intensive care unit dedicated to patients with neurological conditions (NICU). The length of hospital stay was extended to 20 days because mental disturbances persisted following surgery; however, these issues were successfully addressed during this time frame.  Eventually, with no lasting neurological deficits except for some minor language barriers remaining, the patient was discharged from hospital. At a follow-up appointment two months later, no abnormalities were found on CT scan and all remnants of hematoma had been completely absorbed.  Clinical Case 2: In this case study involving an 82-year-old man with weakness in his limbs and frequent falls over a period of one month following a history of cerebral infarction (stroke), arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), and coronary heart disease while being treated with rivaroxaban medication. A CT scan showed evidence of subdural hematoma on the right side of the brain with compression of brain tissue. The patient also exhibited reduced response time and weakness in his left limbs.  Urgent evacuation of the subdural hematoma was carried out by creating a single hole in the parietal bone on the right side while continuing oral rivaroxaban administration. A drainage catheter was placed routinely in the prefrontal region of the brain. Surprisingly, visual field defects were observed on the right side following surgery, but vital signs remained normal throughout.  Postoperative CT scan revealed a small amount of air trapped in an area at the front part of the brain (prefrontal pneumocephalus) and bleeding in the occipital lobe on the right side (right occipital lobe hemorrhage). However, no acute bleeding was found within that same space where initial subdural hematoma had been present. Removal of drainage tube was delayed until 4 days postoperatively.  As time progressed, gradual absorption of occipital hematoma occurred without requiring any additional surgical intervention. However, slight postural instability was noticed during neurological evaluation, leading to physical therapy for balance improvement. At a 2-month follow-up appointment, there were indications that patient's condition had significantly improved as he could walk unaided and CT scans showed no abnormalities.  Clinical Case 3: In this instance involving an 80-year-old man experiencing moderate dizziness and headaches persisting for 20 days with a medical history including hypertension (high blood pressure), ischemic heart disease (reduced blood flow to heart muscle), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma; neurological assessment revealed confusion and difficulty maintaining balance while walking. A CT scan revealed a large chronic subdural hematoma on his right side causing displacement of midline structures towards left.  To address this issue promptly, urgent surgery involved creating one burr-hole in the skull followed by evacuation of the subdural hematoma on the right side. A drainage device was placed routinely as part of the surgical procedure. However, on the second day after surgery, a sudden spasm of airway muscles occurred (airway spasm), leading to unstable blood oxygen levels. Emergency tracheal incubation was performed to stabilize vital signs, alongside closing off the drainage device.  An emergency CT scan revealed a small area of bleeding within brain tissue located at the back part of brain (occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage). On day three, due to worsening condition and respiratory distress, patient required transfer to an intensive care unit for further care including assistance with breathing using ventilator support.  In order to aid breathing in long-run and subsequent removal difficulties with normal trachea cannula within short time spans, doctors decided it was necessary for patient to undergo tracheotomy (creation of an alternative air passage through the neck). Removal of drainage tube was delayed until fifth day after surgery.  Patient showed gradual improvement over time and successfully detached from ventilator after one week following surgery. He returned to a general ward while continuing treatment for pulmonary inflammation caused by infection for an additional 10 days. Ultimately, patient was discharged from hospital in stable condition with mild pulmonary inflammation present but no other major complications aside from that. The total hospitalization period lasted one month.  At two-month follow-up examination after discharge, patient remained in good overall health and did not exhibit any evidence suggesting recurrence based on head CT scans that were conducted during this time frame.",explain
"In the first clinical case, a patient presented with a lesion in their right mandibular crest that had been developing for about a month. The neurological examination revealed reduced sensation in the lower lip and chin on one side, which raised concerns about malignancy. Further imaging with a craniofacial CT scan showed that the soft tissues of the right lateral mandible were infiltrated and there was an osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest near tooth 45. Additionally, multiple lymph nodes were found bilaterally in locations such as submandibular, supraclavicular, and jugulo-carotid regions. The largest lymph node measured 20 mm.  To determine the nature of the lesion, a biopsy was performed. Histological analysis combined with immunohistochemical examination revealed that it was a large B-cell lymphoma originating from the gingiva of the mandible. Microscopically, there were large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm and nuclei showing significant atypia (anomalous features). Mitoses (cell divisions) and apoptotic bodies (cell death marks) were also observed at relatively high levels within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, necrotic changes (tissue death) were extensive within this tumor specimen.  In immunohistochemistry staining for specific markers present on cells' surface or inside them), it was found that tumor cells strongly expressed CD45 and CD20 markers diffusely throughout their population but did not express CD3 or CK markers. Based on these findings, treatment for large B-cell lymphoma was initiated in consultation with an oncologist-hematologist department where chemotherapy-based therapy began.  Notably, after receiving several cycles of chemotherapy treatment as per protocol guidelines for this type of lymphoma management appeared to be improving significantly for this patient.  Moving onto our second case study - involving a 16-year-old male patient - he had been previously diagnosed with acute articular rheumatism and had a history of erysipelas (a skin infection) at the age of 7. This patient was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to a worsening general condition. Initially, he experienced epigastric pain, vomiting, and flu-like symptoms for which he received symptom-based treatment.  The patient's condition deteriorated further with increasing pain in the right lower abdomen associated with diarrhea-like bowel movements. He was referred to the department where I work for assessment and management of a swelling in his left mandible that was suspected to be an abscess originating from dental issues.  Upon examination, we found palpable lymph nodes on the left side of his neck along with normal mouth opening. The intraoral examination revealed an extensive mass affecting gingiva between teeth 34 and 37. Terminal mobility (looseness) of these teeth had been progressing over three weeks' time. Neurological examination revealed sensory changes in the area supplied by the left inferior alveolar nerve.  To assess this patient thoroughly, radiological imaging was performed, revealing bone destruction involving tooth furcation or bifurcation (area where roots separate) in the left molar region.  Further investigations included abdominal CT scan which indicated a tumor mass near ileocecal junction (where small intestine meets large intestine), along with peritoneal carcinomatosis (spread within abdominal cavity). Multiple lymph nodes were also found within mediastinal regions as determined by CT scans; notably, one lymph node measured around 31*21mm in size.  Blood tests showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an indication of inflammation or tissue damage within body systems - CRP value at 117 - as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme levels - LDH at 789 IU/L).  Taking all these findings into consideration alongside negative HIV serology results suggesting absence of HIV infection, we suspected an association between the oral lesion and the abdominal tumor, raising concerns about lymphoma as a possible cancer type.  To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy of the oral lesion was performed, and surgical intervention was carried out in the general surgery department for removal of the abdominal tumor. Results confirmed our suspicion of Burkitt lymphoma with primary manifestation in abdominal region that had metastasized to secondary oral locations.  Histologically, there was diffuse growth pattern observed consisting of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with basophilic cytoplasm. The presence of numerous mitoses suggested rapid proliferation rates within these malignant cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated B-cell phenotype with positive staining for markers CD20 and CD10, while expression level for Bcl6 marker varied among various cells. The proliferation index Ki67 indicated an extremely high proliferative rate at 100%.  After surgical management and postoperative care without any evident complications or concerns, this patient was referred to onco-hematology department where chemotherapy treatment began following standardized protocols as per evidence-based guidelines.  Unfortunately, despite prompt initiation of treatment, this patient's clinical course rapidly deteriorated due to aggressive nature of Burkitt lymphoma resulting in his death approximately one month after diagnosis.  It is crucial to note that both cases illustrated here exemplify aggressive forms of lymphomas - large B-cell type in first case; Burkitt lymphoma in second case - requiring prompt diagnosis and early initiation/interventions via chemotherapy treatments provided by competent healthcare professionals experienced in managing hematologic malignancies such as onco-hematologists.",explain
"Title: Paratubal Borderline Serous Tumor: A Unique Clinical Case  Introduction: This clinical case describes the diagnostic journey of a patient who presented with an ovarian cyst. Through various imaging techniques and histopathological analysis, it was determined that the patient had a rare paratubal borderline serous tumor. This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the case, highlighting key diagnostic findings and treatment options.  Case Presentation: The patient in this case is a postmenopausal woman who experienced menopause at age 48 without any complications. She had no significant medical or surgical history and had not received hormonal therapy. Routine blood tests and serum tumor marker analysis indicated normal levels for carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 125, and human epididymis protein 4.  Diagnostic Imaging: Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) revealed a left ovarian unilocular cyst measuring approximately 6cm × 5cm × 4cm. The cyst exhibited low-level internal echoes, a thin wall with smooth margins, and no septa or papillary projections. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ECT) confirmed the presence of a unilocular cystic lesion without enhancing solid intramural nodules or lymphadenopathy.  Surgical Intervention: Due to concerns about possible malignancy based on the progressive growth observed in this postmenopausal woman, laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery was performed. During laparoscopic inspection, it was discovered that the cyst originated from the ampullary and fimbrial regions of the left fallopian tube. The left fallopian tube appeared normal while the left ovary showed signs of atrophy.  Histopathological Analysis: Frozen sections prepared from surgically removed specimens confirmed that the cyst was benign; however, further examination revealed polypoid lesions with nuclear atypism and stratification. These histological characteristics were consistent with a borderline tumor. The final diagnosis was confirmed as a paratubal borderline serous tumor.  Treatment and Follow-up: Following the surgical removal of the cyst, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) were performed to ensure comprehensive management. While further staging surgery was recommended, the patient opted for close follow-up instead.  Outcomes: Postoperative evaluation using retrospective CT imaging demonstrated clear separation between the left ovary, fallopian tube, and paratubal cyst. The patient remained asymptomatic during follow-up visits conducted every three months over a 24-month period, with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis observed.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic investigations in postmenopausal women presenting with ovarian cysts. Despite initial indications suggesting benignity based on tumor markers and imaging results, surgical intervention was necessary to establish an accurate diagnosis. In this particular case, comprehensive treatment involving hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ensured optimal disease management.  The rarity of paratubal borderline serous tumors necessitates further research to develop standardized treatment protocols and gain better insights into their behavior. Although adjuvant surgical treatment is typically recommended in cases lacking complete staging information as seen here, individual patient preferences should be carefully considered when determining the most appropriate course of action.  It is crucial to underscore that close follow-up through periodic pelvic ECT scans, TVS assessments, and monitoring tumor markers played a pivotal role in ensuring early detection of any potential recurrence or metastasis while providing reassurance for the patient's overall well-being.  In conclusion, this clinical case presents an unusual manifestation of paratubal borderline serous tumor that underscores the need for meticulous diagnostic evaluations in patients with ovarian cysts even when initial findings appear benign. Collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the latest diagnostic tools can ensure accurate diagnosis, optimal treatment decisions, and successful long-term outcomes.",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with several symptoms and findings that ultimately led to a diagnosis of Pott's disease, also known as tuberculous spondylitis. Pott's disease is a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine, resulting in inflammation and destruction of the vertebrae.  The initial presentation of the patient included an epithelioid granulomatous inflammatory process seen on pleural biopsy. However, tests for mycobacteria infection using Ziehl-Neelsen stain and culture were negative. Despite not having respiratory symptoms, the patient had significant spinal tenderness and limited range of motion in the dorso-lumbar spine.  Further evaluation revealed anemia (hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dl) and mild leukocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (72%). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 80 mm and C-reactive protein (CRP) was also increased at 27 mg/l, indicating ongoing inflammation.  Imaging studies such as lumbar x-ray showed osteocondensation in L1-L2 vertebrae, while chest x-ray revealed a small pleural effusion on the left side. A dorso-lumbar MRI demonstrated features suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis involving L1-L2 vertebrae along with epiduritis. Additionally, there was evidence of abscess formation in the left psoas muscle which communicated with collections within the vertebral bodies.  In order to alleviate symptoms and drain the psoas abscess, CT-guided evacuation was performed, revealing purulent material that did not grow in cultures or stain positive for bacteria using Gram or Ziehl-Neelsen methods.  Given a high prevalence rate of tuberculosis in this patient population along with previous history of pleural tuberculosis and characteristic MRI findings, a diagnosis of Pott's disease was made. Treatment was initiated and prolonged to 9 months, along with the use of a spinal brace for stabilization of the vertebral column.  Despite adherence to treatment, the patient's low back pain worsened after 6 months. Subsequently, purulent collections were identified in gluteal and left trochanteric regions. Imaging studies confirmed spondylodiscitis in L1-L2 vertebrae and an enlargement of the left psoas abscess. GeneXpert® MTB/RIF testing detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis with resistance to Rifampicin, while Hain® test revealed high-level resistance to Isoniazid and Ofloxacin but sensitivity to Kanamycin and Amikacin.  Due to these drug resistances, the patient was transferred to a multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis unit for further management. Drainage of superficial collections in gluteal and trochanteric areas was performed under ultrasound guidance.  The patient then initiated second-line anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) consisting of amikacin, clofazimine, prothionamide, linezolid, delamanide, pyrazinamide, et ethambutol based on susceptibility testing results. Over time, inflammatory lumbar pain improved significantly while weight gain occurred along with resolution of soft tissue collections.  After 20 months of second-line ATT therapy without adverse events other than limb paresthesias managed with vitamin therapy, imaging follow-up demonstrated no residual collections in thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scans. The MRI showed a vertebral fracture at L1-L2 and only a small collection measuring less than 1 cm without enhancement after gadolinium injection.  This comprehensive treatment resulted in stabilization of vertebral lesions without any new collections formation or worsening symptoms.The patient completed therapy and was declared cured; subsequently participating in a rehabilitation program involving stretching and strengthening exercises for the spinal muscles.  In summary, this case highlights the challenges faced in diagnosing and treating Pott's disease, a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine. Despite drug resistance and complications such as abscess formation, aggressive treatment with second-line ATT led to successful recovery and favorable outcomes for the patient.",explain
"Title: Treatment and Recovery from Expansive Cell Granuloma in the Hand  Introduction: Expansive Cell Granuloma (ECG) is a rare, benign bone tumor that can occur in various parts of the body. This clinical case describes the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of a patient presenting with chronic pain, finger enlargement, and limited joint mobility in the hand. A surgical technique known as Tsuge's method was employed to successfully remove the tumor.  Case Presentation: The patient complained of chronic pain in her fifth finger along with other symptoms such as paresthesia (tingling sensation), tactile pain, swelling in the ulnar region of her hand, crepitation (cracking sound), and restricted flexion of her proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). Upon clinical examination, a palpable mass with considerable volume was observed on her phalanx. X-ray images revealed complete absorption of cortical periosteal calcification leading to increased dimensions of the phalanx. Additionally, radiographs indicated a well-demarcated pathologic fracture with cortical thinning along with a radiolucent mass within this fractured area.  Diagnosis: Hematochemical analysis ruled out any rheumatic disease or elevated uric acid levels as potential causes for these symptoms. These findings allowed for exclusionary diagnosis leading to ECG as a probable cause. Tinel's sign and Phalen's maneuver were negative during physical examination.  Treatment Approach: Based on these observations and diagnostic results, surgical intervention using Tsuge's technique was selected for this case. The surgery involved disarticulating the fifth metacarpal bone together with amputation of that specific ray within the hand structure under axillary block anesthesia.  Surgical Procedure: A volar Z-Brunner type incision followed by a dorsal longitudinal extension along digit five allowed sufficient exposure for tumor excision. An incision pattern resembling Y-shaped began dorsally at the base of the fifth metacarpal and continued toward the fourth metacarpal. It then merged into a V-shaped incision on the palmar side near the proximal transverse palmar plica. The dorsal skin flap was carefully separated to expose both the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle and bone segment requiring resection.  Key aspects of this procedure included an oblique mid-diaphysis osteotomy of the fifth metacarpal bone while maintaining its base for distal extensor attachment, sectioning tendons aligned with digit five extensor muscles, ligature and cauterization of vessels and nerve endings, removal of distal fifth metacarpal bone section, suture closure between tendon remnants and nearby muscles to fill gaps created by bone removal, palm suturing followed by dorsal hand skin closures with a bandage applied postoperatively.  Rehabilitation: Functional rehabilitation commenced two weeks after surgery with a focus on improving range of motion and grip strength in the hand. A one-year post-operative check-up indicated no subjective problems reported by the patient. The patient demonstrated complete functional recovery with satisfactory cosmetic results.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights an uncommon presentation of expansive cell granuloma in a patient complaining of chronic pain, paresthesia, limited joint mobility, swelling, and finger enlargement. Through successful surgical intervention following Tsuge's method, which involved disarticulation of affected bones within digit five along with soft tissue repair techniques for tendon reattachment, this patient experienced complete functional recovery within one year post-surgery.  This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis using comprehensive clinical examinations along with imaging techniques like X-rays. Surgical management guided by well-established techniques can enable successful treatment outcomes and substantial post-operative recovery in patients presenting symptoms associated with expansive cell granulomas in their hands.",explain
"Title: Lip Repositioning Procedure for Gummy Smile Correction: A Safe and Effective Esthetic Solution  Introduction: Orthognathic surgery and lip repositioning procedure (LRP) are two treatment options available to patients with a gummy smile or vertical maxillary excess (VME). This clinical case presents a patient who opted for LRP to address their gummy smile, aiming to avoid the higher morbidity and costs associated with orthognathic surgery. This article explores the technique of lip repositioning, its benefits, risks, post-operative care, and long-term outcomes.  Lip Repositioning Procedure: During the lip repositioning procedure, local anesthesia is administered to the vestibular mucosa and lip using Mepivacaine 2% with adrenaline 1:80,000. The incision outline is marked on the dried tissue using mucogingival junction as a reference line. Incisions are made in the surgical area from maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar. Partial thickness flaps are raised superiorly and inferiorly in this surgical area. An epithelial band of approximately 10-12 mm is excised leaving underlying connective tissue exposed. Care is taken not to damage any minor salivary glands in the submucosa.  Post-operative Care: Following surgery, immediate improvement in facial appearance and smile aesthetics is observed. Post-operative instructions given include maintaining a soft diet, limiting facial movements, avoiding brushing around the surgical site for 14 days, placing ice packs over the upper lip as needed for swelling management, rinsing gently with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily for two weeks along with prescribed antibiotics (Amoxicillin) and analgesics (Ibuprofen).  Outcome Evaluation: The patient's healing process occurs smoothly without significant post-operative complications such as bruising or extraoral swelling. The suture line heals as a concealed scar in the upper lip mucosa, remaining invisible when smiling. The patient reports minimal post-operative pain during smiling that lasts for approximately one week. Two weeks after the procedure, sutures are removed.  Long-term Follow-up: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the lip repositioning procedure, follow-up appointments with the patient are scheduled every three months. Gingival display measurements are taken at each visit. At baseline, the patient's gingival display was measured at 7-8 mm, significantly reducing to 3 mm at both three and six months postoperatively. There is no significant difference observed between these two time points regarding changes in gingival display. However, a partial relapse is noticed after 12 months.  Discussion: The lip repositioning procedure has proved to be a safe and effective surgical technique for correcting gummy smiles caused by excessive gingival display. It limits SMAS (elevator smile muscles) retraction by excising an epithelial band while maintaining esthetic outcomes for patients.  Benefits of LRP include lower morbidity compared to orthognathic surgery and reduced cost-effectiveness due to lesser surgical complexity and duration. Furthermore, LRP allows patients to avoid substantial jaw movement or bony adjustments.  However, it should be noted that like any other surgical intervention or esthetic procedure, there are potential limitations associated with LRP as well:  1. Partial relapse: The case study reports partial relapse observed after one year following surgery. 2. Individual variation: Patient anatomy and muscle function may influence treatment outcomes. 3. Careful case selection: A thorough assessment of individual expectations is necessary before offering LRP as an alternative treatment option. 4.Safety Profile: While this method minimizes side-effects such as extraoral swelling or bruising, all patients should be aware of potential complications related to anesthesia or wound healing.  Conclusion: The lip repositioning procedure offers patients an alternative surgical solution to correct gummy smiles with significant aesthetic improvements. This case report emphasizes risk clarification, obtaining informed consent, and managing patient expectations regarding potential outcomes and the possibility of relapse.  Despite some limitations such as possible partial relapse observed after a year, this esthetic procedure has proven to be a safe and reliable technique supported by minimal side-effects. Long-term follow-up is vital to monitor post-operative results and shape realistic patient expectations for successful outcomes in gummy smile correction.  [Word Count: 601]",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with an obstructed left ureteric calculus at the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ). The patient's blood workup revealed elevated creatinine and potassium levels, indicating obstructive uropathy with acute kidney injury. As a result, the patient underwent emergency cystoscopy, left ureteroscopy, stone fragmentation, and Double J (DJ) ureteric stent insertion.  During the procedure, it was discovered that the patient had significant distal left ureteric narrowing at the VUJ with a calculus proximal to the narrowing. The stone was fragmented successfully and a DJ stent was placed to promote urinary drainage. Additionally, a Foley catheter was inserted to assist in urine flow.  In post-operative recovery, however, the patient experienced desaturation with oxygen saturation dropping to 80-85% on room air. To maintain adequate oxygenation, he required 8 L/min of oxygen supplementation through a face mask. Due to this complication and other concerns related to his condition after surgery, he was transferred to a ward for further monitoring and management.  Around 12 hours after being transferred to the ward, his vital signs showed tachycardia at 130 beats per minute along with low blood pressure readings ranging from 80/50 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg. On examination, he appeared alert but had cool and clammy extremities. Bilateral basal crepitations were observed during respiratory examination.  Further investigations revealed an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with ST-segment depressions and T wave inversion in anterior and inferior leads compared to his preoperative ECG. Moreover, troponin-T levels were significantly elevated at 174.1 pg/ml (normal range: 0-14 pg/ml), suggesting myocardial damage or injury.  Additional laboratory parameters indicated abnormalities as well: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 494 IU/L (normal range: 135-225 IU/L), pro-BNP at 375 pg/ml (normal range: 0-125 pg/ml), procalcitonin at 1.67 ng/ml (normal range: 0-2 ng/ml), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 312 mg/L (normal range: 0.5-5 mg/L), INR of 1.15, ferritin levels elevated to 1531 µg/l (normal range:22-322 µg/l), and D-dimer levels slightly elevated to 0.63 µg/ml (normal range:0-0.5 µg/ml).  A portable chest x-ray exhibited bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates with some coalescence observed in the periphery of the lungs, a pattern consistent with CO-RADS classification level 5, highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection. This diagnosis was later confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  Due to his deteriorating condition and the presence of myocardial injury, the patient was transferred to an isolation intensive care unit where he began receiving anticoagulant therapy as part of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) protocol. The treatment included subcutaneous enoxaparin, clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin.  Unfortunately, within hours of transfer to critical care, the patient's clinical status worsened rapidly leading to intravenous inotropic support being initiated. Subsequently, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.  Despite medical efforts and attempts made according to American Cardiac Life Support guidelines during cardiopulmonary resuscitation following a cardiac arrest episode, resuscitation measures were unsuccessful after approximately 30 minutes. The patient was ultimately pronounced dead.  In summary, this clinical case involves a patient presenting with an obstructive left ureteric calculus, which required urgent intervention. However, post-surgery complications arose including desaturation, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Further investigations revealed evidence of acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection with pulmonary involvement (CO-RADS 5), and myocardial damage as evidenced by elevated troponin levels and abnormalities in the ECG. Despite intensive care management and resuscitation efforts following a cardiac arrest event, the patient unfortunately did not survive.",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with a concerning wound on the sole of their foot, leading to suspicion of leprosy. The patient, an elderly man, also had a history of hypertension and heart failure. After further evaluation, it was determined that the wound was not due to leprosy but instead diagnosed as pyogenic granuloma.  Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion that commonly occurs on the skin or mucous membranes. It often appears as a rapidly growing and bleeding red or purple bump. In this case, the ulceration on the patient's foot was significant and continued to grow.  To determine the nature of the wound, several tests were conducted. Blood work showed within normal ranges for white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and platelet count (Plt). Fasting blood glucose levels were also within normal limits. Urea levels indicated kidney function at 0.42 G/L, while creatinine levels were slightly elevated at 6.10 mg/l.  Additional tests were performed to rule out other potential causes such as HIV and leprosy. HIV serology came back negative, and tests for leprosy on the wound yielded negative results as well.  Culture analysis of pus collected from the foot revealed Staphylococcus aureus presence but indicated sensitivity to cefixime, amino acidsides, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid combination therapy, and rifampicin antibiotics.  A biopsy was then performed on three different locations within the wound for further analysis under a microscope. The results showed focal ulceration on the surface and superficial dermis with granulation tissue formation containing elongated or oval vascular structures made up of non-atypical benign endothelial cells. There was also a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with fibroblasts and significant fibroblastic proliferation comprised of elongated fusiform cells. Additionally, slight hyperplasia in the surface malpighian epithelium was noted, but no malignant cells were observed.  Based on these findings, the diagnosis for this patient was a pyogenic granuloma, also known as botryomycome.  Treatment options were discussed with the patient's family. However, they refused surgical excision recommended by healthcare providers. As an alternative, the patient was initiated on antibiotic therapy, receiving ceftriaxone 1g twice daily and gentamicin 80mg twice daily for ten days. Daily wound care involved washing with a water-based solution containing betadine.  Unfortunately, after completion of this treatment course, the patient's condition did not significantly improve. Surgical excision was proposed again; however, the family rejected it once more. Considering that rifampicin has been shown to have effects on chronic leprous lesions and considering dapsone’s pharmacodynamic action in such situations; therefore dapsone/rifampicin combination therapy was suggested to the patient as both medications were available free of cost at their healthcare center.  The patient received dapsone/rifampicin treatment for one month with regular follow-ups scheduled throughout this period. After one month of treatment with this regimen showed very encouraging results; there was remarkable regression of swelling and total disappearance of exuding wounds that used to bleed even on minor contact.  In summary, this clinical case highlights initial suspicion of leprosy due to an ulceration and budding wound on the foot which ultimately led to a diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma upon further examination under microscopy and culture analysis. Despite initially unsuccessful intervention attempts using antibiotics recommended based on culture analysis results alone, subsequent treatment using dapsone/rifampicin combination therapy resulted in a notable improvement in the patient's condition.",explain
"Title: Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) in Systemic Sclerosis: A Clinical Case Study  Introduction: In this clinical case, we present a patient with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc) who developed symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD). TMD is a group of conditions characterized by pain and dysfunction in the jaw joint and muscles that control jaw movement. The patient's symptoms gradually worsened over time, leading to seeking specialized consultation. This article will highlight the diagnostic approach, treatment strategies, and outcomes observed in managing TMD in this particular case.  Case Presentation: The patient had a medical history of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis diagnosed three years ago. She was receiving various medications for SSc including methotrexate, colchicine, amlodipine, methylprednisolone, cholecalciferol, sulodexide, acidumfolicum and Lysinacetylsalicylas. One year after her initial diagnosis with SSc, she started experiencing temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and muscle-related symptoms which gradually worsened.  Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination of the orofacial region, the patient exhibited several characteristic features associated with SSc including masklike facies with smooth and tight facial skin devoid of normal animation lines. Additionally,sclerodactyly complicated by digital ulcers affecting mainly her hands was noted. Furthermore,lung fibrosis causing moderate lung impairment led to flexion contracture and claw-like deformity.  A thorough evaluation revealed limitation of finger movements suggesting scleroderma involvement.Extensive palpation indicated bilateral stiffness in masticatory muscles upon palpation as well as restricted mandibular movements such as mouth opening limited to 23mm,and deviation towards right side.Moreover,painful TMJ palpation predominantly on right side was reported.Restricted condylar movementon the affected side was also identified.  Diagnostic Assessment: To evaluate the TMJ and potential masticatory muscle fibrosis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed in both open-mouth and closed-mouth positions. The findings showed internal derangement of TMJ, bilateral mandibular condylar process resorption,and disk deformations with a heterogeneous appearance. Bilateral mandibular condylar processes exhibited subchondral geodes and thinned cortical bone on sagittal and coronal views of MRI. Hypomobility in open mouth position was observed suggesting functional impairment.A notable observation was the absence of masticatory muscle fibrosis.  Diagnosis and Treatment: A diagnosis of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) with arthralgia and myalgia related to SSc was made based on the clinical features along with radiological evidence from MRI scan.  The treatment approach consisted of an association of conservative techniques aimed at alleviating pain, improving muscle function, and restoring jaw movements. Initially,the patient received rest, reassurance, and jaw-opening exercises to manage painful joints.A myorelaxant medication was prescribed for a 10-day period to alleviate myofascial pain.Additionally,a 6-month physical therapy program comprising massage treatment on bilateral masseteric muscles,temporalis muscles exercises,and ultrasound therapy were recommended.Physiotherapy interventions were intended for managing musculoskeletal and myofacial pain as well as enhancing jaw movement.  Evaluation & Outcomes: Monthly reviews were conducted to monitor progress regarding reduction in pain intensity levelsand improvement in jaw movements.Follow-up after two months revealed substantial improvement including an increase in mouth opening capacity from 23mm to 33mm.In addition,pain associated with preauricular region dissipated gradually.Participation in physical therapy played a significant role leading to improved muscle flexibility; however,some residual rigidity remained due to SSc-induced skin fibrosis.  To stabilize the achieved results and provide additional support, a relaxant nocturnal occlusal appliance (commonly known as a night guard) was recommended.The patient reported satisfaction with this treatment modality, enabling sustained positive outcomes.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights the successful management of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) in a patient with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc). A multidisciplinary approach involving rest, reassurance, jaw-opening exercises, myorelaxants, and physical therapy resulted in improved pain control, increased jaw mobility,and better quality of life. Close monitoring and regular evaluations were essential components in achieving favorable outcomes for the patient. This case emphasizes the importance of tailored treatment strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration towards managing TMD in individuals with SSc.",explain
"Title: Neglected Ocular Trauma in a Preterm Infant: A Case Study  Introduction: This clinical case presents a unique and challenging scenario involving ocular trauma in an infant from a disadvantaged background. The patient, a preterm twin born to parents with limited education and resources, suffered severe injuries to the left eye. Despite financial constraints, the child received initial treatment and is currently undergoing follow-up care to address the potential long-term consequences of this neglected injury.  Patient Presentation: The patient, a female preterm infant, was found alone in her room after breastfeeding while her mother attended to domestic chores outside. Born as part of a polygamous family setting, she resides with siblings in crowded living conditions characterized by limited resources and inadequate hygiene. The mother reported rats freely navigating within and around their apartment before the incident.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination, it was evident that the child presented as acutely ill with significant damage to her left eyelids, nares (nostrils), cheek, and central cornea ulceration. Her weight was below average for her age group (1kg) - likely due to being born prematurely - but other systemic examinations did not reveal any additional abnormalities.  Medical Care Provided: After admission into the special baby care unit (SCBU), suitable measures were undertaken for wound management and infection prevention. To safeguard against tetanus infection, she received tetanus toxoid vaccination via subcutaneous injection along with intravenous antibiotics (Unasyn and Gentamicin) administered over multiple doses.  Additionally, supportive measures such as providing incubator care were initiated following recommendations made by the pediatrician overseeing her case. Feedings consisted of expressed breast milk given at calorie-rich quantities appropriate for an infant of this stage of development (120 kcal/kg/day).  Ophthalmological Intervention: With regard to eye-specific interventions for treating corneal ulcers resulting from rat bites on her face and damage-associated infections acquired soon after the injury, a plastic surgeon provided consultation. The ocular injury was cleaned daily with normal saline, and chloramphenicol ointment and artificial tear drops were administered to promote recovery.  Microbial Keratitis and Financial Constraints: Two weeks post-injury, the patient developed central microbial keratitis, a potentially debilitating complication that required prompt intervention. Unfortunately, the care giver declined referral to a corneal specialist due to financial constraints. Similarly, corneal scrapings for further analysis were also unaffordable.  Continued Management: Given the financial limitations of her care giver, the medical team procured lomefloxacin eye drops through voluntary donations from physicians. With timely administration of this medication coupled with regular follow-up appointments across ophthalmology, pediatrics, and plastic surgery departments, the child's condition improved - evident from resolved corneal ulcers and infiltrates.  Future Plans: The clinical team has emphasized to the care giver on multiple occasions about the critical need for penetrating keratoplasty (corneal grafting) along with reconstructive procedures for lid reconstruction in order to optimize visual outcomes as soon as possible. It is hoped that potential community support or access to charitable resources shall be explored extensively by healthcare providers ensuring optimal outcome in this neglected case.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights several key aspects - socioeconomic disparities influencing healthcare access and compliance issues in underserved populations. Despite limited resources available for comprehensive management options, medical interventions such as wound cleaning protocols and continuous administration of suitable antibiotics have helped stabilize the patient's ocular health. The commitment of healthcare professionals involved is vital in addressing cases characterized by vulnerable backgrounds while considering cost-effective approaches without compromising long-term visual rehabilitation goals",explain
"Title: Recurrent Plasmacytoma - A Challenging Case  Introduction: Plasmacytomas are rare tumors characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells in a localized area. Although they are typically found in the bone, extramedullary plasmacytomas can also occur in soft tissues. These tumors are classified as solitary if the patient presents with a single lesion or multiple when there is more than one tumor. We present a case of recurrent plasmacytoma with unusual clinical and histological features.  Initial Diagnosis and Treatment: The patient initially presented with an orchidectomy due to testicular mass suspicion. Pathological examination revealed a plasmocytoma characterized by infiltration of mature plasma cells, some plasmablasts, and positivity for CD138 and lambda chains while being negative for kappa chains and CD20. Further evaluation excluded multiple myeloma utilizing several diagnostic modalities including immunoelectrophoresis, whole body bone scan, urine tests for Bence Jones protein, and bone marrow biopsy.  First Recurrence: Sixteen months following orchidectomy, the patient developed a subcutaneous nodule at the right iliac fossa identified as recurrent plasmocytoma via cytology aspiration and cutaneous biopsy. Serum examination showed elevated levels of lambda light chains along with hypergammaglobulinemia IgA; however, no abnormalities were found on bone marrow aspiration.  Treatment Dilemma: Due to poor response after thalidomide-based chemotherapy (thalidomide plus dexamethasone), further investigations were carried out to determine disease extent. Thoraco-abdominal CT scans uncovered mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses consistent with recurrent plasmocytomas but skeletal surveys remained normal indicating no skeletal involvement.  Recurrent Plasmacytoma Management: Histological analysis confirmed similar morphology between initial testicular tumor and recurrences supporting the diagnosis of recurrent plasmacytoma. The patient was then started on polychemotherapy VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) but persistent retroperitoneal mass and the development of another skin lesion indicated a suboptimal response.  Alternative Treatment Approach: Subsequent treatment with CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone) showed promising results with a good response observed after three cycles. Follow-up CT scans revealed complete resolution of all masses and normalization of protein electrophoresis.  Long-term Monitoring: Given the frequency of recurrence and potential for transformation into multiple myeloma (MM), long-term follow-up is warranted to monitor disease progression. Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, regular evaluations are essential to detect any signs or symptoms indicative of a relapse.  Discussion: Recurrent plasmacytomas pose significant challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment due to their clinical heterogeneity. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive diagnostic investigations including laboratory tests, immunohistochemistry, cytology aspiration or biopsy for precise characterization and exclusion/detection of multiple myeloma.  Furthermore, it underscores the need for an individualized approach to therapy considering various factors such as disease extent/recurrence pattern, histological findings, previous treatment responses, and associated comorbidities. Collaboration among medical teams comprising hematologists/oncologists and radiation specialists plays a crucial role in ensuring optimal management strategies are implemented at each stage.  Conclusion: Recurrent plasmacytomas represent an intriguing clinical challenge due to their low incidence rates and varied presentation patterns. Continuous monitoring coupled with appropriate diagnostic assessments facilitates accurate staging while guiding therapeutic decisions tailored to each patient's unique circumstances. Further research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms contributing to recurrent tumors in order to enhance our understanding and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with this rare malignancy.",explain
"This clinical case involves a middle-aged woman who presented with vaginal bleeding and an abnormal mass protruding from her cervix. Let's break down the information provided and discuss the key points.  The patient, a G10P9018, has had nine normal deliveries and one spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. She has a history of breastfeeding for 18 months after giving birth to her last child, who is now 24 years old.   In terms of medical history, she was diagnosed with essential high blood pressure nine years ago and has been taking indapamide without experiencing any complications. She also underwent two eye surgeries for cataracts. It is mentioned that she has never received blood products and has no known allergies or habits such as alcohol or tobacco consumption.  On examination, there was a foul-smelling vaginal discharge noted but no signs of pelvic pain, coughing, chest pain, weight loss, anorexia or vomiting. Her general condition was good with a blood pressure reading of 140/88 mmHg. She had elevated weight (116 kg) with an increased body mass index (BMI) of 43.13 kg/m2.  Further examination revealed varicosities on both legs while cardiac, pulmonary, and breast examinations were normal except for an increased heart size visible on chest radiography without any pulmonary abnormalities detected.  Following this initial evaluation and physical examination findings suggestive of cervical pathology like necrotic hemorrhagic mass protruding from the cervix; further investigations were conducted to determine the extent of disease involvement: ultrasonography and CT scans showed that there was only cervical involvement without additional abnormalities in the abdomen or pelvis.  Laboratory tests including full blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), hemostasis workup were all within normal limits along with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results indicating no infection. Fasting blood glucose levels were also normal.  Based on the clinical and diagnostic findings, the working diagnosis was a stage II uterine leiomyosarcoma as per FIGO staging. To confirm the diagnosis, a total abdominal hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries) was performed under general anesthesia.  The surgery revealed that the uterus itself contained a seven-centimeter mass prolapsed through the cervix. The serosa layer of the uterus was invaded by tumor cells, but adnexae (fallopian tubes and ovaries) appeared macroscopically normal without any adhesions in the pelvis.  After surgery, there were complications with an infection developing in the abdominal wall, requiring drainage of an abscess and secondary closure 22 days later. The patient was then referred for adjuvant radiotherapy to further treat her condition.  The final histopathological analysis showed a neoplasm involving both malignant epithelial (mostly undifferentiated squamous carcinoma) and mesenchymal (homologous leiomyosarcoma) elements. This type of tumor is referred to as Mixed Malignant Müllerian Tumor or Carcinosarcoma of corpus uteri with pathological stage PT3.  In summary, this clinical case describes a middle-aged woman who presented with vaginal bleeding associated with a necrotic hemorrhagic mass protruding from her cervix. Further investigations confirmed the presence of uterine leiomyosarcoma along with squamous carcinoma components. Treatment involved surgical removal followed by radiotherapy due to postoperative complications arising from an abdominal wall infection",explain
"Clinical Case: Management of Ventricular Tachycardia in a Pregnant Patient  In this case, we encounter a pregnant patient with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) who requires medical and interventional management. Initially, the patient was treated with Cordarone (amiodarone), an antiarrhythmic medication commonly used for VT. However, due to the persistence of VT and the occurrence of secondary hyperthyroidism, the treatment was switched to flecainide.  Despite this change in medication, the patient experiences recurring episodes of VT. To address this, hyperten (a beta blocker) is added to her treatment regimen. However, as the recurrent VT persists despite medical therapy and poses a significant risk to both mother and fetus, radiofrequency ablation is indicated.  The first attempt at radiofrequency ablation is complicated by VT with ST elevation and an increase in troponin levels. To rule out any underlying coronary artery disease as a cause for these complications, a coronary angiography is performed which comes back normal.  A second attempt at radiofrequency ablation is successfully carried out later that year. During this time, the patient continues her treatment with Detensiel (an antihypertensive), flecainide (antiarrhythmic), and Aspégic (aspirin). Following successful intervention without further VT occurrences during pregnancy, she remains stable throughout her pregnancy without experiencing ventricular arrhythmias.  At 34 weeks of gestation when it becomes necessary to plan for delivery due to concerns about maternal cardiac function and possible arrhythmias during labor or postpartum period; preoperative evaluation reveals normal somatic examination results but shows signs suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy on chest radiography along with right bundle branch block on ECG beyond V1 leads.  Further evaluation through transthoracic echocardiogram confirms dilated right ventricle and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. Blood tests, including complete blood count, prothrombin ratio, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, come back normal.  In preparation for the cesarean section delivery scheduled at 38 weeks of pregnancy, the patient undergoes preoperative fasting for six hours and continues her medication regimen until the day of surgery. The potential risks associated with bleeding, transfusion requirements, and perioperative cardiac rhythm disturbances are explained to the patient during consultation. Anesthetic techniques involving general anesthesia along with postoperative pain management using titration of morphine are also discussed.  On the day of surgery, standard monitoring is initiated including ECG, oxygen saturation (pSO2), non-invasive blood pressure measurement, and capnography. Two peripheral venous lines are established using an 18G needle. The patient is placed in a left lateral decubitus position. Intravenous administration of 500 mL Ringer lactate over 30 minutes is prescribed to maintain hydration.  Preoxygenation is performed three minutes before anesthesia induction. Anesthetic induction occurs after draping with propofol (3 mg/kg), remifentanil (1 μg/kg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) while applying Sellick maneuver to prevent regurgitation during intubation. A size 7Fr tube is used for endotracheal intubation.  Anesthesia maintenance is achieved through continuous infusion of propofol (10 mg/kg/hour) and remifentanil (0.1 mcg/kg/minute). Following fetal extraction during surgery, prophylactic antibiotic therapy with cefazolin (2 g) is administered intravenously while oxytocin given as an injection at a dose of 5 IU followed by infusion at a dosage rate equivalent to that diluted in saline solution.  Throughout the surgery, hemodynamic stability is maintained, ensuring systolic blood pressure of 110-100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 60-50 mm Hg, and heart rate between 60 and 70 beats per minute. Respiratory parameters such as oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO2 are closely monitored to maintain optimal ventilation.  Extubation is successfully performed on the operating table without any immediate complications. The postoperative period remains uneventful with no changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) findings or evidence of bleeding. Adequate postoperative analgesia is achieved through administration of paracetamol (15 mg/kg/6 hours) and morphine (5 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours).  Following a three-day hospital stay after delivery, breastfeeding is contraindicated due to the medications administered during this period. The patient's stable clinical condition as well as absence of any cardiac rhythm disturbances allows for a successful outcome.  In conclusion, this case highlights the complex management involved in treating a pregnant patient with ventricular tachycardia. It necessitates careful consideration regarding antiarrhythmic medications to control arrhythmias while minimizing risks to both mother and fetus. Close monitoring during surgery along with appropriate anesthesia protocols ensures safe delivery while managing potential complications associated with ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy",explain
"In this clinical case, we are presented with a young white man who initially had no history of addiction or alcohol consumption. His cognitive function assessment was normal, but genetic studies were not available due to limited techniques in Tunisia.  The patient was described as emotionally cold, with an increased interest in studies compared to leisure activities. Two years ago, the patient suddenly developed soliloquy (talking to oneself), verbal aggressiveness towards his parents, persecution delusions, mystical talk, and sleep disturbance.  Upon physical examination, the patient was found to be moving in a wheelchair due to functional impairment secondary to the severity of extrapyramidal syndrome affecting his limbs. However, his consciousness was clear without any confusion. Neurological examination revealed rotatory nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and dystonia (abnormal muscle tone) of the hands and feet.  Psychiatric examination showed that the patient had difficulty maintaining good contact but appeared anxious and suspicious. His speech was poor in content and barely understandable due to dysarthria (speech disorder). He reported a fuzzy and non-systematized delusion: believing that he was the prophet ""Noah"" charged with a divine mission to change the world functioning. He also believed he was persecuted by strangers collaborating with his parents who wanted him dead. The patient experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.  MRI findings showed signal abnormalities in the central gray nucleus or basal ganglia similar to those observed five years earlier. Routine blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), blood sedimentation reaction (BSR), liver and renal function assessments, serum electrolytes were all normal. An electroencephalogram also showed no abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and blood lactate levels were within normal ranges.  The treatment plan began with prescribing amisulpiride in small doses combined with a benzodiazepine for anxiety control and biperiden hydrochloride as a corrector of extrapyramidal effects. Higher doses of antipsychotics were not well-tolerated due to significant side effects, leading to a switch to aripiprazole gradually.  With the use of aripiprazole, the patient showed improvement and was well-tolerated without any neurological deterioration. As there were still persistent positive symptoms, anxiety, and behavioral corollaries such as distrust of his parents, refusal of food prepared by them, and insomnia; valproic acid and clonazepam were added after 6 weeks of treatment.  Although the clinical improvement was only partial after 6 months of treatment with this combination, it allowed for acceptable interfamily adaptation. Another switch in medication was made to olanzapine while maintaining valproic acid and clonazepam. This new combination resulted in partial remission and continued maintenance.  It is interesting to note that clozapine has not been tried in this case. Clozapine is often considered when other antipsychotic medications fail or are poorly tolerated by patients. It may be an option worth considering if the current treatment regimen does not yield satisfactory results.  In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a young man presenting with delusions, hallucinations, extrapyramidal symptoms (as seen through movement impairment), cognitive functioning within normal range but genetic testing unattainable due to limited techniques available locally (in Tunisia). The patient showed partial remission with different medication switches over time but remained partially symptomatic even after six months of treatment.",explain
"This clinical case involves a child who was previously diagnosed with a genetic and hematologic condition. The child attends a special school for the blind and has been very successful, showing independence in everyday living and having normal intellectual capabilities. In February 2012, the child presented to the hospital with an intertrochanteric fracture of her left femur following a trauma.  Upon admission, the child's general status was impaired and she was unable to ambulate, requiring the use of a wheelchair. She had a plaster splint on her left lower limb and exhibited tachycardia (heart rate up to 140 beats per minute) with blood pressure at 100/65 mmHg. Physical examination revealed an enlarged liver palpated below the ribs and an enlarged spleen at umbilical level, both of which had abnormal consistency.  No signs of increased pressure within the skull or irritation of nerves stemming from the meninges were detected. However, attempts at passive movement in the left hip joint elicited extreme pain for the patient. X-rays confirmed an intertrochanteric fracture with slight deformity and indicated features consistent with her underlying genetic condition - diffuse sclerosis without differentiation between cortical (outer) and spongy bone affecting various bones throughout her body.  Hematologic investigations conducted prior to surgery revealed severe anemia (low hemoglobin levels), decreased platelet count, low fibrinogen levels (a clotting protein), but no other abnormalities related to blood disorders were present.  To prepare for surgery, replacement therapy was administered including erythrocyte concentrate (red blood cells), plasma, and platelet concentrate under sterile reanimation conditions. On February 20th, 2012, surgical treatment commenced with suitable hemoglobin levels restored through transfusion therapy.  The surgical technique employed involved open reduction (realignment) of the femoral fracture followed by fixation using a stable metal osteosynthesis procedure utilizing plates designed specifically for pediatric patients. Due to the hardness of the patient's bones, the surgical team encountered difficulties during plate application, necessitating the use of a specialized drill with low speed and high torque and frequently changing original steel drill bits.  The operation lasted 2 hours and 25 minutes with minimal blood loss. However, additional fissures in the femoral neck were discovered on postoperative X-rays due to complications arising from drilling holes for screw placement. Despite these fissures, there was no compromise in stability or subsequent bone healing.  In the early postoperative period, standard antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to prevent infection. Physical therapy commenced on the first day after surgery with active movement exercises. Over time, guided walking using a stable walker was introduced as part of a customized physiotherapy program adapted specifically for blind patients.  Treatment also included ongoing hematologic substitution therapy provided by a pediatric hematologist to manage any associated aplastic anemia (a decrease in red blood cell production). After three months post-surgery, education in crutch walking began through further sessions of physiotherapy.  By six months post-surgery (March 2013), X-rays displayed consolidation of the fracture along with normal alignment between the femoral neck and shaft. The child experienced minimal leg length discrepancy (<0.5 cm) and had improved range of motion in her operated hip joint - 90° active flexion, 5° extension, and 30° abduction without pain.  With substantial progress on her gait improvement journey, she returned to her specialized school for blind students at appropriate grade level after completion of one year follow-up from surgery.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with severe hypertension and haematospermia (blood in semen).  The patient's history reveals several important factors. He had been intermittently taking oral sildenafil, a medication used to enhance sexual performance, for the past two years. He also had a positive history of unprotected sexual intercourse with both his current and previous girlfriends. Additionally, his father and elder sister were known hypertensives, suggesting a possible family history of high blood pressure.  On examination, the patient did not exhibit any signs of respiratory distress or pain. There were no obvious physical abnormalities such as pale skin, jaundice, or edema. However, the blood pressure reading was significantly elevated at 200/120 mmHg and there was an abnormal sound heard when listening to the heart (heaving apex beat). This indicates that the patient's hypertension is severe enough to cause cardiac complications.  Laboratory investigations revealed an increased urea level and elevated creatinine indicating impaired kidney function. His lipid profile showed mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels while other lipid parameters were normal. The full blood count indicated a lower than normal hematocrit level but other parameters were within normal range.  Immunological testing ruled out HIV or tuberculosis infection as potential causes for his symptoms. Urine analysis showed trace glycosuria (sugar in urine) but no protein or blood present. There was also no significant bacterial growth on urine culture.  The analysis of the seminal fluid revealed brownish gelatinous fluid with numerous red blood cells present along with pus cells indicating inflammation in the semen. The spermatozoa count was low at 10.2 x 10^6 ml and only 30% of them appeared actively motile while 60% were non-motile.  Due to financial constraints, further imaging tests such as renal ultrasound scan, echocardiogram, prostate scan, and prostate-specific antigen test were not performed.  Treatment for the patient focused on managing his severe hypertension, counseling him on lifestyle modifications, and implementing a DASH (dietary approach to stop hypertension) diet. Medications used included oral nifedipine control release tablets, moduretic tablets, and lisinopril. Gradual reduction of blood pressure occurred over several days. By the time of discharge after two weeks, the patient's blood pressure had improved to 150/100 mm Hg.  During follow-up visits, the patient reported lower blood pressure readings outside of the hospital setting. He also faced social challenges as his sexual partners became scared and avoided him due to his haematospermia.  Although the haematospermia resolved completely after being on regular antihypertensive medications for some weeks, it is mentioned that he was lost to follow-up. The last known information is that he suffered a stroke while seeking further treatment at a church.  This case highlights several significant issues. Firstly, there is a strong association between severe hypertension and urological symptoms such as haematospermia in this patient. Secondly, inadequate management of hypertension can lead to serious complications such as stroke. Lastly, there may be barriers in healthcare access or belief systems that can hinder proper medical management when individuals seek alternative treatments.  In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis and management of severe hypertension for preventing potentially life-threatening complications like stroke. It also emphasizes the need for appropriate communication regarding expectations and potential side effects related to medications such as sildenafil which are commonly used without medical supervision.",explain
"Case Presentation: Mandibular Angle Fracture  In this clinical case, we have a 21-year-old male who suffered an isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. The patient expressed a desire for an early return to work, and upon further investigation using a CT scan, a torsional deformation was observed on the fracture fragments. As a result, the decision was made to perform an open reduction.  The surgical procedure for this patient took place under general anesthesia. Induction was accomplished using thiopentone sodium, and nasotracheal intubation was performed to secure the airway. To achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and proper occlusion during surgery, the oral cavity had to be kept free from obstruction.  Maintenance of anesthesia during the procedure involved the use of isoflurane and/or sevoflurane gases. Prior to commencing the surgery, the surgical site and incision line were marked with marking ink for reference. Local anesthesia containing lidocaine with adrenaline in 1:1000 concentrations was then infiltrated along these marked lines.  The incision itself is crucial in this approach as aesthetic considerations are given prime importance when designing this surgical access point. Care must be taken to ensure that the incision follows accurately along the curvature of the angle of the mandible. Additionally, it is important that suture lines are visualized beforehand so that they can be completely hidden within shadows caused by anatomical landmarks.  In terms of technique, it appears that a combination of postramal Hind's incision and submandibular Risdon's incision was used for this case. However, due to its proximity to the angle of the mandible (around 1 cm away), it can be considered distinct from either standard approach or perhaps as their modification specific for close proximity fractures at mandible angle.  To achieve clean and precise results when making incisions, a sharp blade with a number 15 edge is imperative to avoid any jaggedness along the incision line. The initial stroke should only expose the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with tight control achieved using skin hooks that hold the surrounding tissue away. This technique provides a clear view of the underlying subcutaneous structures.  Dissecting through the platysma muscle is typically straightforward and can be accomplished using scissors or a scalpel blade. During this step, it is important to be cautious not to disturb the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia which lies beneath. Attention then turns toward dissecting through this deep fascia, which can prove challenging due to its proximity to vital structures such as facial nerves and blood vessels.  Upon incising the deep fascia, locating and identifying the facial nerve becomes crucial. Techniques such as nerve stimulation may aid in properly identifying and retracting this delicate nerve within the upper flap of tissue for protection during further steps of surgery. Additionally, care must be taken when locating and handling facial artery and vein if necessary.  Once these nerves have been addressed appropriately in terms of protection or ligation if necessary, attention shifts towards exposing the pterygo-masseteric sling beneath them. Once identified, a precise incision on this sling allows for optimal visualization at mandibular angle level — this particular plane is relatively avascular with minimal bleeding associated.  With clear exposure achieved at the mandibular angle, fracture fragments can be easily manipulated back into proper alignment for reduction purposes. The next step involves placing miniplates followed by successful fixation techniques based on surgical expertise regarding anatomical considerations.  Throughout surgery irrigation ensures clean working field continuously keeping visibility maintained followed by closure achieved in layers emphasizing delineation between different anatomical spaces encountered during access phase including reapproximation of subcutaneous tissues that reflects very well planned surgical approach resulting into excellent post-operative scar leaving no suture tracks seen within conversational distance.",explain
"Case 1: In this clinical case, the patient presented with a lesion in the right mandibular crest that had been evolving for one month. The neurological examination revealed a decreased sensation in the lower lip and chin on the same side, indicating possible nerve involvement suggestive of malignancy. Further imaging using craniofacial CT scan showed infiltration of the soft tissues around the right mandible along with an osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest near tooth number 45. Additionally, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found bilaterally, including submandibular, supraclavicular, and jugulo-carotid lymph nodes. The largest lymph node measured 20 mm.  A biopsy of the lesion was performed and histological analysis led to the conclusion that it was a large B-cell lymphoma originating from the gingiva of the mandible. The tumor cells exhibited clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear atypia. Numerous mitoses (cell divisions) and apoptotic bodies (cell death indicators) were observed within the tumor tissue. There were also significant necrotic changes present.  Immunohistochemical examination further confirmed its nature as a large B-cell lymphoma by demonstrating strong and diffuse expression of CD45 and CD20 markers on tumor cells while ruling out expression of CD3 and CK markers.  Given these findings, it was determined that chemotherapy would be an appropriate treatment approach for this patient's large B-cell lymphoma. Following initiation of chemotherapy cycles, there was a noticeable improvement in her condition.  Case 2: The second case involves a 16-year-old male patient who initially presented with acute articular rheumatism but later experienced worsening general health status leading to hospitalization in General Surgery Department. Initially presenting symptoms included epigastralgia (abdominal pain located near upper stomach), vomiting, influenza-like illness accompanied by symptomatic relief measures.  Subsequently, he developed progressive pain localized to the right lower abdomen, diarrhea-like transit disorders, and a left mandibular swelling suspected to be of dental origin. Clinical examination revealed palpable left cervical lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes in the neck) without limitations in mouth opening. Intraoral examination displayed an extensive gingival mass extending from teeth 34 to 37 and mobility of the involved teeth for about three weeks.  Neurological evaluation demonstrated a hypoaesthesia (decreased sensation) along the path of the left inferior alveolar nerve. Radiological assessment revealed bone destruction affecting furcations (areas where tooth roots diverge) of teeth on the left side of molar region. Furthermore, an abdominal CT scan showed a tumor mass at ileocecal junction as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis (spread of cancerous cells within the abdominal cavity) and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with one measuring 31*21mm.  Biological analysis indicated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker indicating inflammation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which suggests tissue damage. HIV serology results were negative.  Given these findings, an association between oral lesion and abdominal tumor was suspected, raising concerns about cancer potentially originating from lymphocytes. A biopsy was performed on the oral lesion while surgical intervention occurred for removal of abdominal tumor by general surgery department.  Histopathological examinations confirmed Burkitt lymphoma as diagnosis with primary location in abdomen and secondary involvement in oral cavity. Microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse proliferation pattern consisting predominantly small to medium-sized basophilic cytoplasm lymphocytes with numerous mitoses observed under high magnification imaging. Immunohistochemistry supported this finding by demonstrating CD20 (+), CD10 (+), heterogeneous Bcl6 expression on B-lymphocytes. Furthermore, Ki67 staining indicated highly proliferative nature with all Ki67-positive cells demonstrating active cell division.  Upon completion of surgery and following oncology guidelines, the patient was referred to onco-hematology department for initiation of chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, the patient passed away one month later.  Both cases highlight the importance of prompt identification and management of malignancies arising from oral tissues. In both instances, a multidisciplinary approach involving dental professionals, surgeons, pathologists, and oncologists was crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with truncal obesity, gynecomastia, early bilateral knee osteoarthritis, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient had a history of heavy alcohol consumption for 40 years but had stopped drinking 6 years prior to the onset of his symptoms. He also stopped attending social gatherings. During routine investigation, the patient opened up to a radiologist about his concerns and was then referred to the plastic surgery clinic.  Upon examination, the patient was found to be an elderly man who appeared obese but in no obvious distress. He had a moody affect and weighed 123 kg with a height of 1.8 meters, resulting in a BMI of 38 kg/m2. His waist circumference was significantly increased at 145 cm compared to the normal measurement for males which is around 102 cm.  Musculo-skeletal examination revealed bilateral knee tenderness without swelling or crepitus. The patient also had bilateral gynecomastia and lipoma on his right thigh. Based on these findings along with his medical history of hypertension and diabetes, a diagnosis of truncal obesity in an elderly man with associated comorbidities was made.  Further investigations were performed including ultrasound imaging of the abdominal wall which showed variable thickness ranging from 7-10 cm in the upper quadrants and about 14-20 cm in the lower quadrants along with sonologically significant intra-abdominal fat deposition. No organ pathology was observed through these tests.  Laboratory investigations such as serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine levels, fasting blood sugar level analysis, complete blood count assessment, serum protein analysis, serum lipid profile evaluation as well as an echocardiography were all within normal ranges.  Following consultation with both a cardiologist and anesthesiologist who independently confirmed him fit for surgery after their respective assessments; informed consent from the patient was obtained for abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) surgery, potentially combined with liposuction. However, liposuction was later excluded due to concerns regarding the patient's age and co-existing health conditions.  The surgical procedure involved general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation after failed epidural anesthesia. Approximately 1.7 liters of Hunstad fluid were also infused for hemostasis (control of bleeding) and hydro-dissection (separation of tissues). The conventional abdominoplasty technique was used, making a traditional incision in the lower abdomen and excising the protruding infra-umbilical tissue which weighed around 8.4 kg.  Additionally, the rectus sheath (a layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the rectus abdominis muscles) was plicated (tightened) in two rows, allowing for a flatter abdominal appearance. The patient's umbilicus was also transposed to its new position on the tightened abdominal wall before closing the surgical wound using sutures over two redivac drains, which are placed to remove excess fluid post-operatively.  During surgery, there was an estimated blood loss of 750 ml and the patient received a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells as required. Post-operative complications included a blood transfusion reaction and surgical site infection resulting in partial wound dehiscence (separation).  However, these complications were successfully managed through wound dressings using povidone iodine solution and antibiotics ultimately leading to their resolution. The patient experienced significant improvement in his quality of life following surgery including returning to his business ventures and social activities that had previously been limited by his physical appearance.  One year after abdominoplasty, it was noted that he weighed 116 kg with a BMI decrease to 35.8 kg/m2. Waist girth decreased to 112 cm compared to pre-operative measurements while abdominal girth at umbilical level decreased considerably from 141 cm to 123 cm. The point of maximal enlargement was reduced significantly as well from 151 cm located at 20 cm below the umbilicus pre-operatively to only 125 cm located just 10 cm below the umbilicus post-operatively.  A post-operative ultrasound of the abdominal wall demonstrated a reduced and more uniform thickness ranging from 1.3-4.4 cm, indicating successful surgical outcome in terms of removal of excess adipose tissue and improvement in abdominal contour.  The patient was advised to continue abstinence from alcohol consumption along with dietary control measures for long-term health benefits and weight management. ",explain
"This clinical case involves a patient who underwent a soft tissue reconstruction surgery of the right upper limb with tendon transfer. The aim of the surgery was to improve the patient's strength and alleviate their symptoms. Specifically, the tendons of flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus were harvested and attached to tendons of extensor digitorum communis and extensor pollicis longus respectively.  Following the surgery, the patient's right forearm was placed in a plaster cast for a period of 3 weeks. Once the plaster cast was removed, the patient visited the physical therapy department for rehabilitation. However, they experienced pain over their wrist joint and difficulty in holding objects between their thumb and fingers on their right hand.  The pain reported by the patient was described as a dull ache, along with tingling sensations over their distal forearm. They also experienced numbness and paraesthesia in their palm, with a numerical pain rating scale indicating moderate pain (6/10). A scar was noticed on both dorsal (back) and volar (palm-side) aspects of the distal forearm.  Table 1 represents range-of-motion measurements taken during physical examinations. The examination also included testing muscle strength in various areas such as elbow flexors/extensors, wrist flexors/extensors, thumb flexors/extensors using medical research council grading system (1/5 indicating severe impairment to 5/5 representing normal strength). Overall muscle strength appeared to be lower than optimal.  Despite these challenges faced by the patient during rehab sessions initially, superficial and deep sensations were intact throughout his upper limb.  Rehabilitation spanned four weeks with each week focusing on different interventions. During week one, treatment included electrical stimulation using faradism under pressure for visible contractions while performing passive movements involving wrist joint mobility exercises performed for ten repetitions each session along with scar immobilization incorporating stretching techniques lasting two hours per session daily.  In week two, ultrasound with a 3 MHZ frequency was used for seven minutes followed by hot fomentation to optimize the range of motion in the wrist joint. Wrist and finger extensors were stimulated using intermediate galvanic current during passive movements to enhance muscle re-education.  The therapy protocol for week three introduced resistance training exercises targeting wrist flexors/extensors, forearm supinators/pronators involving resistance devices. These exercises required a 3-second hold and 15 repetitions per session. Additionally, various objects were utilized to help improve grip function.  On the first day of week four, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) parameters shifted to faradic current for re-education purposes. Strengthening exercises continued with progressive increments in intensity and duration based on clinical improvements observed throughout recent sessions.  At the end of the rehabilitation period (day 28), significant improvements were noted across several measures: pain intensity decreased (NPRS score reduced from 6/10 initially to 2/10), muscle strength improved (graded as 3+/5), range of motion results became more favorable compared to baseline measurements outlined in Table 1. The patient-specific functional scale score also rose from initial baseline value of 2/10 to a final score of 7/10 indicating improved functional outcome after rehabilitation intervention.  Furthermore, evaluation through strength-duration curve testing indicated restored innervation status post-rehabilitation.  In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates a patient's journey through soft tissue reconstruction surgery followed by a comprehensive rehabilitation program that incorporated various modalities ranging from electrical stimulation techniques like faradism under pressure and EMS, along with specific therapeutic exercises targeted towards improving strength and functionality within their right upper limb. The individual experienced significant improvements across multiple areas following structured physical therapy interventions over four weeks post-surgery.",explain
"This clinical case presents the story of a young patient who experienced neurological symptoms and was later diagnosed with Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS). The patient had no previous trauma to the head or history of drug ingestion and his haemoglobin genotype was unknown.  The initial presentation led to suspicion of a stroke, and the patient was admitted to a private hospital where he received subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for two days. Although there was initially some improvement in his clinical state, it later deteriorated, leading to referral to a Federal Medical Centre.  Upon admission at the Federal Medical Centre, general physical examination findings were normal except for specific neurological symptoms. The patient displayed expressive aphasia, right-sided facial weakness, hypertonia in both upper and lower limbs, and weakness of the limbs on both sides. There were also signs of hyperreflexia bilaterally in both upper and lower limbs, absent abdominal reflexes, sustained ankle clonus, positive Babinski sign bilaterally, and signs of incoordination (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia).  Given these findings along with other system examinations that appeared normal at that time, an initial diagnosis of encephalopathy secondary to encephalitis was made. However differential diagnoses such as space-occupying lesion with raised intracranial pressure (RICP) and sickle cell CNS infarctive crisis were considered.  To confirm or rule out these diagnoses further investigations were carried out including tests for haemoglobin genotype; Full Blood Count (FBC); Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR); Random Blood Sugar (RBS); Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS); blood film for Malaria Parasite (MP); Serum Electrolytes Urea & Creatinine; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain; Clotting profile with Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).  The MRI brain revealed multiple areas of subacute cerebral infarction in the parietal and occipital regions. Considering the patient's clinical features and MRI findings, the diagnosis was modified to Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).  Treatment for PACNS involves a combination of medications including immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. In this case, the patient initially received intravenous dexamethasone along with intravenous fluids due to vomiting on admission. With subsiding symptoms, oral feeds were initiated, and tablets prednisolone were administered twice daily.  As part of supportive care while awaiting further investigation results such as FBC, an intravenous antibiotic (Ceftriaxone) was administered along with an antihelminthic medication (Albendazole). Physiotherapy was also instituted to aid in motor function improvement.  Over time, there was a notable improvement in the patient's condition. Speech became audible though poorly fluent, power increased in both sides but with subtle right-sided facial weakness remaining. Signs of incoordination persisted but there was steady improvement overall.  Treatment approach was then modified by reducing prednisolone dosage to alternate days while adding cyclophosphamide to synchronize with steroid-off days for long-term therapy. The patient and his mother were counseled about the nature of the diagnosis, prolonged therapy requirement, possible residual deficits, and explained that continued physiotherapy and occupational therapy would be necessary.  During follow-up visits at weekly intervals (weeks 5-9), steady improvement continued with normal power returning grossly to limbs; fine motor function improved along with resolution of facial weakness, expressive aphasia, and signs of upper motor neuron lesion. However increased appetite weight gain (with ""moon face"") persisted along with signs of incoordination.  As recovery progressed further tapering down prednisolone doses occurred from 10mg to 4mg to 2mg on alternate days. By the 12th week following diagnosis, signs of incoordination disappeared and the patient became completely neurologically normal. The medications were eventually stopped after three months, and a repeat MRI was planned.  However, due to financial constraints, reimaging was delayed. The patient was seen again seven months later and by then all signs of incoordination had disappeared. A repeat brain MRI conducted at this time showed marked improvement with complete resolution of certain cortical lesions in the parietal and occipital regions bilaterally.  In summary, this clinical case highlights the journey of a patient with an initial suspicion of stroke but later diagnosed with Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS). Through appropriate treatment including immunosuppressive therapy and corticosteroids as well as supportive care like physiotherapy, the patient showed significant improvement over time with complete resolution of symptoms nearly one year after admission.",explain
"This clinical case presents a complex medical journey of a patient with severe lung involvement and multiple diagnostic challenges. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathies, suggesting an inflammatory lung condition. However, all microbiological investigations for infectious causes, including tuberculosis, were negative.  A notable finding in this case was the patient's hypergammaglobulinemia, indicating an abnormal increase in immunoglobulin levels. Other immunological tests were negative, ruling out certain autoimmune conditions. Transthoracic echocardiography showed hyperkinetic left ventricle and mild dilation of the right ventricle with elevated pulmonary arterial pressures (PAPs), indicating potential heart involvement.  Further investigations included bronchial endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The endoscopy revealed inflammation in the bronchial tree, while BAL indicated lymphocytic alveolitis characterized by an imbalance in CD4 (helper T cells) over CD8 (suppressor T cells) ratio. These findings hinted at possible interstitial lung diseases.  Considering the severity of lung involvement and high endemicity of tuberculosis in their country, despite negative microbiological findings for tuberculosis initially, the medical team decided to begin a trial anti-tuberculosis treatment. Unfortunately, after two weeks of treatment initiation, the patient developed an allergic skin reaction necessitating treatment discontinuation.  Corticosteroids were then initiated due to idiopathic diffuse infiltrating pneumonitis; however, there was no improvement observed over time. Subsequent chest scans revealed worsening interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis progression within 27 days of treatment initiation.  To obtain a definitive diagnosis or identify potential risk factors contributing to the condition, open lung biopsy was performed. The histological examination showed extensive damage to the lung parenchyma with mutilating fibrosis containing inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils. Epithelioid and giant cell granulomas were present without necrosis.  Based on the observed features, a diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) associated with sarcoidosis or berylliosis with acute exacerbation was retained. Since sarcoidosis seemed less likely given the CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL, attention turned to investigating risk factors for chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The patient's occupational history as a glassblower in an artistic glass factory for six months raised suspicion of exposure to beryllium.  Occupational department experts confirmed the presence of beryllium in colored glass compounds at the workplace, confirming CBD as the cause. Steroids were continued while oxygen requirement gradually decreased. The patient was discharged after 55 days with long-term oxygen therapy.  Over time, pulmonary function tests showed severe restrictive impairment; however, slight improvements were noted one year after discharge with partial regression of lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities detected through CT scan. An aspergilloma within a cavity was observed during imaging.  Two years after CBD diagnosis, the patient unfortunately experienced acute respiratory failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). An enhanced CT scan revealed further deterioration of pulmonary parenchyma along with pulmonary embolism ultimately leading to a fatal outcome.  In summary, this clinical case demonstrates diagnostic challenges posed by rare conditions such as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and highlights how occupational history plays a crucial role in identifying potential causes. Despite interventions including anti-tuberculosis treatment and corticosteroids, substantial lung damage occurred leading to progressive fibrosis and eventually fatal complications.",explain
"This clinical case describes a pregnant patient who presented with severe symptoms and complications related to high blood pressure (hypertension) and liver dysfunction. The initial presentation included a blood pressure reading of 180/110 mmHg, positive findings on obstetric ultrasound indicating a healthy fetal heart rhythm, and abnormal laboratory results such as significant proteinuria (4+), elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), along with other abnormalities including platelet count, bilirubin levels, and hemoglobin levels.  To address the hypertensive crisis, the medical team administered antihypertensive medications: intravenous nicardipine as a bolus dose and oral methyldopa every 8 hours. In addition to controlling the blood pressure, magnesium sulfate was given to prevent seizures in this patient. As there was also concern for premature delivery of the baby due to the complications observed in both mother and fetus, betamethasone was administered to enhance fetal lung maturity.  Despite these interventions targeting symptomatic relief for both mother and baby, it became evident that they were ineffective in stabilizing the patient's condition. Thus an immediate cesarean delivery was deemed necessary for maternal rescue.  Post-delivery complications emerged rapidly within two days after birth. The patient experienced intense epigastric pain accompanied by several abnormal laboratory findings indicating organ damage including severe anemia (hemoglobin dropped to 9.1 g/dl), further elevation of liver enzymes (AST & ALT), decreased platelet count suggestive of thrombocytopenia, raised LDH levels indicative of tissue breakdown or damage, prolonged prothrombin time suggesting impaired clotting ability along with elevated renal markers like serum creatinine reflecting kidney dysfunction.  Based on these observations combined with previous findings from pregnancy-specific tests such as proteinuria and deranged liver function tests during pregnancy-induced hypertension assessments initially performed outside MICU care suggests that this patient likely developed HELLP syndrome - Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count.  As a result of this diagnosis, the patient was promptly transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for possible liver subcapsular hematoma related to HELLP syndrome. In MICU, further examination revealed right hypochondrial sensitivity and decreased breath sounds on physical examination. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated hyperechoic areas within different hepatic segments along with extensive hydrothorax.  To provide a comprehensive picture of the situation and identify potential complications, a thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan was performed. This scan revealed diffuse poorly defined hypodense plaques distributed throughout all liver segments with no signs of hemorrhage within those areas or increased portal or subhepatic vascular permeability. The CT findings were consistent with massive hepatic infarction. Furthermore, intra-peritoneal and pleural effusions were also observed during the CT scan.  The treatment approach continued by administering antihypertensive drugs orally along with prophylactic anticoagulants and proton pump inhibitors to manage blood pressure control, prevent clot formation in risk areas like blood vessels within damaged liver tissue while reducing gastric acid production respectively.  Unfortunately, complications persisted as the patient developed respiratory distress evidenced by worsening pleural effusion on chest X-ray along with fever and deteriorating laboratory results including severe anemia (hemoglobin = 4.6 g/dl), platelet levels dropping even lower (20000/ul), elevated white blood cell count indicative of infection (26000/ul), increased C-reactive protein as an inflammation marker reaching 340 mg/l), decreased albumin reflecting poor nutritional status (16 g/l), prolonged PT reflecting impaired clotting ability(50%).  Treatment at this stage incorporated administration of antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam combination therapy for a period of two weeks and amikacin for three days additionally providing supportive measures, such as red blood cell and platelet transfusions, albumin infusions, and pleural effusion drainage.  Over the subsequent six days in MICU care, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement. Liver function tests began to show a downtrend by postoperative day 5. Over time, all laboratory abnormalities gradually normalized within 11 days. The CT scan performed to monitor hepatic areas showed stable findings after 15 days.  Eventually, on day 17 of her hospitalization journey, the patient was deemed stable enough for discharge with scheduled follow-ups to further assess her ongoing recovery process.",explain
"This clinical case describes the unfortunate and complex health journey of a newborn baby who ultimately succumbed to septic shock and multiple organ failure. The case highlights the importance of proper clinical management, early diagnosis, and timely intervention in neonatal patients.  The story starts with the baby being born without any apparent symptoms during his time in the hospital. However, shortly after being taken home, he started to experience multiple yellowish-watery stools (around 12 times) and refused to feed. Initially, there was no fever or vomiting observed.  Further examination revealed signs of severe dehydration but no distention or tenderness in the abdomen. Laboratory findings showed hypernatremia (abnormally high sodium levels), hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), and severe metabolic acidosis – characterized by low blood pH and bicarbonate levels. The osmotic gap was also increased at 45 points, indicating an imbalance between ions in bodily fluids.  To identify whether an infectious agent was responsible for these symptoms, blood and stool cultures were obtained with subsequent administration of intravenous fluids, electrolytes, and antibiotics.  After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved; however physiological problems continued to develop including acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia. A chest radiograph showed a ""bat wings"" pattern on imaging along with an increased cardiothoracic index of 0.45 suggesting potential cardiopulmonary involvement.  A renal ultrasound revealed mildly brighter kidneys cortex without any structural malformations indicative of inherent kidney abnormalities.  Given these ongoing complications, the baby's care needed to be escalated further – he was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit where he required mechanical ventilation for three days along with receiving parenteral feeding through a central catheter due to difficulty tolerating enteral feedings via hydrolyzed milk formula.  Unfortunately as his hospital stay continued lengthening due partly by cholestasis as well as a staphylococcus epidermidis infection.  Throughout the course of his admission, he developed slimy diarrhea, making attempts to introduce enteral feeding challenging. Eventually, an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy were performed which showed partial villous atrophy (a condition where the lining of the intestines becomes damaged) with brush border abnormalities.  Staining with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) revealed further abnormalities including loss of the linear part of enterocytes (intestinal cells) along with intra-cytoplasmic PAS+ bands in the apical pole of enterocytes that had uneven thickness and sometimes a double contour pattern. The presence of numerous Brunner glands in the submucosa was also observed along with hemorrhagic suffusions.  To further confirm their suspicions, an electron microscopic examination was conducted which confirmed a diagnosis hypothesis called Microvillus Inclusion Disease (MVID) - a rare genetic disorder affecting intestinal function and nutrient absorption.  Mutation analysis performed on peripheral blood samples confirmed that there was a homozygous mutation in MYO5B gene. MYO5B gene encodes for an important protein involved in trafficking cellular components within intestinal epithelial cells. When this gene mutates or is absent altogether, it can lead to MVID symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and malabsorption.  Despite ongoing medical interventions and management, unfortunately after 97 days of life, septic shock ensued leading to multiple organ failure resulting in his death.  This clinical case highlights not only the complexity but also emphasizes several key points: the importance of careful observation from birth onwards; early recognition and intervention especially when dealing issues such as dehydration; prompt identification through laboratory testing; interdisciplinary care involving different medical specialties; meticulous follow-up to uncover more clues when challenges arise persistently; performing appropriate diagnostic tests such as endoscopy and biopsy ultimately allowing for specific diagnosis like MVID based on characteristic findings - in this case, the brush border abnormalities observed during histopathological examination using PAS stain.",explain
"This clinical case involves a pediatric patient with leptomeningeal spread, which means the tumor has spread within the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The patient underwent two surgical procedures to address their condition.  The first procedure involved placing a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. This is a device made by Medtronic called PS Medical that helps drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain's ventricles into the abdominal cavity, relieving hydrocephalus (increase in fluid pressure within the skull). Following this, a radical resection of the tumor was performed. However, due to safety concerns, some small parts of the tumor remained unresected.  The postoperative period was complicated for this patient as they experienced neurological deterioration, leading to an extended stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). While in ICU, they also suffered cardiac arrest and had a permanent internal defibrillator implanted through their right subclavian vein.  Upon discharge from the neurosurgical department, the patient had severe left hemiparesis (weakness on one side of their body) and required further treatment with high-dose chemotherapy. Over subsequent years, they underwent four revision surgeries related to their shunt. These surgeries involved multiple revisions of both distal and proximal catheters due to malfunction caused by peritoneal malabsorption (inadequate absorption of fluids through abdominal tissue).  In recent times at four years old, this child presented to an emergency department with worsening consciousness level and vomiting. Additional tests were conducted including computer tomography (CT) scan that revealed dilated ventricles and periventricular edema (swelling around brain ventricles). Ultrasound imaging showed bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis (blood clots).  Due to lack of alternative options for treatment strategies at that time point, it was decided to implant a new distal catheter in the right atrium by the interventional cardiologist. This was performed through the left subclavian vein using a percutaneous technique called Seldinger method. The process involved puncturing the subclavian vein with a very thin needle (21 G) and inserting a guide wire to navigate to the desired location. Gradual dilation of the vein was achieved using sheaths of increasing size, ultimately accommodating a peel-away sheath.  Confirmation of catheter placement in the right atrium was obtained using intra-operative x-ray imaging with a C-arm machine. Following successful placement, the dilator was removed and wound closure occurred as per standard procedures. The patient had an uneventful recovery without any postoperative complications, leading to their discharge from hospital after few days.  At one year follow-up, this pediatric patient remains free of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure caused by hydrocephalus. A CT scan showed normalization of ventricular system appearance, indicating that both catheters remain in place appropriately.  This case highlights several significant issues encountered in managing leptomeningeal spread and associated complications such as hydrocephalus and thrombosis. It also demonstrates treatment challenges requiring multiple surgeries and interventions over time. However, despite these complexities, appropriate management has led to an improved clinical outcome for this young patient at least until their one-year follow-up period after last intervention.     This clinical case showcases the complexity involved in managing a pediatric patient with leptomeningeal spread and associated complications. Leptomeningeal spread refers to the metastasis of tumor cells within the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, posing significant challenges for treatment.  In this particular case, the initial surgical interventions addressed two critical issues: hydrocephalus and tumor resection. Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, often requiring surgical intervention to divert and drain excess fluid. The placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed to alleviate this pressure by allowing CSF drainage into the abdominal cavity.  Furthermore, an attempt was made to achieve radical tumor resection. However, due to safety concerns or specific anatomical considerations regarding inaccessible tumor remnants, complete removal could not be achieved. This highlights one of the challenges encountered during surgery - ensuring maximal tumor removal while preserving normal tissue function and avoiding damage.  Following these procedures, complications arose during the postoperative period. The patient experienced neurological deterioration that necessitated an extended stay in the pediatric ICU, emphasizing that even with appropriate management and treatment strategies, unforeseen complications can still occur.  Additionally, a significant event occurred when cardiac arrest transpired during their time in ICU. As a result of this incident, it was necessary to implant a permanent internal defibrillator through their right subclavian vein. This illustrates how cancer-related medical issues can intertwine with other health conditions faced by patients.  The subsequent management involved continued care for both oncological needs and shunt-related issues. High-dose chemotherapy was administered as part of ongoing treatment for leptomeningeal spread.  Multiple revision surgeries were performed over subsequent years due to malfunctions associated with peritoneal malabsorption affecting shunt functioning. Peritoneal malabsorption occurs when there is inadequate absorption of fluids into abdominal tissue, leading to shunt malfunction. To resolve this issue, revision surgeries included various modifications to the catheter system, including revisions of the distal part and introducing a new proximal catheter at the opposite lateral ventricle.  At four years old, the patient presented with deteriorating levels of consciousness and vomiting, which required immediate medical attention. Diagnostic imaging using a CT scan revealed ventricular dilation and periventricular edema (swelling around brain ventricles), indicating increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, ultrasound imaging discovered blood clots or thrombi within both internal jugular veins.  Given limited options available for treatment in this complex situation involving internal jugular vein thrombosis and malpositioned shunt catheters in an already compromised anatomy due to prior surgeries, a decision was made to implant a new distal catheter into the right atrium through the left subclavian vein. This procedure was carried out under interventional cardiologist guidance using percutaneous techniques like the Seldinger method.  The successful placement of the distal catheter was verified by intra-operative x-ray imaging using a C-arm machine - an essential step to ensure proper positioning before concluding the surgery. The wound was then closed following standard procedures.  Fortunately, postoperatively there were no complications reported for this specific intervention. The patient recovered without any symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure caused by hydrocephalus or other related issues. Consequently, they were discharged from hospital several days later free of these symptoms.  At their one-year follow-up evaluation after implementing these interventions successfully without complications arisen thus far since surgery completion,the child remained asymptomatic regarding hydrocephalus-related concerns based on clinical assessment and exhibited normalized appearance of their ventricular system on CT scan - confirming that both catheters remain in place appropriately according to observation results.  This clinical case exemplifies not only difficult decisions that must be made when managing complex medical conditions but also the perseverance and dedication of the healthcare team in providing comprehensive care for pediatric patients with intricate medical presentations. The interdisciplinary collaboration between neurosurgeons, cardiologists, and interventional specialists played a crucial role in delivering optimal treatment. Continued monitoring and regular follow-up will be essential to ensure ongoing effectiveness of the treatment plan for this patient's long-term prognosis and quality of life.",explain
"Case Study: Anti-SRP Antibody Myopathy  Anti-SRP antibody myopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to skeletal muscles. In this case, we have two observations of a Senegalese woman with a history of anti-SRP antibody myopathy.  Observation 1: In the first observation, the patient presented with muscle weakness and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level, an enzyme released from damaged muscles. The absence of Babinski sign and systemic symptoms ruled out central nervous system involvement or generalized manifestations.  Laboratory tests revealed increased CPK level along with positive C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), indicating inflammation in the body. The presence of anti-parietal cell and anti-SRP antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of anti-SRP antibody myopathy. Other autoantibodies such as anti-JO1 and antinuclear antibodies were negative, except for insignificant levels of anti-SSA antibodies.  Further infectious serologies came back negative ruling out common infections like HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C among others. Toxoplasmosis IgG was detected but not IgM suggesting prior exposure rather than an active infection. Epstein Barr virus serology indicated previous infection while the presence of anti-HBs antibodies suggested vaccination against hepatitis B.  Endocrine tests including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), estradiol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) were all within normal range. A standard short synacthen test was negative ruling out adrenal insufficiency.  Cardiac ultrasound appeared normal given no cardiovascular involvement during examination. Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed hypersignal in pelvic and thigh muscles indicative of inflammatory myopathy. Electromyogram showed a pure myogenic pattern, confirming muscle damage.  A surgical muscle biopsy performed on the left thigh further confirmed inflammatory myopathy as it revealed muscular alterations. The final diagnosis was established as anti-SRP antibody myopathy.  Due to worsening muscle weakness, the patient was readmitted where laboratory tests still showed high CPK levels and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). Further treatment consisted of Methylprednisolone and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), which were well tolerated with a decrease in CPK levels post IVIG administration. However, there was no regression in muscle weakness, and the patient was discharged with continued corticosteroid and associated treatment.  Observation 2: In the second observation, the same patient presented again with muscle pain and weakness of lower limbs that had started five months prior to hospitalization. The symptoms began seven months after her previous delivery. During pregnancy, she had stopped treatment for her anti-SRP antibody myopathy without significant change.  Clinical examination revealed muscle paresis of both lower limbs with reduced muscular strength proximally but retained strength distally. Reflexes like knee jerk, ankle jerk reflexes, and idiomuscular response were absent bilaterally along with no Babinski sign observed.  Laboratory tests demonstrated high CPK level along with elevated liver enzymes once again. CRP was positive while creatinine level was low but serum electrolyte levels remained normal. Repeat laboratory tests from an earlier date still indicated significantly elevated CPK levels accompanied by positive CRP values and increased ESR at the first hour.  Anti-SRP antibodies were present while other autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies and anti-JO1 antibodies remained negative. Infectious serologies ruled out common infections like HIV-1&2 or hepatitis B that could contribute to similar symptoms.  Hormonal tests including TSH, ACTH, prolactin, FSH, LH were all within normal range. Cardiac ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Electromyogram demonstrated a pure myogenic pattern consistent with muscle damage.  Treatment in this observation consisted of Solumedrol (Methylprednisolone) with three doses given to the patient. The treatment was well tolerated both clinically and biologically, but there was no improvement in muscle paresis observed even after discharge on corticosteroid and associated treatment.  In conclusion, anti-SRP antibody myopathy is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle inflammation and damage leading to weakness and elevated CPK levels. Despite immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and IVIG being administered, regression of symptoms can be challenging in some cases like the ones described here. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this condition and develop more effective treatment strategies.",explain
"This clinical case description presents the case of a patient with skin complaints that were initially suspected to be tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. The patient denied any previous history of allergies or family history of similar complaints. However, there was no known information about immunization history.  The patient had previously been treated at a local hospital with oral medication and ointments but did not experience significant improvement. Despite this, the patient was otherwise healthy, with a normal body weight of 64 kg.  Upon dermatological examination, the right knee showed an erythematous plaque with a verrucous surface, elevated edge, erythematous base, and crusting. Likewise, the left dorsum pedis had erythematous macules and plaques accompanied by crusting.  Several differential diagnoses were considered in this case including tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, lupus vulgaris (a form of skin tuberculosis), chromoblastomycosis (a fungal infection), and neurodermatitis (a chronic eczematous condition).  Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (an increase in white blood cell count). Other complete blood count results along with blood sugar levels and liver function tests were within normal range. Skin scraping examination did not reveal any acid-resistant bacilli or fungus growth in tissue culture.  Considering these findings along with negative Mantoux test results (which assess for exposure to tuberculosis bacteria), suppurative chronic inflammation suggestive of cutaneous TB was observed on histopathological examination.  To obtain a conclusive diagnosis, further tests were conducted including M. tuberculosis culture using skin tissue samples; Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) which assess for immune response to TB antigens; and GeneXpert method examining M.Tuberculosis using tissue samples.  While these additional tests did not demonstrate the presence or growth of M.Tuberculosis through culture methods after four weeks nor by GeneXpert method analysis; IGRA examination resulted in a positive finding. This positive IGRA result along with the history, physical examination, and supporting tests led to a final diagnosis of tuberculosis verrucosa cutis.  The patient was then prescribed category 1 antituberculosis therapy trial based on their body weight. Treatment involved administering four tablets of fixed-dose combination antituberculosis drugs once daily for four weeks, in addition to a B Complex tablet as supplementary support.  After 21 days of treatment, significant improvements were observed including thinning of the plaque and reduced itching. Furthermore, no adverse reactions were reported by the patient. Consequently, this regimen was continued for two months before transitioning to the maintenance phase in the third month.  During the maintenance phase, two tablets of fixed combination drugs consisting of isoniazid and rifampicin were administered daily. At the end of the six-month treatment period, there was significant improvement evident.  In summary, this clinical case describes a patient who presented with skin lesions initially suspected to be tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. Through comprehensive evaluation including history taking, physical examination findings such as erythematous plaques with crusts and laboratory investigations (including histopathological examination), a diagnosis was established and appropriate antituberculosis treatment resulted in significant improvement over time.  It is crucial to note that each individual's case may differ; therefore consulting with healthcare professionals is essential for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan tailored specifically to their condition.",explain
"This clinical case presents a patient with a swollen right lower limb that has dark discoloration from the toes to mid-thigh, indicating poor circulation. The leg is also cold and there are weak pulses in the popliteal and dorsalis pedis areas compared to the opposite limb. Sensation is intact but there is no muscle power. The rest of the physical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings.  Based on these signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the right thigh secondary to Nicolau syndrome was made. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a closed muscle compartment impairs blood supply, leading to tissue ischemia (lack of oxygen-rich blood) and potential damage. Nicolau syndrome refers to an uncommon complication following intramuscular drug injections resulting in significant local tissue injury.  To further investigate this case, several tests were performed including full blood count (FBC), urea, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, INR (international normalized ratio), and doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb. The FBC results came back normal; however, urea and creatinine levels were elevated indicating impaired kidney function with values of 13.5mmol/l and 242.2umol/l respectively.  Liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly elevated at 997.7U/L and 115.6IU/L respectively suggesting liver dysfunction or injury. INR was mildly elevated at 1.57 which can indicate impaired coagulation ability.  Emergency fasciotomy surgery was conducted after approximately 24 hours from presentation when surgeons reviewed the patient's condition intraoperatively revealing bulging osteofascial compartments upon incision with clear fluid but minimal bleeding observed.  Following surgery, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered including imipenem IV three times daily along with metronidazole IV. Analgesia was provided with tramadol IM twice a day. The acute kidney injury (AKI) was managed conservatively by restricting fluid intake and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs. After five days, the AKI resolved with urea and creatinine levels dropping to 3.36mmol/l and 37.26umol/l respectively.  Liver function also improved as ALT and AST dropped to 64.1U/L and 180.3IU/l respectively, while albumin levels were measured at 18.5g/L.  Despite these improvements, there was no recovery of blood circulation in the right leg and foot two days after fasciotomy surgery resulting in dry gangrene where the affected tissues no longer receive adequate blood flow leading to tissue death (necrosis). Planned below knee amputation was suggested as a treatment option but parents denied consent, delaying appropriate management.  As time progressed, the patient's condition deteriorated further with spiking temperatures despite being on imipenem antibiotic therapy for infection control. The swelling worsened with intense pain in the right thigh, accompanied by blister formation on the thigh skin indicating progression from dry gangrene to wet gangrene where bacterial infection is present along with tissue death.  Thirteen days after fasciotomy surgery, a diagnosis of dry gangrene with superimposed wet gangrene was officially made based on physical examination findings as depicted in Figure 3.  Parents were again counseled about the urgent need for amputation but refused consent once more until finally approving an above knee amputation (AKA) four days later due to worsening clinical condition including convulsions attributed to high body temperatures which were controlled using diazepam IV injections.  The AKA procedure revealed cooked muscles in the patient's right thigh due to poor perfusion or inadequate blood supply for an extended period of time resulting in muscle damage due to oxygen deprivation.  Postoperatively, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and tramadol were administered. Fever resolved following the amputation. The surgical wound was exposed 24 hours later and ordered to be cleaned daily.  Once stable, the patient was discharged but required occupational therapy sessions at the physiotherapy department as shown in Figure 4 to aid in her rehabilitation after amputation.  In summary, this case highlights the complications that can arise from a severe condition like compartment syndrome. Delayed treatment due to parental refusal for consent resulted in further progression of gangrene and subsequent amputation. This emphasizes the importance of timely medical intervention and informed decision making for appropriate management of critical conditions like compartment syndrome.",explain
"In this clinical case, a pregnant patient with a history of two previous vaginal deliveries and no complications presented to the hospital after being diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, typically in one of the fallopian tubes. In this particular case, the patient had a viable intrauterine fetus but also a demised left adnexal fetus.  The patient did not have any constitutional symptoms such as fever or weight loss, and she did not report any significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. She had no medical or surgical history of note and tested negative for HIV. It is important to mention that she had not been screened for cervical cancer before.  On physical examination, the patient appeared conscious and stable with normal blood pressure and pulse rate. However, she felt warm to touch indicating a possible mild fever. Her abdominal examination did not reveal any abnormalities except for bilateral adnexal fullness. Adnexa refers to structures adjacent to the uterus, including ovaries and fallopian tubes.  Laboratory findings showed neutrophilic leucocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) along with normocytic anemia (low red blood cell count), which is often seen in cases of infection or inflammation.  The initial plan was to perform laparoscopy on this patient; however due to limitations in theater availability, it was decided to proceed with laparotomy instead. A Pfannestiel incision (a horizontal cut made just above the pubic area) was created, revealing around 100 milliliters of pus within the abdomen (pyoperitoneum). To further examine all areas of the abdomen, a midline incision was made.  During exploration through these incisions it became evident that there was an ectopic pregnancy on her left side at one end of her fallopian tube which resulted in rupture. As a result, the fallopian tube was removed (salpingectomy) to prevent further complications. An identifiable fetus was noted and no histology (tissue analysis) was performed on it.  Interestingly, a ruptured appendix with a well-organized abscess was also found during the surgery. The remains of the appendix were minimal and all necrotic debris was removed. The rest of the abdomen appeared normal with only scanty fibrinous adhesions, which are bands of scar tissue that can form in response to inflammation or injury.  To ensure thorough cleansing of the abdominal cavity, a saline lavage (washing out with saline solution) was performed before closing up. Unfortunately, due to extensive necrosis (tissue death), there was no viable appendix specimen available for histology.  Postoperatively, the patient received intravenous fluids along with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) for infection control purposes and paracetamol for pain management. She recovered well without any complications and was discharged on the fifth day after undergoing laparotomy.  Two weeks later she returned for follow-up review where she reported feeling well and her surgical incision appeared to be healing nicely. Ultrasound confirmed that her intrauterine pregnancy continued successfully; however, further information about its outcome is still pending investigation.  In conclusion, this clinical case describes a pregnant patient who presented with both an ectopic pregnancy requiring surgical intervention as well as an incidental finding of a ruptured appendix during surgery. Prompt management through laparotomy led to successful removal of the ectopic pregnancy and treatment of appendicitis resulting in complete recovery for the patient during her hospital stay.

"This clinical case describes a patient presenting with a syndrome of inflammation and liver cytolysis. The laboratory findings suggest an elevated sedimentation rate (SV), fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as abnormal liver function tests. Furthermore, there are indications of hemophagocytosis on the myelogram.  The patient's blood work reveals significant inflammation, with an elevated sedimentation rate (SV) of 49 mm in the first hour and increased levels of fibrinogen (5.1 g/l) and CRP (86 mg/l). These markers indicate an ongoing inflammatory process in the body.  Liver enzymes are also elevated, including aspartate transaminase (ASAT) at 348 UI/L, alanine transaminase (ALAT) at 49 UI/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at 96 UI/L, alkaline phosphatases at 158 UI/L, and total bilirubin at 59 mg/l. These findings suggest liver damage or dysfunction.  Other notable abnormalities include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of 1234 UI/L, which can be indicative of tissue damage or increased cell turnover. Triglyceride levels are significantly elevated at 5.72 mmol/l; normal range is typically between 0.35-1.7 mmol/l. High triglyceride levels can be associated with various metabolic disorders.  Additionally, ferritinemia is raised to 2017 g/l; normal range is typically between 30-400 g/L). Elevated ferritin levels can occur during periods of systemic inflammation or as a result of conditions such as hemochromatosis.  To investigate for possible infectious causes that may contribute to these findings, extensive testing has been performed including blood cultures and serology for various pathogens such as herpesviruses (HSV1/2), parvovirus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus (HHV6/8). The results of these tests are negative, suggesting that an infectious cause is unlikely.  Further investigations into gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections were also performed with negative results on coprocultures and PCR testing.  The myelogram reveals numerous images of hemophagocytosis, which is the engulfment of blood cells by phagocytic cells in the bone marrow. This finding suggests the presence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a severe and potentially life-threatening complication characterized by excessive immune system activation.  One week after admission, an axillary lymphadenopathy develops. It is described as a 1 cm x 1 cm solid, mobile mass that causes pain. Emergency removal of the lymphadenopathy was carried out, and subsequent examination revealed modified architecture along with infiltration by mononuclear inflammatory cells arranged in layers. A few giant cells are present along with fibrosis scattered throughout the pulp of the node. There are rare enlarged nucleus cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm; this finding supports sclerodular lymph histiocyte disorder. Immunohistochemical staining further confirms this diagnosis by detecting positive anti-CD30 antibodies and MUM1 antigen but negative CD15 antibodies.  To determine disease extension since resources for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan are limited, a cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan is performed. This reveals involvement of mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes along with hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) that appears homogeneous on imaging studies alongside multiple effusions in body cavities such as pleural or peritoneal spaces.  Screening for viral hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is negative, indicating the absence of these viral infections. The patient also undergoes an echocardiography, which demonstrates a ejection fraction of 75%, indicating normal heart function.  For treatment, the patient receives four courses of dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day followed by ABVD chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vinblastine, bleomycin, dacarbazine) for eight cycles. This results in partial remission. Subsequently, the patient undergoes ICE second-line chemotherapy protocol which consists of etoposide , holoxan , mesna , and carboplatin for four additional cycles with good response to treatment.  In conclusion, this clinical case reveals a complex presentation with evidence of systemic inflammation and liver dysfunction. The presence of hemophagocytosis on myelogram suggests macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Axillary lymphadenopathy biopsy confirms sclerodular lymph histiocyte disorder involvement in bone marrow infiltration. Imaging studies reveal widespread lymph node involvement as well as hepatosplenomegaly and multiple effusions. The patient has been treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy resulting in partial remission thus far. Close monitoring will be required to assess response to therapy and overall prognosis in this stage IVb sclerodular LH diagnosis.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever and rash, along with other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical history or surgical procedures, and was not taking any significant medications or recreational drugs. The patient is a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal.  On examination, the patient appeared ill and had vital signs indicative of an infection - low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. A rash was observed on the torso, back, limbs, and palms of the hands. Additionally, the patient had inflammation of the eyelids (desquamating lesions) and conjunctivitis. The abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal.  Initial diagnostic tests showed elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers in the blood. However, blood cultures remained negative for any bacterial infection. Other diagnostic tests including lumbar puncture (for viral analysis) chest radiograph (to examine the lungs), abdominal sonar (to assess abdominal organs) came back normal.  Differential diagnoses were considered for both infectious causes like viral infections such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus seroconversion or Epstein-Barr Virus infection; bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci or Neisseria meningitidis; non-infectious causes like Kawasaki-like disease or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.  The treatment plan initially included antibiotics to cover possible bacterial infections along with doxycycline for rickettsial disease. Intravenous fluids were given but did not result in significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters.  However,on day four of admission,since persistently low mean arterial pressures along with other symptoms persisted,a repeat echocardiogram revealed structural abnormalities in the heart including reduced ejection fraction(HF), chamber dilation and valve regurgitation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started along with a dobutamine infusion and diuresis to improve the heart's function. Steroids were also initiated and the patient showed improvement with no further temperature spikes.  Further testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the patient had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which is potentially related to COVID-19 infection.  The patient continued to improve over time, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of inflammatory markers. Follow-up visits showed complete recovery, and the treatment was well tolerated without any side effects.  In conclusion, this clinical case presents a patient who initially presented with fever, rash, and other symptoms suggestive of an infectious or autoimmune process. Through a thorough diagnostic workup involving various tests and examinations, it was ultimately determined that the patient had MIS-C potentially related to a recent COVID-19 infection. The prompt initiation of appropriate treatment led to full recovery without any residual symptoms. After the patient's hospital discharge, they were followed up in the rheumatology outpatient clinic two weeks later for further evaluation. During this visit, it was noted that the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. The rash had completely resolved, with only a few areas of residual hyperpigmentation. There were no signs of tachycardia or heart failure on examination.  A repeat echocardiogram was performed and showed significant improvement in cardiac function, with an increase in ejection fraction to 57% and no sign of pericardial effusion. Based on these positive findings, the patient's medication regimen was adjusted. Prednisone dosage was gradually reduced to 10mg daily over time and subsequently tapered down over four weeks.  The treatment course was well tolerated by the patient, who did not experience any side effects related to the medications. They were able to return to school without any limitations or complications.  Follow-up visits will continue to be scheduled for monitoring purposes in the coming months as part of ongoing care for this patient.  It is worth noting that informed consent was obtained from the patient regarding both historical and clinical information as well as any images used throughout their medical case presentation, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.  In summary, this clinical case highlights a unique presentation of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) potentially associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. Through appropriate diagnostic assessments and therapeutic interventions including IV immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), dobutamine infusion, diuresis, corticosteroids (prednisone), along with antibiotics initially provided adequate management leading to resolution of symptoms and complete recovery in this young individual. Close follow-up care will be continued to ensure ongoing health monitoring post-discharge from hospital. ",explain
"This clinical case describes the presentation, evaluation, and management of a patient with several concerning symptoms and laboratory findings. The initial presentation involves an acutely ill-febrile patient with a high temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), normal blood pressure, elevated pulse rate, and elevated respiratory rate. Despite these symptoms, the rest of the physical examination appears normal.  The initial laboratory evaluation reveals some abnormalities in the blood work. The leukocyte count is slightly elevated but within a relatively normal range; however, there is an increased percentage of neutrophils indicating possible infection or inflammation. Hemoglobin levels are within normal limits, but there is a low platelet count suggestive of thrombocytopenia. Prolonged clotting times are observed in both APTT and prothrombin time tests which may suggest impaired coagulation function.  Further evaluation shows slight elevation in INR values which can be indicative of liver dysfunction or impaired clotting factors synthesis by the liver. The presence of hematuria indicates blood in the urine but may not necessarily point to specific causes based on this information alone.  Given these findings, treatment begins with intravenous ciprofloxacin for suspected bacterial infection along with metronidazole and parenteral artesunate to address potential parasitic infections such as malaria.  On subsequent review, there are additional changes in the patient's condition including increased tenderness on specific areas indicating possible abdominal involvement along with persistent vomiting. These changes lead to adjustments in antibiotic therapy including switching from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone.  Later assessment reveals new symptoms involving rhinorrhea (runny nose), mild throat inflammation without significant lymph node enlargement, decreased breath sounds on lung examination particularly on lower zones that coincide with patchy opacities observed on chest X-ray images predominantly seen on the right side upper and lower lung zones.  Suspecting suboptimal treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin is added to cover potential atypical respiratory pathogens.  However, despite these adjustments, the patient's condition worsens with increasing fever, tachypnea (rapid breathing), and low blood oxygen levels. Breath sounds on examination suggest consolidation and obstruction in the right lower lung zone. Laboratory evaluation shows worsening hematuria, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count).  Malaria parasite detection tests repeatedly show negative results ruling out that specific infection. The patient requires respiratory support in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to severe dyspnea.  During ICU care, oxygen therapy helps alleviate breathing difficulties while the patient continues to have a high fever along with tachypnea and develops dark-colored stools suggesting gastrointestinal involvement leading to diarrhea.  On the 10th day of admission after a thorough viral hemorrhagic fever screening panel using real-time RNA polymerase chain reaction technique aiming towards identifying RNA from multiple viral agents including Dengue virus confirms positive results for Dengue virus infection.  Supportive management continues as there are no specific antiviral medications available for Dengue virus treatment. After 16 days of conservative management in the hospital, including supportive measures such as fluid replacement and close monitoring of vital signs, the patient eventually recovers without any complications and is discharged home.  During one year of follow-up after discharge from hospital care, blood pressure stabilizes within normal range without requiring medication demonstrating a successful recovery from this illness.  In summary, this clinical case presents a complex scenario where an acutely ill febrile patient initially presents with nonspecific symptoms but eventually develops severe respiratory distress along with gastrointestinal involvement. Despite initial treatments targeting bacterial infections or parasitic diseases like malaria based on laboratory findings indicating neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia alongside prolonged coagulation times may point towards bleeding disorders or systemic infections like Dengue virus infection. Prompt identification of the specific pathogen, supportive management, and careful monitoring in an ICU setting can lead to successful recovery and better patient outcomes.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a giant sub-capsular hematoma in the liver, along with symptoms of fever, pain in the right hypochondrium (upper right abdomen), and altered blood laboratory test results. The incident was spontaneous and not caused by trauma or any underlying liver tumor.  The patient's initial physical examination showed a general condition scored WHO 2, indicating that they were moderately ill. Their blood pressure was 132/80 mm Hg, which is within the normal range, but their heart rate was elevated at 105 beats per minute. The patient also had a high temperature of 38.9°C.  During palpation of the right hypochondrium area, severe pain was reported by the patient. However, the remainder of their physical examination appeared to be normal.  The blood laboratory tests revealed several findings that were abnormal. Hemoglobin levels were at 10.1 g/dl, which is lower than the reference range for healthy individuals. The leukocyte count was significantly increased at 13,370 elm/ml (normal range: 4-11 x10^3 cells/µl), with predominantly polynuclear cells present (8,300 elm/ml). There was no lymphopenia observed (3,400 elm/ml). Platelet count came out to be at a normal level of 276 x10^3 cel/µL.  Furthermore,his hepatic transaminase levels were slightly elevated— aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 76 IU/ml and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at72 IU/ml—indicating some degree of liver injury or dysfunction.Surprisingly,the hemostasis or clotting profile seemed unaffected;other coagulation parameters like prothrombin ratio,international normalized ratio(INR)and KCT(also known as PTT)were within their respective ranges.The absence  The patient had a prior abdominal computerized tomography (CT-scan) that was done nine days prior to admission, which confirmed the presence of a giant sub-capsular hematoma in the liver. The hematoma measured 136 mm x 80 mm and involved segments VI, VII, and VIII.  An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed on the day of admission, confirmed the diagnosis. It showed that the hematoma was undergoing resorption but did not identify any traumatic or hepatic tumor pathology as an underlying cause for bleeding.  To treat this condition, ultrasound-guided drainage of the hematoma was performed using a G10 diameter nephrostomy drain under local anesthesia. During placement of the drain, 800 ml of blood was drained from the hematoma. Bacteriological study of this fluid did not show any bacterial contamination.  After drainage, an abdominal CT-scan was conducted on the first day to assess drain placement and consider its mobilization. However, radiological signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in lung cuts during this scan. A subsequent thoracic CT-scan revealed ground-glass opacities with moderate pulmonary involvement estimated between 15% and 20%. These findings suggested that along with their existing condition, such as severe hepatic hematomas;the patient also contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Interestingly enough,during review of previous radiological examinations conducted at other facilities for managing their liver problem,SAME lung abnormalities were noted.But those scans' radiologists did NOT report these changes.Following these observations,a sample from their nasopharynx sent for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing came back positive for Gene N and Gene E-subtypes used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection.Thus,it seems that this patient had contracted COVID-19 without them noticing it before,due to lack/not properlyreported lung abnormalities in previous radiology scans.  In line with the national protocol,the treating team prescribed a combination of Azithromycin 500mg on the first day followed by 250 mg for the next four days,and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times a day for ten days to tackle their COVID-19 infection. The patient's condition improved fairly quickly, with symptom drying up by day two and fever resolving on day three. Their general condition also improved following removal of the drain.  With uncomplicated progression, the patient was discharged on day seven from hospitalization. They were advised to continue self-isolation at home for another 14 days as per guidelines to ensure complete recovery and prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  In summary, this clinical case describes an individual who was admitted with a spontaneous sub-capsular liver hematoma along with symptoms indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite involvement of a critical organ like liver in hematoma,the individual responded well to treatment aimed at managing both conditions and eventually showed favorable outcomes before being discharged.Definitely,this case highlights an interesting phenomenon where concomitant pathologies can occur without diagnosis or apparently asymptomatic state .Understanding such cases is crucial to provide comprehensive care as missing associations like herein may have led exclusionary diagnostic errors thus hampering timely management interventions or delaying containment strategies related to co-infections etc",explain
"This clinical case describes a young girl who presents with abdominal distention, tenderness, pain, and positive fluid thrill on examination. The patient also has abnormal laboratory findings including low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Abdominal ultrasound reveals significant ascites with mixed liquid/solid content.  Based on the clinical findings, the decision was made to perform an emergency explorative laparotomy. During the procedure, it was discovered that the peritoneal fluid was purulent and contained an unusually large amount of free fluid. Furthermore, there were multiple caseous nodes scattered throughout the peritoneum and bowel suggestive of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis. Additionally, there were three major perforations in the jejunum with surrounding hyperemic and inflamed tissue indicative of typhoid bowel perforation. However, no perforations were observed in other hyperemic intestinal typhoid lesions.  The surgical approach included lavage of the abdominal cavity to remove pus and exploration of all parts of the bowel for any additional lesions or perforations. The three jejunal perforations were primarily closed using a separate stitch technique to promote healing. Given the severity of contamination found during surgery, a delayed primary closure strategy was employed along with placement of drains and leaving a laparostomy open for future monitoring.  Laboratory analysis from samples taken during surgery revealed acid-fast bacilli on staining consistent with tuberculous infection and positive serology for Salmonella Typhi confirming typhoid fever diagnosis. Despite initiating antibiotic treatment targeting both infectious etiologies (ciprofloxacin for typhoid fever), unfortunately, due to uncertain origin of peritoneal lesions causing miliary tuberculosis; specific treatment for this condition wasn't initiated at this time.  Throughout all procedures performed on this patient's abdomen-based diagnosis coupled with therapy being executed-there persisted severe instability requiring correction via electrolyte rebalancing, fluid replacement, and blood transfusion. Despite the best efforts by the medical team, the patient's condition gradually worsened leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure. Unfortunately, after 18 hours post-surgery, the young girl succumbed to her illness.  Overall, this clinical case highlights a complex scenario of a young girl presenting with abdominal distention and pain indicative of peritoneal disease. The subsequent exploratory surgery revealed multiple pathologies including miliary peritoneal tuberculosis and typhoid bowel perforation. Despite intervention, the severity of contamination coupled with underlying infectious processes led to progressive deterioration in the patient's condition resulting in a fatal outcome. This clinical case presents a challenging scenario with multiple factors contributing to the patient's poor outcome. The presence of ascites with mixed liquid/solid content on abdominal ultrasound, along with the remarkable symmetrical distention and positive fluid thrill, indicated a significant accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. This finding raised suspicions of an underlying pathology such as infection or inflammation.  The laboratory findings further supported this suspicion. The low white blood cell count (1300 cells/mm³) indicated leukopenia, which can be a sign of immune compromise in severe infections. The low hemoglobin levels (7.7 g/dl) indicated anemia, which can be associated with chronic infections or blood loss secondary to bowel perforation. Additionally, the elevated ESR (44 mm/h) suggested ongoing inflammation within the body.  During the exploratory laparotomy, findings revealed purulent free peritoneal fluid measuring approximately 4 liters and retroperitoneal lymphomegaly suggestive of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis as observed through multiple caseous nodules spread across the peritoneum and bowel walls ranging from 0.5 to 4 mm in diameter.  The identification of three major perforations on the jejunum further complicated this case. These jejunal perforations were surrounded by hyperemic and inflamed tissue consistent with typhoid bowel perforation caused by Salmonella Typhi infection.  The surgical procedure included closing these perforations using a separate stitch technique to promote healing and prevent further dissemination of bacteria into the abdominal cavity using healthy portions of tissue near each perforation site for closure purposes.  Given the severity of abdominal contamination detected during surgery, combined management strategies were employed to address both localized infections - ciprofloxacin for typhoid fever - as well as systemic issues - metronidazole was administered intravenously at surgery completion for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage against anaerobic pathogens involved in intra-abdominal infections.  Unfortunately, despite the prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and efforts to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. The presence of septic shock and multi-organ failure suggested an overwhelming systemic response to infection with a high bacterial load in the abdominal cavity. These complications can lead to dysfunction in different organs such as the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, liver, and kidneys, ultimately resulting in a fatal outcome.  It is important to acknowledge that this case posed significant diagnostic challenges due to multiple factors at play: coexistence of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis and typhoid bowel perforation presented with overlapping symptoms and similar clinical features. Although a serological test confirmed the diagnosis of typhoid fever based on positive Salmonella Typhi antibodies, it remained unclear whether the miliary peritoneal tuberculosis contributed significantly or acted merely as an incidental finding.  In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates a complex situation involving multiple pathologies contributing to severe abdominal findings. The underlying conditions involved miliary peritoneal tuberculosis along with typhoid bowel perforation caused by Salmonella Typhi infection. Despite prompt surgical intervention followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy targeting both infections encountered during surgery (typhoid fever was treated with ciprofloxacin), combined with measures aimed at correcting fluid-electrolyte imbalances - unfortunately, these interventions did not alter the course of disease progression leading ultimately to septic shock and multi-organ failure.",explain
"Clinical Case 1: The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), which was confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The absence of an annular abscess indicated a specific type of IE. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 14,500 mm3, indicating an inflammatory response to infection. The hemoglobin concentration was low at 9.3 g/l, suggesting the presence of anemia. Creatinine levels were slightly elevated at 92 μmol/l, indicating some impairment in kidney function. C-reactive protein levels were significantly elevated at 123 mg/dl, pointing towards ongoing inflammation.  Further investigations were conducted to rule out any neurological involvement. Computed topographic scan results showed no abnormalities in the head region.  Blood cultures initially grew Staphylococcus aureus, confirming the bacterial etiology of IE. As a result, antibiotic treatment with Oxacillin and gentamicin was initiated and led to symptom improvement within 72 hours.  However, four days after admission, the patient experienced sudden-onset substernal chest pain. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings showed ST segment elevation in leads V3-V4, which is consistent with myocardial ischemia or injury. Emergency echocardiography revealed the disappearance of vegetation on the mitral valve.  Coronary angiography performed during this acute episode demonstrated complete occlusion in the distal tract of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery while all other coronary arteries were unaffected by stenosis or atherosclerotic lesions. Prompt management involved aspirating thrombus from the occluded vessel leading to restoration of normal blood flow once again (TIMI flow grade 3).  Following this interventional procedure, both patient complaints and ECG changes improved significantly over time suggesting effective treatment intervention for acute coronary artery occlusion related to IE. Finally,due completion off six weeks of antibiotic treatment, the patient was discharged.   Clinical Case 2: The second case involves a 72-year-old male patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease and presenting with an initial complaint of fever and lethargy lasting for two months. The patient had coronary risk factors including age and hypertension.  Laboratory tests revealed significant inflammation with elevated C-reactive protein levels at 178 mg/l, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Anemia was also identified with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dl, suggesting potential underlying issues. Renal function was within normal limits.  Peripheral blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, confirming bacterial involvement in this case as well.  Transthoracic echocardiography showed the presence of a large circumferential periaortic abscess along with moderate aortic regurgitation based on doppler findings. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed these observations.  Additional imaging studies were performed to assess other potential complications related to infective endocarditis. A computed tomographic scan revealed no abnormalities in the head region, while an abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated the presence of a mycotic aneurysm measuring 13 mm in one branch of the superior mesenteric artery.  Three days after admission, worsening chest pain was reported by the patient. Electrocardiogram findings showed significant anterior ST depression pattern indicating myocardial ischemia/infarction-like changes occurred during this acute episode.Of note,the troponin I level rose significantly to 5.3 ng/ml signifying myocardial injury secondary to impaired blood supply or demand imbalance .  Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated narrowing in both left main and LAD arteries indicative compromised flow in critical vessels.Due to complex coronary anatomy highlighting obstructive lesions situated next to vast perianneurysmal flow cavity,a multidisciplinary team decided terminated surgical intervention given poor prognosis despite attempts Intraoperative findings showed a large aortic root abscess compressing both the left main and LAD arteries. Surgical management involved obligating the abscess cavity, replacing the aortic valve with a bioprosthesis, reconstructing the annulus using pericardium, and performing a single aortocoronary bypass graft utilizing the left internal mammary artery.  Post-surgical management demonstrated considerable difficulty in weaning the patient off bypass machine/support system despite intra-aortic balloon pumping, high-dose catecholamine support,joint implementation of multiguideline,drugs regime and vigorous antibiotics. Unfortunately,the patient's condition deteriorated further,and he ultimately succumbed to complications after 48 hours following surgery.  In summary, these two clinical cases illustrate different presentations and complications associated with infective endocarditis. While both cases involved Staphylococcus aureus infections leading to systemic symptoms and vascular complications, individual patient characteristics and specific anatomical involvement resulted in distinct clinical courses with varying outcomes for each case.

"This clinical case describes a boy who presented with various symptoms including abdominal distension, pallor, recurrent fevers, and a history of blood transfusions. The patient did not have any history of jaundice, vomiting, urinary or bowel complaints, bleeding from any site, or neurological complaints.  Upon admission, the patient appeared very pale with silvery gray scalp hair and white eyelashes. Physical examination revealed hypotonia (low muscle tone), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), fever of 40°C (104°F), lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes), and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).  Initial blood tests showed pancytopenia, which is a condition characterized by low levels of all three major types of blood cells: red blood cells (hemoglobin was low at 6.3 g/dL), white blood cells (1980 white blood cells/µL) including neutrophils and lymphocytes with reduced levels as well as low platelet count (44 000/µL). However, there were no giant cytoplasmic granules in the leukocytes.  Liver function tests showed normal results except for low albumin levels and increased alkaline phosphatase levels. Other abnormal findings included high triglycerides, ferritin levels above normal range indicating iron overload in tissues along with very high lactate dehydrogenase level which can indicate tissue damage or inflammation.  The elevated C-reactive protein indicated an inflammatory response in the body. A chest X-ray was normal while an abdominal ultrasound revealed enlarged liver and spleen but no abnormalities in the bile ducts or ascites.  Based on these findings such as hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia accompanied by hypofibrinogenemia - a syndrome known as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) - was suspected. A bone marrow aspiration was performed, which showed numerous morphologically benign macrophages with hemophagocytic activity confirming the diagnosis of MAS.  Various infectious causes were ruled out through blood and urine examinations as well as specific viral serologies for diseases like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis A, B, C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient's history of recurrent infection, consanguineous (related by blood) family background and the presence of silvery-gray pigmentation in hair and eyebrows led to a suspicion of Griscelli Syndrome. Light microscopy examination of the hair confirmed large clumps of irregular pigments characteristic of Griscelli Syndrome.  Molecular biology tests revealed a mutation in the RAB27A gene, confirming a diagnosis of Griscelli syndrome type 2.  The first-line treatment for MAS complicating Griscelli syndrome type 2 involved parenteral administration of high doses of corticosteroids. However, this did not result in significant improvement as evidenced by ongoing involvement all three cell lines in blood count along with elevated ferritin and triglyceride levels. Therefore, additional drugs such as etoposide (a chemotherapy agent) and cyclophosphamide were administered which resulted in improvements seenin blood cell counts including decreasing ferritin levels while bone marrow examination showed reduced numbers of macrophages with low hemophagocytic activity.  In addition to treating the underlying condition, appropriate management was also employed for any coexisting infections using intravenous antibiotics such as ceftazidime combined with an aminoglycoside antibiotic.  The patient was discharged from the hospital on prednisone and cyclosporine while being placed on the waiting list for bone marrow transplantation (BMT).  In conclusion, this case highlights the complexity involved in diagnosing rare genetic disorders such as Griscelli syndrome type 2 that can present with various symptoms including organomegaly, abnormal blood counts, and hyperferritinemia. Prompt diagnosis is important for appropriate management, in this case using a combination of corticosteroids and chemotherapy drugs to address the MAS component as well as managing any concurrent infections. Bone marrow transplantation may be necessary for long-term management of the underlying genetic condition.",explain
"This clinical case presents the story of a patient who presented with abnormal laboratory results and imaging findings suggestive of liver abscesses. The patient's treatment involved antimicrobial therapy, drainage of the abscesses, and a successful recovery.  The initial laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), indicating an immune response to infection. Additionally, the patient had an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, which is another marker for inflammation in the body. Mildly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were also present, suggesting some liver involvement.  Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver and spleen with two sizable hypoechoic lesions. These lesions were further characterized by abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, showing hypodense lesions with peripheral enhancement after contrast administration. This suggested that these lesions were consistent with hepatic abscesses.  The patient was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Culture-guided antimicrobials were initiated along with appropriate drainage as the first option. Initial percutaneous sonographically guided aspiration yielded purulent material from one of the abscess cavities, which was sent for culture analysis. The bacterial isolate was identified as Aggregatibacter aphrophilus using automated systems and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).  The sensitivity test indicated that A. aphrophilus showed susceptibility to several antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin,and meropenem.  Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and drainage procedures being performed on days 5thand 8thof admission,the patient continued to experience irregular spikes of fever accompanying night sweats.This raised concerns about possible sources of infection outside the liver abscesses. Extensive screenings for other infectious causes including gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation, transthoracic echocardiography, and various antibody tests were conducted but no alternative sources of infection were identified.  In response to the persistent fever and night sweats, ciprofloxacin was discontinued and meropenem was administered instead. This change in antibiotic regimen led to improvement in the patient's clinical condition.  The drains that were placed during the abscess drainage procedures were removed once the fluid from the abscess cavities became clear. Meropenem therapy was continued for a total of 2 weeks before switching to oral ciprofloxacin for another 4 weeks. The patient ultimately made a full recovery and was discharged from the hospital.  Follow-up imaging obtained nearly 2 months after drainage showed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual cavities, indicating a successful resolution of the abscesses.  In summary,this case highlights an interesting presentation of hepatic abscesses caused by A. aphrophilus in a patient who experienced persistent fever despite appropriate treatment. Prompt recognition through imaging, targeted antimicrobial therapy guided by sensitivity testing, and timely drainage contributed to the successful resolution of this patient's condition without needing surgical intervention.  This case underscores the importance of considering atypical pathogens as potential causes for infections when conventional diagnostic measures prove inconclusive.A multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease experts,radiologists,and interventional radiologists contributed to positive outcomes in this case The presentation of hepatic abscesses caused by Aggregatibacter aphrophilus is relatively rare, as this bacterium is typically associated with oral infections such as endocarditis or brain abscesses. The fact that this patient did not have any evidence of these typical sources of infection made the diagnosis even more challenging.  Hepatic abscesses can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In this case, A. aphrophilus was identified as the causative pathogen through culture and sensitivity testing.  The treatment approach for hepatic abscesses generally involves a combination of targeted antimicrobial therapy and drainage procedures. Antimicrobials are used to eliminate the causative organism and control the infection, while drainage is necessary to remove purulent material from the abscess cavities.  In this case, percutaneous drainage was performed initially to aspirate purulent material from one of the liver abscess cavities using ultrasound guidance. Subsequently, CT-guided catheter drainage was performed on both abscesses on days 5thand 8thof admission to ensure complete evacuation and adequate management.  The choice of antibiotics is typically guided by culture results and susceptibility testing. In this case, since A. aphrophilus showed susceptibility to ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,and meropenem among other antibiotics; these were used in combination initially in an empirical regimen before switching specifically for better management against A.aggregaapholiusinfections onto intravenous meropenem treatment once susceptibility results were available.  A notable aspect in this case was the persistence of fever with day-time variation accompanied by night sweats despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting A.aphrophilus.This raised concerns for possible alternative sources of infection apart from hepatic involvement.Further investigations including endoscopic evaluation,blood cultures,and echocardiography were conducted to exclude these possibilities.  Echocardiography is an important diagnostic tool in cases of recurrent fever with no clear source as it can detect infective endocarditis. In this case, echocardiography showed mild mitral regurgitation but no vegetations, suggesting that infective endocarditisis not the source of persistent fever.  Gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation was also performed to rule out any possible source of infection within the gastrointestinal tract. However, no evidence of abscesses or other abnormal findings were observed during this procedure.  Additional serological tests for other parasitic infections and multiple bacterial infections including Entamoeba histolytica,A.canis,A.brucella(leishmania Abs,echinococcus Abs)were conducted to assess if alternative sources may have contributed to the patient's continued symptoms.All these investigations returned negative results.No underlying immunodeficiency conditions including HIV were identified either  The multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease specialists,radiologists,and interventional radiologists was crucial in managing this complex case. Their expertise and collaboration facilitated accurate diagnosis through appropriate imaging techniques, culture analysis,and comprehensive evaluation for potential alternative sources of infection.  Despite the challenges encountered throughout this patient's treatment course,the combination therapy consisting of appropriate antimicrobial administration guided by sensitivity testing and timely drainage procedures led to successful clinical improvement and complete resolution without requiring surgical intervention,such as open surgical drainage or liver resection.  Following approximately 2 months from drainage; imaging revealed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual cavities indicating a satisfactory outcome and successful healing process with complete recovery from hepatic abscesses caused by A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus.For optimal recovery outreach,the patient was discharged on oral ciprofloxacin therapy following consolidation IV meropenem treatment  This clinical case underscores several important points.The first is the need for maintaining a high index when faced with atypical presentations or cases that do not respond as expected to initial treatment.Effective communication and collaboration among healthcare professionals and specialties are crucial for thorough evaluation of potential alternative sources guiding appropriate investigations.  Given that hepatic abscesses can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including rare ones like A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus, it is important to consider the possibility of unusual organisms when standard diagnostic tests do not provide clear answers.  In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates the challenges encountered in diagnosing and treating hepatic abscesses caused by A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus. The multidisciplinary approach involving accurate imaging techniques, targeted antimicrobial therapy guided by susceptibility testing, and timely drainage played a crucial role in achieving complete resolution without the need for surgical intervention. The case also highlights the importance of considering atypical pathogens when conventional diagnostic measures prove inconclusive.",explain
"This clinical case involves a child who presented with several symptoms and was eventually diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia. Let's break down the case step by step:  On arrival, the child had oxygen saturation of 99%, a heart rate of 164 beats per minute, and a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius. The child had experienced a head injury and was initially seen by a paediatrician who requested consultation from a paediatric surgeon.  The paediatric surgery examination revealed that the child had no visible lesions on the head, normal eye pupil reactions to light, soft abdomen without signs of irritation, and absence of bowel sounds. However, there were intermittent peripheral acrocyanosis (bluish discoloration) observed.  Due to deterioration in the child's condition during examination, blood samples were taken and attempts were made to perform chest and abdominal x-rays. However, before this could happen, the mother accidentally breastfed the child which resulted in vomiting and loss of consciousness.  Without establishing a definite diagnosis due to lack of x-ray results, an anesthesiologist was called in for intubation as well as stabilization of vital signs. A CT scan of the entire body was performed due to unclear diagnostic focus from previous findings such as head injury possibility or undiagnosed heart disease or gut volvulus (intestinal twist).  The CT scan showed that almost all loops of gastrointestinal tract occupied the right chest cavity with thickening walls indicative of gastrointestinal issues which resulted in partial collapse (atelectasis) of portions within right lower lobe lung. The scan also revealed displacement and distortion within mediastinum blood vessels but no other abdominal organ abnormalities were found.  Based on these findings from CT scan images alone, it became clear that there was diaphragmatic hernia present. Thereafter, emergency measures were taken such as patient transfer to operation theater for exploratory laparotomy surgery after obtaining parental consent.  During surgery through a transverse incision in the right upper abdomen, a defect in the right diaphragm was found. The intestine, including small bowel and colon loops, were gently retracted back into the abdominal cavity through the defect. No signs of strangulation were noted.  While retracting abdominal viscera, approximately 150ml of serous (watery) pleural fluid was aspirated from the right thoracic cavity. A chest tube was inserted to allow for further drainage. The diaphragmatic defect was then closed according to Mayo technique and remaining bowel examined for any abnormalities.  The patient spent 5 days in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in stable condition after surgery. Bowel sounds returned on the second postoperative day and bowel movements occurred on the third day. Endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and extubation took place on same day as well.  During recovery at PICU, nasogastric tube feeding started without difficulties except for two episodes of vomiting over subsequent days. Chest tube removal took place on sixth postoperative day along with discontinuation of intravenous antibiotic administration using a second-generation cephalosporin.  A consultation with a pediatric cardiologist took place due to possible association between diaphragmatic hernias and other congenital anomalies detected during preoperative CT scan evaluation including coronary artery position discrepancies in this case.  At discharge on seventh postoperative day, general condition of the infant remained excellent with no wound infections or difficulty thriving reported even after outpatient follow-ups at 15 days, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively.  As it stands now when this case is reported, this child has experienced full recovery from her operation without any medical problems associated with her surgical history thus far.  In summary: This clinical case involved a child who presented with head injury symptoms but was eventually diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia through CT scan images. The child underwent emergency surgery to correct the diaphragmatic defect and subsequently recovered well without any complications.",explain
"In both of these clinical cases, the patients presented with pain and swelling in the labia majora. Let's break down each case to better understand the symptoms, management, and possible causes.  Clinical Case 1: The patient had no previous history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma. She sought medical care at a nearby health facility where she was hospitalized. The initial treatment involved conservative management with antibiotics and a blood transfusion of 450cc of whole blood. However, her condition worsened with intermittent bleeding and an increase in swelling size.  Upon referral to another health facility, it was noted that she had previously terminated a pregnancy at 8 weeks about 3 years earlier and had given birth vaginally without complications 15 months prior to this current presentation.  The physical exam revealed mild pallor but no tenderness or guarding upon abdominal palpation. However, a large necrotic swelling (measuring 7x6 cm) on the right labia majora was observed. Due to its tense and tender nature, vaginal examination was not possible initially.  To further investigate her condition, a pelvic ultrasound was performed which confirmed proper placement of pelvic organs while also revealing the presence of a hematoma thereby ruling out uterine prolapse. A full blood count indicated that she had normocytic normochromic anemia (9g/dl) while platelet levels were normal.  Vaginal examination/exploration under local anesthesia allowed for debridement followed by applying packed dressing which successfully controlled any further bleeding. Medications administered included antibiotics (ceftriaxone 1g every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 8 hours, gentamycin80mg every12 hours), analgesics (paracetamol1000mg every eight hours), iron tablets supplementation (80mg/day), along with sitz baths and polyvidone iodine for wound care.  The patient was discharged on the third day post-admission and continued with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths. Subsequent follow-up showed no remarkable complications.  Clinical Case 2: In this case, a 17-year-old female presented to the emergency room with sudden-onset pain and rapidly progressing swelling on the left labia majora. The patient reported that she had noticed the swelling just three hours prior to seeking medical attention. Despite taking painkillers (paracetamol, diclofenac), her symptoms were not relieved.  Upon examination, a tense, tender swelling measuring 9x7 cm was observed on the left labia majora with no skin discoloration. As treatment, the swelling was spontaneously ruptured which allowed for drainage of approximately 500cc of clotted blood. The wound was then packed to control any further bleeding.  The patient received prophylactic antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2g) before debridement and also had fluids administered (normal saline and Ringer's lactate) at a rate of 500cc every twelve hours for twenty-four hours. She was discharged from the hospital after two days with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths for ongoing wound care.  While there isn't enough information provided in these cases to establish a definitive diagnosis, healthcare professionals managing these patients would consider several potential causes for their symptoms:  1. Hematoma: In both cases, the large painful swellings are consistent with hematomas - localized collections of blood outside of blood vessels resulting from trauma or bleeding disorders. 2. Trauma: Though no specific trauma history is mentioned in either case, it's possible that minor injuries or activities such as shaving could have contributed to tissue damage leading to hematoma formation. 3. Coagulation Disorders: Although neither patient had reported easy bruising or excessive bleeding previously, underlying clotting disorders may have contributed to the development or persistence of hematomas. 4. Infection: Since both patients were prescribed antibiotics, infection was likely considered as a possible cause for their symptoms. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm or rule out infectious causes.  It's important to note that this analysis is based on the given information and should not replace a healthcare professional's assessment and diagnosis.",explain
"In this clinical case, the patient presented with a painless lesion that had been present for 2 to 3 years. The physical examination was mostly normal, except for some abnormal laboratory findings. The patient did not have any risk factors for HIV infection or chronic disease.  The laboratory results showed pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all types of blood cells. This included normocytic normochromic anemia (low red blood cell count), leucocytopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were elevated, indicating inflammation in the body. Serum Protein Electrophoresis showed abnormal results with hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) and monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (elevated gamma globulins).  Abdomino-pelvic imaging revealed hepatosplenomegaly, which means enlargement of both the liver and spleen. Initially, there were several possible diagnoses considered including brucellosis, typhoid fever, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and hematological malignancies.  Further tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological cultures of blood, stool, and urine were negative ruling out bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Brucella. Hepatitis B Virus tests also came back negative. However, testing for Leishmania antibodies using the Leishmania rk39 immuno-chromatography test was positive.  A bone marrow aspiration was performed and found evidence of Leishmania parasites in amastigote forms. Additionally, serological testing confirmed the presence of Leishmania antibodies in the patient's serum.  Molecular testing using real-time quantitative PCR confirmed a high parasitic load in the blood sample but no amastigotes were seen on direct microscopic examination from skin smears obtained from the lesion. However, Leishmania DNA was detected from dermal DNA extracts using the same PCR technique.  Molecular typing of the isolates showed that both the blood and skin samples corresponded to L. infantum species. With these findings, a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was made, and treatment with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate was initiated.  During treatment, the patient developed mild renal failure but recovered after adjusting the dose of amphotericin B and providing rehydration. The treatment response was favorable as fever resolved, fatigue improved, appetite increased, and splenomegaly resolved. Blood counts returned to normal ranges with negative real-time PCR results after 28 days of treatment.  However, despite improvement in other symptoms and negative PCR results in blood samples for Leishmania parasites, the skin lesion did not improve over time. A polarized dermoscopy examination revealed characteristics suggestive of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The patient initially refused a skin biopsy but eventually accepted it after a year.  Histopathology examination of the skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The tumor was completely excised leading to good recovery without any complications.  In summary, this clinical case initially presented as an unclear etiology with symptoms suggesting VL based on laboratory findings and imaging results. However; further investigation including molecular testing established a diagnosis of VL along with positive serological tests for Leishmania antibodies. Treatment with anti-leishmanial therapy led to resolution or improvement in most symptoms except for an unremitting skin lesion which turned out to be unrelated to VL but rather a basal cell carcinoma requiring surgical intervention for complete resolution.

"In this clinical case, a patient presented with several concerning symptoms and findings that required further investigation and management. The initial assessment showed that the patient did not have a fever (apyretic) but had evidence of metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Additionally, the patient had low potassium levels (hypokalaemia) and normal lactate levels. Despite absence of ketone bodies on urine dipstick test, the diagnosis of diabetes decompensation was made.  The first step in treatment involved conditioning the patient and implementing a hydration regimen to correct hypokalaemia along with insulin therapy for diabetes management. However, due to non-improvement in the patient's neurological condition, they were referred to intensive care for additional management.  Further investigations were performed to determine possible causes for the worsening neurological state. A brain scan revealed multiple parietal ischemic foci (areas of reduced blood supply), indicating potential cerebral issues that could be contributing to symptoms. A chest scanner also showed thickening of the septum (the wall between heart chambers) and bronchial dilation without signs of COVID-19 related lung infection. An abdominal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities.  Additional diagnostic tests were conducted including an electrocardiogram which showed no electrical signs of hypokalaemia or repolarization disturbances, as well as other imaging studies like transthoracic echocardiography (normal), and ultrasound examination of supraortic trunks (normal).  Laboratory findings included an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level indicating inflammation but negative procalcitonin levels ruling out serious bacterial infection. The white blood cell count was slightly raised with elevated neutrophils (PNN – polymorphonuclear neutrophils), low lymphocytes count within normal range, no thrombocytopenia or abnormalities in ferritin concentration or fibrinogen levels.  Importantly, testing for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs and COVID-19 serology (IgM and IgG) were both negative, indicating that COVID-19 infection was not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms.  Due to the presence of ischemic lesions in the brain scan, prophylactic anticoagulation, antiplatelet aggregation with aspirin, statins for cholesterol control and antibiotic therapy at a meningeal dose with ceftriaxone were initiated. Lumbar puncture was performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which showed elevated protein levels but normal glucose levels. Bacterial culture from CSF was negative after 24 hours of incubation.  On day 2 of admission, a cerebral magnetic resonance angiography showed signs suggesting vascular leukopathy (a condition affecting blood vessels in the brain), along with calcifications in basal ganglia (brain structures involved in movement control) and cortical atrophy. Electroencephalogram findings indicated epilepsy-like signs which led to the diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycemia-related epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsant treatment with sodium valproate was started.  Despite efforts to correct metabolic acidosis and manage comorbidities, including intubation on day 3 of admission due to worsening neurological status, there was no progressive lesion observed on a cerebral computerized tomography scan.  As lymphopenia (reduced lymphocyte count) developed along with increased CRP levels, further tests were conducted. Multiplex RT-PCR performed on samples obtained from distal bronchial regions as well as CSF revealed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF confirmed its presence but had a high cycle threshold indicating low viral load. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalopathy was made.  The patient remains in the intensive care unit, receiving ongoing medical care and support.  In summary, this clinical case presented a patient with various complex symptoms and findings. The initial diagnosis of diabetes decompensation was made despite the absence of ketone bodies. Further investigations revealed cerebral ischemic foci, signs of vascular leukopathy, and epileptic seizures. Although COVID-19 infection seemed unlikely at first due to negative RT-PCR and serology results, later testing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presence in CSF with high CT values suggesting a low viral load.

"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with various symptoms and laboratory findings that led to a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis class III, anti-phospholipid syndrome, and primary hyperparathyroidism.  The initial blood count showed low hemoglobin levels (9g/dl) and slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at 85 µ3. Lymphopenia was also observed (400/mm3), while platelets remained within the normal range (450,000/mm3). The direct Coombs test was negative, indicating the absence of red blood cell antibodies. Additional laboratory results revealed low serum albumin levels (25g/l), low total protein levels (50g/l), proteinuria at 3.2g/day, and normal creatinine levels.  Autoimmune markers were assessed in this patient to further investigate the underlying cause of her symptoms. The anti-nuclear antibody panel showed positivity for ANA at a titer of 1/320 with a homogeneous pattern. Anti-dsDNA level was elevated at 160U/ml, indicating the presence of specific antibodies associated with SLE. Furthermore, anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were detected at a positive level of 25UGPL.  Complement fractions C3 and C4 were found to be low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l), suggesting complement activation commonly seen in autoimmune conditions such as SLE.  Imaging studies played an important role in diagnosing this patient's condition. A chest computed tomography scan revealed proximal pulmonary embolism – a potentially life-threatening complication associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. On the other hand, renal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities.  A renal biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis characterized by immunocomplex deposition with segmental mesangial proliferation – indicative of mild activity according to the World Health Organization's classification of lupus nephritis (class III A/C).  In addition to symptoms related to SLE and lupus nephritis, the patient also exhibited features suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. Elevated serum calcium levels (132 mg/l) and hypercalciuria (479 mg/24 h) were observed. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were also significantly elevated at 628 pg/ml.  Further investigations revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm on CT scan and ultrasound imaging – confirming the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.  The combination of lupus nephritis, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis led to therapeutic interventions targeting each condition. The patient received a pulse of methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone as well as intravenous cyclophosphamide for treatment of lupus nephritis. Maintenance therapy included mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine.  For the pulmonary embolism associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin was initiated followed by antivitamin K therapy.  To address severe hypercalcemia caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, intravenous fluids alongside furosemide were administered before surgical removal of the affected parathyroid gland. Histopathological examination confirmed a parathyroid adenoma.  Following surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia characterized by oral paresthesia – a common complication seen after successful removal of a diseased parathyroid gland. Oral calcium supplementation was required for several months until her calcium levels stabilized.  During her four-year follow-up period, no relapses or significant symptoms related to SLE were observed. Control over proteinuria was achieved without corticosteroid use post-operatively.  In conclusion, this complex clinical case illustrates how multiple conditions such as SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and primary hyperparathyroidism can coexist. A multidimensional treatment approach involving immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulation therapy, surgical intervention for hyperparathyroidism, and supportive measures effectively managed the patient's condition without significant complications. Regular monitoring and follow-up aided in the successful management of her long-term care.",explain
"Title: A Case of Talar Osteomyelitis and Septic Arthritis  Introduction: This clinical case describes the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a patient with talar osteomyelitis (bone infection) and septic arthritis (joint infection). Understanding this case is crucial to highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis, early intervention, and appropriate antibiotic therapy in managing such infections.  Case Presentation: The patient presented with aggravated symptoms including ankle edema, warmth on palpation, diffuse tenderness, and high fever (39°C). Initial diagnostic assessments revealed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dl), elevated white blood cell count (18800/mm^3), increased C-reactive protein levels (75 mm/hr), as well as other elevated serum laboratory markers. Although a computed tomography scan showed a fracture of the talus bone in the ankle joint region, talar osteomyelitis with septic arthritis was still suspected based on clinical findings.  Diagnostic Assessment: Further investigations included an X-ray which displayed a lytic lesion on the posterior-medial aspect of the talus along with soft tissue swelling surrounding the ankle joint. Bone scintigraphy confirmed septic arthritis and bone marrow edema without allowing for an accurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, magnetic resonance imaging was unavailable at that time.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given urgent circumstances to manage this patient's condition promptly, he underwent surgery where exploration of the ankle joint through an anterior approach enabled visualization of false membranes along with turbid fluid accumulation at the junction between bone cartilage in the talus. An opening into this cavity led to drainage and removal of fibrinous pus. Biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological examination and culture testing at that site. Curettage followed by irrigation were performed before closure using suction drains.  Follow-up & Outcomes: At first three days post-surgery, febrile peaks persisted. However, blood culture and joint specimen tests isolated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Anatomopathological analysis of the ankle specimen highlighted abscess formation and hyperplastic synovial cells. As a result, intravenous antibiotic treatment was modified and teicoplanin was initiated. Following drainage maintenance for twelve days (until normalization of C-reactive protein), intravenous antibiotics were continued for three weeks. By the third week, peripheral leukocyte count decreased to 8600/mL, and C-reactive protein levels significantly dropped to 2.43mg.  Sustained Progress: Antibiotics were then shifted to oral pristinamycin for three weeks as inflammatory markers continued to decrease in the fourth week (erythrocyte sedimentation rate-7 mm/hr; C-reactive protein-3 mg/L). In terms of patient outcomes, no pain or limitations in ankle mobility were reported during follow-up visits at six months and eighteen months postoperatively. Radiographic imaging at six months displayed complete healing of the lesion.  Discussion: This clinical case highlights how prompt diagnosis along with aggressive surgical intervention, appropriate antibiotic therapy targeted against MRSA infection, followed by careful monitoring can yield favorable outcomes.  Conclusion: Talar osteomyelitis associated with septic arthritis is a serious condition that warrants urgent medical attention due to its potential complications such as joint destruction if left untreated. Close follow-up with appropriate diagnostic modalities like imaging studies is crucial to guide surgical interventions when required. The successful management in this case emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary approaches involving surgeons, infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, nurses - all working together towards optimal patient care and recovery.

"Case N°1:  In this clinical case, the patient presented with symptoms that initially did not suggest COVID-19 infection. However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient had a positive PCR test for COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels, indicating potential coagulation abnormalities.  The patient also experienced repeated paroxysmal seizures without returning to normal consciousness between seizures, which led to a diagnosis of status epilepticus. The electroencephalogram (EEG) performed during the intercritical phase revealed theta activity and epileptogenic graphoelements suggestive of multifocal epilepsy.  The patient received treatment according to the protocol for managing status epilepticus including Clonazepam, Phenobarbital infusion, and Thiopental as recommended by the neurologist. A brain CT scan did not show any specific abnormalities.  After the confirmation of COVID-19 infection and discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate due to recurrent seizures, corticosteroid therapy was initiated along with symptomatic management. The patient remained seizure-free for one month before being discharged under neurologist's prescription.  Case N°2:  In this case involving an 11-year-old patient who was being treated with chloroquine sulfate for confirmed COVID-19 infection, loss of consciousness occurred along with generalized tonic-clonic seizure and other associated symptoms such as tongue biting and loss of urine control. The clinical examination revealed respiratory distress but no fever.  The neurological examination showed persistent mental confusion for more than an hour during the intercritical phase. Metabolic balance sheet results were within normal limits but there were indications of a non-specific inflammatory syndrome in other biological parameters. An electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated a heart rhythm disorder.  Urgent brain CT scan or intracranial EEG was not performed at this stage due to limited availability. Chloroquine sulfate was discontinued while clonazepam IV benzodiazepine was initiated as needed. Background antiepileptic treatment (levetiracetam) was also started following the second seizure.  After recovery from COVID-19 infection and being seizure-free for three weeks, a brain scan and EEG were performed, which showed normal results. The patient was discharged with a recommendation for neurological surveillance.  Case N°3:  In this case, a 16-year-old patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was receiving treatment with chloroquine sulfate experienced loss of consciousness accompanied by Bravais Jacksonian clonic seizures on the right side of the body. There was no personal or family history of epilepsy.  The clinical examination did not reveal any notable findings apart from focal epilepsy with rolandic paroxysm. The metabolic assessment showed normal results while other biological parameters indicated a non-specific inflammatory syndrome.  Similar to previous cases, chloroquine sulfate was discontinued and clonazepam IV benzodiazepine was initiated as needed. Following a repeat attack after chloroquine discontinuation, levetiracetam treatment was instituted. The patient remained seizure-free for 16 days before discharge with two negative RT-PCR tests.  Post-recovery brain CT scan and EEG detected no abnormalities in this case as well.  These three cases demonstrate various neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection in different age groups without prior history of epilepsy. While some patients experienced status epilepticus or generalized seizures, others had focal seizures or epileptiform activity detected on EEG recordings.  Management involved discontinuing chloroquine sulfate due to its potential role in triggering or exacerbating seizures and initiating appropriate antiepileptic medications based on the type of seizures observed. Symptomatic management along with corticosteroid therapy were provided when necessary in order to control inflammation caused by COVID-19 infection.  Long-term follow-up is important to monitor any potential recurrence of seizures or other neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection in these cases.",explain
"This clinical case describes a newborn baby who was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit due to health concerns. The initial echocardiography showed mild-moderate pulmonary hypertension with no structural heart defects. Subsequent blood work revealed low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, indicating anemia and thrombocytopenia. The direct Coomb's test was positive, suggesting Rh incompatibility.  Rh incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive, resulting in the production of antibodies by the mother against the baby's red blood cells. In this case, the mother had a previous pregnancy with an O positive baby while she herself has O negative blood type. It was noted that anti-D antibody testing was not performed during this pregnancy and intrauterine blood transfusion was not given to the fetus.  As a treatment for Rh incompatibility, Rho (D) immunoglobulin (a medication that prevents sensitization of Rh-negative individuals to Rh-positive red blood cells) was administered to the mother after her previous delivery as well as during this pregnancy at 32 weeks gestation. However, despite these measures, the newborn still experienced complications related to hemolytic disease of the newborn.  The baby received several transfusions of packed red cells and underwent an exchange transfusion (a procedure where some of their blood is removed and replaced with donor blood) to stabilize their condition. They were also given antibiotics to prevent infection.  During their hospital stay, it was observed that liver transaminases (AST and ALT) were elevated along with increased bilirubin levels indicating cholestatic jaundice (a type of jaundice caused by impaired bile flow). Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered as a short-term treatment for cholestatic jaundice.  The platelet count initially decreased but eventually normalized without requiring platelet transfusions. Reticulocyte count (immature red blood cells) initially increased but later became inappropriately low compared to hemoglobin levels upon discharge. Elevated serum ferritin levels were attributed to repeated blood transfusions.  The baby was discharged from the hospital after 20 days, with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and was scheduled for weekly follow-up appointments. However, at 30 days of age, they were hospitalized again due to anemia and received another packed red cell transfusion.  Since the baby's reticulocyte count remained consistently low with persistent anemia despite transfusions, a bone marrow biopsy was performed to investigate further. The biopsy showed normal cellularity and a diagnosis of hyporegenerative anemia secondary to Rh incompatibility was made.  In order to stimulate the production of red blood cells, recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that regulates red blood cell production, was initiated as treatment on day 32 of life. Over three weeks of EPO treatment, the reticulocyte count increased and stabilized their hemoglobin level.  The EPO treatment was discontinued after four weeks when reticulocyte count reached 1.2%. Subsequently, another transfusion was required after ten days due to decreased hemoglobin levels. Continuing monitoring showed improvement with decreasing bilirubin and ferritin levels over time.  Various investigations were done throughout this case's course including TANDEM mass spectrometry testing for metabolic disorders (negative results), serological tests for infectious diseases (negative results), endocrine work-up (normal results), coagulation profile assessment (normal results), abdominal ultrasound examination (normal results). None revealed any abnormal findings regarding other possible causes for elevated bilirubin or liver dysfunction except Rh incompatibility-related anemia.  At four months old, both bilirubin and ferritin levels normalized while liver function markers normalized at one year. Chelation therapy, a treatment used to remove excess iron from the body, was not needed in this case.  Long-term follow-up showed that the baby achieved normal developmental milestones by 12 months of age.",explain
"In this clinical case, we are presented with two patients, both siblings, who have similar dental and nail abnormalities.  The first patient is a young girl whose nails were small and discolored at birth but improved with age. She also has missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth and severe attrition. Generalized pit and fissure caries were found on all the posterior teeth, as well as deep caries on the left maxillary anterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori (bony growths in the roof of the mouth) were noticed, along with poor gingival and periodontal condition. The oral mucosa appeared normal.  Upon investigation through a panoramic radiograph, it was confirmed that there was periapical infection in the right maxillary anterior teeth and generalized absence of permanent tooth bud in both the maxillary and mandibular arches.  The second patient is a 14-year-old girl who is also a sibling of the first patient. She has similar nail abnormalities to her elder sister, including spoon-shaped slow-growing small fragile fingernails with onychorrhexis (brittle nails) and deformed toenails. Like her sister, she also has missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth. Generalized pit and fissure caries was observed on posterior teeth along with deep caries on right mandibular posterior teeth. Poor periodontal condition characterized by generalized stains and calculus was noted as well. The oral mucosa appeared normal.  A panoramic radiograph was obtained for this patient as well, which showed generalized absence of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arches.  Based on family history, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of partial anodontia (absence or lack of development of some permanent teeth) was given considering mesoectodermal dysplasia (a genetic disorder affecting tissues derived from embryonic mesoderm and ectoderm), ectodermal dysplasia (a group of genetic disorders affecting the hair, nails, teeth, sweat glands, and skin), and tooth and nail syndrome (a condition characterized by nail dysplasia with hypodontia or missing teeth) as differential diagnoses.  Genetic investigation was conducted on both patients to further understand the underlying cause. DNA extraction was performed using blood samples collected from the patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using a standard kit. Sanger sequencing was then performed to validate the identified mutation in the MSX1 gene.  MSX1 is a vital gene involved in tooth development. The DNA sequences were analyzed and compared with a reference using alignment software, while chromatograms were viewed and analyzed for mutations. A point mutation on exon 1 of MSX1 (1A;c.731G > A) was observed in both patients.  The result of this study suggests that MSX1 gene variants are contributing to familial hypodontia in these two siblings. However, it is important to note that while MSX1 mutation may play a role, there could be other genes and mutations that are more predominant factors contributing to hypodontia in these patients. Further analysis through whole exome or whole genome sequencing of patient samples could help identify additional genetic factors involved.  In conclusion, this clinical case presents two siblings with similar dental abnormalities including missing permanent teeth along with nail abnormalities such as small size and discoloration at birth. Genetic investigation revealed a mutation in the MSX1 gene which is associated with tooth development but may not be solely responsible for the phenotype observed in these patients. ",explain
"Title: Marfan Syndrome - A Case Study  Introduction: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue and can have serious implications on multiple organ systems. The following case study presents a patient with typical features of MFS and highlights some of the clinical manifestations commonly associated with the condition.  Patient Presentation: The patient, without a family history of similar problems, visited the hospital to determine if he indeed had MFS based on his own internet research. On general examination, it was observed that he was exceptionally tall (2.1 meters) and thin, which are characteristic physical traits associated with MFS. Additional musculoskeletal features were identified during examination, including arachnodactyly (abnormally long fingers), pectus carinatum deformity (protrusion of the chest bone), hind foot valgus (ankle deformity), dolichostenomelia (disproportionately long limbs), scoliosis (spine curvature), dolichocephaly (long head shape), enophthalmos (sunken eyes), downslanting palpebral fissures ('droopy' eyelids), malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped cheekbones), and retrognathia (recessed jaw).   Furthermore, detailed assessment using the revised Ghent nosology scoring system confirmed a total systemic score of 10, supporting the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Cardiovascular Findings: The patient's cardiovascular evaluation revealed soft first heart sounds along with a grade 4/5 murmur indicative of mitral regurgitation. While there were no signs suggestive of infective endocarditis or cardiac failure at this stage, echocardiography demonstrated prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet accompanied by moderately severe mitral regurgitation. The examination also revealed dilation in both the aortic root and sinuses.  Ophthalmologic Findings: An ophthalmologic examination conducted by a specialist identified a dense cataract in the left eye with lens subluxation (partial displacement), but no dislocation. The right eye exhibited iridodonesis (trembling of the iris) and myopia, but no evident lens subluxation or dislocation.  Radiographic Findings: Chest X-ray results showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, which indicated an enlarged heart. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed dilation of the aortic root and sinuses resulting in ascending thoracic aorta enlargement. A suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was also observed; however, it displayed no signs of dissection, thrombi formation, or imminent rupture.  Additional Observations: The patient presented with dual blood supply to the right kidney: one artery arising from the inferior aspect of the aneurysm and another originating from the normal abdominal aorta inferiorly. The left renal artery, on the other hand, arose solely from within the aneurysm. Additionally, CT findings indicated that both coeliac axis (supplying blood to abdominal organs) and superior mesenteric arteries originated from within the abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Final Assessment and Treatment Options: Given these clinical findings, surgical intervention was recommended for mitral valve repair/replacement as well as addressing his dilated ascending thoracic aorta. However, after thorough consultation with his family, he chose to decline surgical intervention.  Conclusion: This case presentation highlights typical clinical manifestations associated with Marfan syndrome. It underscores features such as musculoskeletal abnormalities including arachnodactyly and pectus carinatum deformity along with cardiovascular implications like mitral regurgitation and dilated thoracic vessels. Ophthalmological evaluations revealed lens abnormalities while radiographic investigations unveiled significant vascular dilation. Effective management strategies often involve a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing various medical specialties to assess and address specific organ system involvement. Genetic counseling is also crucial to explain the inheritance patterns of MFS, as early diagnosis and subsequent monitoring play vital roles in minimizing potential complications and improving patient outcomes.",explain
"In these two clinical cases, we see infants presenting with a condition known as aplasia cutis congenita. Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare disorder characterized by the absence of skin at birth. It can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly affects the scalp.   Case 1 involves a baby with a large defect on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. In addition to this scalp defect, the baby also presented with low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle (soft spot on top of the head), and respiratory distress. These symptoms raised concerns for possible meningitis in this case.  The diagnostic process included physical examination and imaging techniques such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI revealed an absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from behind the anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle. The brain structures were normal in morphology and signal intensity.  Treatment for this case involved routine care protocols including oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, antibiotics at meningitis doses due to suspicion of infection, and wound dressing with sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. The baby responded well to treatment; respiratory distress subsided, oral feeds were tolerated well, and multidisciplinary team management involving neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons was implemented.  In preparation for future intervention to cover up the scalp defect through autologous skin grafting using flap cover procedures developed by burns and plastic unit specialists along with neurosurgeons consultation.   Case 2 involves another infant presenting with aplasia cutis congenita; however additional complications were present including desquamating or peeling skin epidermal structures like nails not being fully developed . There was also a midline subcutaneous tissue defect extending from frontal area all way back till right parietal region that caused cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The infant was febrile, cyanosed, hypertonic and a heart murmur was detected.  In this case, there were financial constraints preventing further diagnostic investigations such as brain MRI, echocardiography and chromosomal studies. The patient required treatment with parenteral antibiotics to address the meningitis that was likely present. Wound care included daily cleaning and dressing with betadine.  The infant experienced complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis which resolved over time with appropriate treatment. Plans were made for future intervention involving the use of prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover by burns and plastic unit specialists.  While these cases share the common feature of aplasia cutis congenita causing scalp defects, they also highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving specialized physicians from various fields such as neurosurgery, plastic surgery, neonatology along with nurses to provide comprehensive care to these infants.  It is essential for healthcare providers to maintain open lines of communication with families affected by aplasia cutis congenita in order to understand their concerns and provide appropriate support throughout the diagnostic process and subsequent management. Additionally, healthcare professionals must be aware of potential complications associated with this condition that may require prompt intervention to prevent further morbidity or mortality.  In both cases, we see infants who presented with aplasia cutis congenita, a condition characterized by the absence of skin at birth. This condition can have various causes, including genetic factors, vascular abnormalities during fetal development, and exposure to certain medications or toxins during pregnancy.  In Case 1, the baby had a large defect on the scalp that was well-demarcated and irregularly shaped. The presence of a yellow layer of membrane covering the defect suggests the formation of granulation tissue or connective tissue filling in the area where skin is absent. The baby also had physical features such as low set ears and an irritable disposition.  Aplasia cutis congenita can present as an isolated finding or in association with other congenital abnormalities or syndromes. In this case, meningitis was also suspected due to symptoms like irritability and tense anterior fontanelle. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually caused by infections.  To confirm a diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita and determine its extent, imaging studies were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that there was an absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from behind anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle without involvement into vital underlying brain structures.  Treatment for this case involved providing supportive care to ensure proper hydration with intravenous fluids while addressing potential infection through antibiotic therapy at doses appropriate for treating meningitis. Wound dressing included using sofra-tulle along with normal saline-soaked gauze for optimal wound healing conditions.  A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons was implemented to plan future interventions for closing the scalp defects through autologous skin grafting using flap cover procedures developed by specialized burn units.  In Case 2, similar concerns arose regarding aplasia cutis congenita due to observed subcutaneous tissue defects in multiple areas of the scalp. In addition to this, the baby presented with other anomalies such as desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a cardiac murmur suggesting congenital heart disease.  Further investigations were limited due to financial constraints; however, appropriate treatment was administered based on clinical findings. Parenteral antibiotics were given to address the suspected meningitis caused by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection. Wound care involved regular cleaning and dressing with betadine.  Complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis were managed during the hospital stay until discharge. Plans for future interventions involving prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover were made by burns and plastic surgery specialists.  It is important to note that while both cases presented aplasia cutis congenita as a main finding, Case 2 also included multiple other congenital anomalies. The presence of additional anomalies suggests the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder or syndrome predisposing these infants to multiple abnormalities.  In conclusion, aplasia cutis congenita is a rare condition where infants are born with skin defects typically affecting the scalp but can occur elsewhere on the body. It can present as an isolated finding or in association with other abnormalities or syndromes. Accurate diagnosis through physical examination and imaging studies helps guide treatment decisions involving wound care protocols in preparation for future interventions aimed at closing scalp defects. Multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in ensuring comprehensive management for these infants affected by aplasia cutis congenita. ",explain
"In these clinical cases, we see the potential impact of self-medication and delayed diagnosis on the transmission and spread of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and Ebola virus disease. Each case highlights different aspects of the challenges faced in diagnosing and managing these illnesses in a resource-limited setting.  In the first case, we have an 18-year-old woman who initially presented with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated malaria. However, instead of seeking medical care at a healthcare facility, she chose to self-medicate with antimalarial drugs along with antibiotics and analgesics. This decision resulted in her symptoms disappearing after three days without proper evaluation or admission into an Ebola treatment center (ETC). It is important to note that self-medication can be dangerous as it may lead to incorrect or incomplete treatment which can further complicate the patient's condition.  The second case involves a 7-month-old infant who exhibited symptoms of fever and diarrhea. The initial diagnosis was malaria and acute gastroenteritis. Unfortunately, his condition worsened over time, manifesting as hematemesis (vomiting blood). The baby was then transferred to a designated Ebola treatment center where he tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR but sadly died on the same day. This tragic case reveals how unrecognized early signs could be indicative of more serious conditions like Ebola virus disease.  Furthermore, both parents were found to have antibodies against Ebola using serological tests despite testing negative through RT-PCR at that point in time indicating that they had been exposed to the virus but were not actively infected at that specific moment. It is crucial for individuals who have been exposed or experienced symptoms related to infectious diseases like Ebola to undergo proper testing even if their initial tests come back negative.  The third case illustrates fear-driven behavior during an epidemic outbreak leading individuals to hide from contact tracing teams out of fear rather than seeking appropriate medical attention promptly. Both AB and ZM experienced symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease, including fever, headache, joint pain, and physical asthenia. AB initially sought outpatient care from a cardiology department where he was given antimalarial treatment along with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. It was only when his symptoms persisted that he visited a traditional healer before eventually being located by the contact tracing team. On the other hand, ZM promptly sought admission to an ETC after presenting with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Both individuals tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR.  In these cases, it is noteworthy that despite the potential for transmission to close contacts due to shared living spaces and promiscuity within households or communities such as in the third case mentioned above; no further spread occurred within any of these contact networks. This may suggest that timely identification of cases through contact tracing efforts can effectively mitigate further disease transmission.  It is essential to emphasize the importance of seeking proper medical care instead of self-medication during outbreaks or when experiencing symptoms related to infectious diseases like malaria or Ebola virus disease. Early diagnosis enables appropriate management strategies which are essential not only for individual patient outcomes but also for overall public health efforts aimed at controlling and preventing further spread of diseases within communities.  In conclusion, these clinical cases serve as reminders of the critical role healthcare facilities play in identifying and managing infections like malaria, typhoid fever, and Ebola virus disease effectively. They also highlight how delays in diagnosis or reluctance to seek medical care can contribute to increased transmission risks within families and communities during epidemic situations.

"Clinical Case 1: This clinical case involves a patient who presented with certain laboratory findings and underwent multiple surgeries. The initial presentation was characterized by leukocytosis (an increase in the number of white blood cells) with neutrophilia (an increase in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) and normal platelet counts. The levels of urea, creatinine, and electrolytes were within normal limits, indicating no significant impairment in kidney function.  After resuscitation, the patient underwent a laparotomy (surgical procedure involving the opening of the abdominal cavity) due to fecal matter leakage from two sites where anastomosis from previous surgeries had been performed. During this surgery, segments of the bowel that were leaking were removed (resected), and an abdominal washout was conducted to clean soiled areas within the peritoneal cavity. An ileostomy was created as part of further surgical intervention.  However, extensive bowel edema made it impossible to achieve fascial closure during surgery. Fascial closure refers to suturing or closing layers of connective tissue surrounding muscles for proper wound healing. Instead, a temporary abdominal closure technique called Bogotá bag was employed for temporary abdominal compartment syndrome treatment (TAC). The Bogotá bag is typically fashioned out of either using recommissioned catheter drainage bags or intravenous fluid bags.  Due to limited space availability in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), the patient's post-operative care continued on a general surgical ward. Throughout his hospital stay, he underwent multiple re-look laparotomies with abdominal washouts due to abscesses formation in his abdomen. Additionally, one laparotomy was performed because there was colonic perforation at his hepatic flexure necessitating a right colectomy.  For fluid administration and antibiotic therapy purposes during treatment phases such as resuscitation or post-operative care, a central venous catheter was inserted. A Foley catheter was used to monitor the patient's urine output, and routine stoma care was provided through the usage of a stoma bag (a specialized bag to collect waste from ileostomy or colostomy). Enteral feeds (nutrition administered through the gastrointestinal tract) were initiated early and maintained throughout his hospital stay, despite him becoming cachectic (experiencing extreme weight loss), with his weight at one point being as low as 37 kilograms.  Despite the challenges associated with caring for an open abdomen in conjunction with an adjacent ileostomy, such as increased risk of complications like entero-atmospheric fistula formation (abnormal connection between the intestine and surrounding atmosphere), this particular patient did not develop such a complication. After spending a total of 121 days in the hospital and achieving adequate weight gain along with contracture of his abdominal wound, he was discharged.  Clinical Case 2: This clinical case involves a young man who presented to MTRH (name or abbreviation not elaborated) with acute upper abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting and abdominal distension. While he had no remarkable blood counts, laboratory findings included azotemia (increase in nitrogenous compounds in blood), hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). An abdominal x-ray revealed air under his right hemidiaphragm.  After initial fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, surgery was performed due to suspicion of perforated viscus. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity during surgery, more than 2 liters of succus entericus were found emanating from a gastric wall perforation. A biopsy sample was obtained during surgery for further evaluation, followed by using an omental patch repair technique called Graham patch to close the gastric defect.  However, extensive bowel edema prevented fascial closure once again during surgery necessitating the usage of a Bogotá bag for TAC. The patient remained stable after surgery, and a second-look laparotomy was performed 48 hours later. During this surgery, it was observed that the gastric repair was intact, bowel edema had subsided, and fascial closure could be successfully achieved.  Following his positive outcome in surgery, the patient was discharged a week later and prescribed a proton pump inhibitor medication to reduce stomach acid levels. At the follow-up clinic appointment, histology results indicated benign findings with no further pathological concerns noted. The patient remained symptom-free throughout his subsequent follow-up visits.  In conclusion, these two clinical cases illustrate complex surgical interventions that required temporary abdominal closure due to extensive bowel edema compromising fascial closure. Despite their challenges and associated complications during post-operative care periods, both patients achieved positive outcomes in terms of wound healing and recovery.  Word Count: 675",explain
"Title: Hemangioblastoma: A Case of Treatment and Recovery  Introduction:  This clinical case revolves around a patient presenting with a balance disorder, accompanied by the inability to walk or stand unaided. Further diagnostics revealed the presence of a cerebellar tumor, primarily composed of fleshy and cystic components. The initial surgical attempt was only partially successful due to the deep localization and potential risks. Subsequently, radiotherapy was recommended as an alternative treatment option. This article aims to shed light on the diagnosis, management, treatment approach, and post-therapy outcomes in a patient with hemangioblastoma.  Clinical Presentation:  At the neurological examination, the patient exhibited symptoms such as widened sustentation polygon (a measure of balance assessment), an inability to walk without assistance (heeling gait), and standing difficulties necessitating support. Notably, no sensory or motor deficits or cognitive impairments were observed during evaluation. Ophthalmological examination indicated that the patient maintained visual acuity at 8/10 with normal fundus findings.  Diagnostic Findings:  Laboratory evaluations including complete blood count, electrolytes, and basic metabolic profile did not reveal any abnormalities within standard reference ranges. Brain CT scan demonstrated a cerebellar tumor process consisting of both fleshy and cystic components measuring 70 mm in diameter. This mass exerted compression on the fourth ventricle leading to significant tri-ventricular hydrocephalus and signs of trans-ependymal resorption of cerebrospinal fluid.  Further investigation through cerebral MRI revealed a solido-cystic cerebellar tumor measuring 70*57*60 mm indicative of a pilocytic astrocytoma resulting in tonsillar involvement.  Surgical Intervention:  Although surgical removal was planned for optimal management, it could only be partially completed due to deep-seated localization within sensitive brain regions associated with potential hemorrhagic risks during operation.  Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis as hemangioblastoma, a highly vascular benign tumor originating from blood vessels.  Evaluation for Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome:  Considering the nature of the tumor, a whole-body CT scan was performed to evaluate any possible associated lesions related to Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Both pancreatic, renal, and adrenal processes were examined; however, no detectable abnormalities were found in alignment with negative findings from an earlier fundus examination. Thus, it was concluded that Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome was unlikely in this patient.  Radiotherapy Treatment:  Given the partial nature of surgical removal and persistent clinical symptoms, radiotherapy became an integral part of treatment. The patient received three-dimensional conformal external radiotherapy with a total dose of 50.4Gy delivered in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks. Daily treatment involved a fraction dose of 1.8Gy delivered once per day across five sessions per week.  Radiation planning aimed to reduce radiation exposure to critical structures such as the brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerves, retina, and pituitary gland while simultaneously delivering optimal radiation doses to effectively target the tumor site using 6-MV photons via conformal techniques guided by computed tomography imaging (3D conformal radiotherapy).  Treatment Outcome and Post-Radiotherapy Evaluation:  The administered radiotherapy demonstrated good tolerance by the patient throughout its course with no significant side effects except for mild grade I alopecia (hair loss). In parallel with weekly evaluations during treatment by medical professionals responsible for care continuity and monitoring side effects or complications associated with therapy administration,  Remarkably positive improvements were observed after one month post-radiotherapy completion despite partial surgical removal: balance improved significantly without occurrence of nausea or vomiting symptoms along with enhanced visual acuity – indicating a successful therapeutic response.  Three months after radiation therapy completion; cerebral MRI performed on the patient showed a decrease in the size of the cerebellar process, indicating tumor shrinkage and response to treatment.  Conclusion:  This clinical case highlights the challenges faced in managing deep-seated cerebellar tumors. Despite a suboptimal surgical outcome, complementary treatment through three-dimensional conformal external radiotherapy proved effective and well-tolerated by the patient. The positive response was demonstrated by outcomes such as improved balance, visual acuity, and reduction in tumor size as seen on follow-up imaging.  Successful multidisciplinary collaboration between neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, and other healthcare professionals played an essential role in both diagnosing and treating this complex case. Continual monitoring of post-therapy progress remains crucial to allow early detection of any possible recurrence or further intervention requirements.",explain
"Title: Unveiling the Intersection of Cryptococcus Meningoencephalitis and IgA-λ Multiple Myeloma: A Clinical Case  Introduction: In this clinical case, we present a patient with seemingly contradictory symptoms - a neurological presentation featuring bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve and bilateral hypo-acousia, alongside laboratory findings suggestive of immunodeficiency. The subsequent diagnosis revealed the coexistence of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis and IgA-λ multiple myeloma.  Clinical Presentation: The physical examination unveiled a temperature recording of 38.5°C. The neurologic examination indicated that the patient was conscious, well oriented in space and time, without any signs of meningeal or vestibular syndrome. However, bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve and hypo-acousia were identified. Notably, there were no sensori-motor deficits or other localizing neurological signs.  Laboratory Findings: The basic metabolic panel displayed several abnormalities warranting further investigation - elevated C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count), hyper-fibrinogenemia (high fibrinogen levels), and anemia. Additionally, an eye fundus examination revealed stage I papilledema bilaterally.  Diagnostic Investigations: Cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any significant abnormalities related to the patient's symptoms. However, an audiogram exhibited bilateral perceptive deafness. Subsequent lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure along with analyzed abnormalities such as increased white blood cell count mainly consisting of lymphocytes.  Cryptococcus Detection: India ink staining detected Cryptococcus in CSF samples while serum testing for cryptococcal antigens returned positive results for both blood and CSF cultures confirmed by the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans. Sensitivity testing was also performed to determine the most effective antifungal therapy.  Immunodeficiency Evaluation: Given the unusual occurrence of Cryptococcus infection in an immunocompetent patient, investigating potential causes of immunodeficiency became important. Serological tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. However, serum protein electrophoresis indicated hypo-albuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia.  Multiple Myeloma Diagnosis:  The presence of monoclonal IgA-λ paraproteinemia along with Bence Jones proteinuria suggested the existence of IgA-lambda type multiple myeloma. Further laboratory analysis exhibited abnormal levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations, with a substantial elevation in lambda chains compared to kappa chains.  Confirmation and Management: Bone marrow aspiration confirmed plasma cell infiltration exceeding 10%, confirming multiple myeloma diagnosis based on International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria. To manage this condition, the patient received amphotericin B combined with flucytosine as treatment for Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis. Reduction of CSF pressure was achieved through repeated drainage during induction treatment followed by oral fluconazole for twelve weeks. During consolidation treatment for infection resolution, chemotherapy involving thalidomide, melphalan, and prednisone was initiated to address multiple myeloma.  Outcome: Following successful management comprising antifungal therapy and chemotherapy regimen tailored specifically for multiple myeloma subtype IgA lambda type, no complications were reported during nine months post-treatment episode both clinically and on imaging examinations related to neurological complications associated with either condition.  Conclusion: This clinical case illustrates a rare yet intriguing scenario where an opportunistic Cryptococcus infection coincides alongside immunodeficiency-related malignancy such as multiple myeloma. Prompt diagnosis facilitated targeted management resulting in favorable patient outcomes. Understanding the complexities of such interconnected diseases aids healthcare professionals in providing comprehensive care to patients facing similar challenges.",explain
"In the first clinical case, the patient initially presented with mild hypertension and normal renal function. However, she was lost to follow-up until 2011 when she sought medical attention for weight loss and poor health status.  At this point, the patient was prescribed diltiazem and prednisone. Four months later, she was referred to the nephrology department due to high blood pressure and oliguria (low urine output). On admission, her blood pressure was very elevated at 230/140 mm Hg, and a urinalysis showed proteinuria (presence of excess protein in the urine) and hematuria (presence of blood in the urine). Further investigations revealed a significant amount of proteinuria (3.5 g in 24 hours), anemia with low hemoglobin levels (7 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), signs indicative of congestive heart failure on cardiovascular examination, hypertensive retinopathy on retinal examination, impaired renal function with elevated creatinine and blood urea levels, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase levels.  The renal sonography showed normal-sized kidneys but poor corticomedullary differentiation—a finding that can indicate underlying kidney pathology. Due to severe hypertension and complications like thrombocytopenia correction became necessary; thus Nicardipine IV perfusion treatment along with hemodialysis were started promptly. The patient also received a blood transfusion due to anemia.  The initial treatment plan included captopril three times daily for controlling hypertension after discontinuation/tapering of prednisone. To further investigate the underlying cause of these symptoms, a renal needle biopsy was performed. The histopathologic examination revealed partial cortical hemorrhagic necrosis which extended to glomerular basement membrane along with mesangial thickening characterized by edema.  Moving on to the second clinical case, a 32-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was admitted for dyspnea, low level of consciousness, oliguria, and focal neurological signs. She had recently given birth vaginally. The patient also reported diffuse joint pain (arthralgia), Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to extremities in response to cold or stress), and thickening of the skin on fingers since about a year ago.  On physical examination, her blood pressure was highly elevated at 250/130 mm Hg. She presented with beaklike facies and sausage-shaped fingers and toes—signs suggestive of acromegaly (enlargement of facial features and extremities). Hypopigmentation in a salt-and-pepper pattern was observed on the abdomen and back.  Laboratory tests revealed severe renal insufficiency with high creatinine levels, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia along with positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-scleroderma-70 antibodies. Ultrasonography showed poor corticomedullary differentiation—a feature shared with the first case—alongside echogenic renal cortices without dilation of the pelvicalyceal system.  Chest x-ray displayed an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) as well as reticulonodular lesions predominantly in the lower segments of the right lung. Echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension—a condition where there is abnormally high blood pressure within arteries that supply blood to lungs—and left ventricular dysfunction.  The patient received captopril treatment and started hemodialysis simultaneously. While her blood pressure improved following treatment initiation, her renal function did not recover well. Renal biopsy confirmed thrombotic microangiopathy—an abnormality affecting small blood vessels—which could have been responsible for affecting kidney function.  Due to financial constraints preventing immunosuppressive therapy, the patient underwent dialysis for three months. Unfortunately, she developed ischemic necrosis in her right second toe during this period. Eventually, the patient's renal function partially recovered, leading to discontinuation of dialysis.  In both cases, kidney involvement was observed with significant hypertension and renal insufficiency. The histopathologic findings in the renal biopsies suggested different underlying causes: hemorrhagic necrosis and mesangial thickening in case one, and thrombotic microangiopathy in case two. These cases highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of kidney-related conditions to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes. ",explain
"In these two clinical cases, both patients presented with symptoms that led to the suspicion of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement.  In the first case, a 48-year-old woman had a history of Lofgren's syndrome and was presenting with symptoms such as palpitations and exertional dyspnea. Upon examination, she was hemodynamically stable, with no signs of peripheral cyanosis or jugular distension. Cardiac auscultation revealed rhythmic sounds without murmurs or friction rubs. No peripheral edema or deep vein thrombosis were observed. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal.  Further investigations revealed lymphopenia and an elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed regression of mediastinal lymphadenopathies without pleuroparenchymal lesion, suggesting the possibility of sarcoidosis with heart involvement.  To confirm this diagnosis, more specialized cardiac evaluation was performed. A 24-hour holter monitoring showed recurrent episodes of ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of fibrogranulomatous tissue consistent with sarcoidosis in the left ventricular regions. Technetium99m-sestamibi scintigraphy myocardial perfusion study also indicated reduced uptake in ventricular myocardium.  Coronary angiography and left ventriculography confirmed normal coronary arteries but did not explain the observed cardiac abnormalities seen on imaging studies. Given these findings along with a history suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was made.  The patient received corticosteroids at an initial dose and gradually tapered over five months alongside supportive care. The progression throughout treatment has been favorable so far.  In Case 2, another 48-year-old woman presented to medical consultation complaining about intermittent palpitations and exertional dyspnea worsening over the past two weeks. She had a previous diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis, which was being treated with corticosteroids and antimalarial drugs.  On examination, she had a high pulse rate of 160 beats per minute but no signs of cardiac failure. Admission ECG revealed ventricular tachycardia at 160 cycles per minute. Further diagnostics including echocardiography, coronary angiography, and a cardiac electrophysiology study were performed.  The echocardiogram showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (FE), infiltration in the ventricular myocardium, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography displayed normal coronary arteries. Laboratory tests did not indicate any relevant alterations apart from the symptoms related to sarcoidosis.  Given the absence of primary heart disease to explain the observed cardiac abnormalities and considering her history of systemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement was made.  Treatment for this patient involved corticosteroids alongside supportive care. As recurrent ventricular tachycardia occurred despite amiodarone treatment, an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted to manage further arrhythmias.  In both cases presented above, sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement was suspected based on clinical symptoms along with specific laboratory findings and imaging studies that supported this diagnosis. Treatment included corticosteroids as the mainstay therapy along with additional interventions such as anti-arrhythmic drugs or ICD placement depending on individual patient needs.  It is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize these clinical features suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis in patients who have already been diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis or show classic signs and symptoms compatible with this condition. Early detection and appropriate management can help improve outcomes for these patients and prevent further complications related to heart involvement in sarcoid disease. ",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient presenting with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and vaginal bleeding, but no fever or vomiting. On examination, the patient had tenderness in the left iliac fossa and a globular uterus consistent with an eight-week pregnancy. They also had a tender, smooth, and mobile mass in the left adnexal region.  With these findings, the suspected diagnosis was a non-ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy). Further investigations were performed to confirm this suspicion. The beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level was found to be elevated at 96 702 mIU/ml. Ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous left ovarian mass measuring 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus, and no peritoneal effusion - providing further evidence for an ectopic pregnancy involving the ovary.  To definitively treat this condition, an emergency laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen) was performed under general anesthesia. During surgery, the left ovary was found to contain a gestational sac and corpus luteum (a structure that forms after egg release from the ovary). The right adnexae (structures near or attached to either side of the uterus) were normal as well as other examination findings.  The gestational sac within the ovarian capsule was removed by dissection and hemostasis procedures were carried out to control bleeding. A sample of this tissue was analyzed by a pathologist who confirmed decidual cells (cells lining the womb during pregnancy) and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule - confirming that it was indeed an ovarian ectopic pregnancy.  Following surgery, there were no complications during recovery and post-operative care for six days until discharge. Subsequent follow-up investigations showed a decrease in β hCG levels until they eventually disappeared 25 days after surgery.  An ectopic pregnancy occurs when implantation of fertilized eggs takes place outside of the uterus. While the majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes (tubal ectopic pregnancy), occasionally, they can implant within other structures such as the ovaries, cervix, or abdomen (oophorionic, cervical, or abdominal ectopic pregnancies).  In this case, it was specifically an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian ectopic pregnancies are extremely rare and account for only about 1-3% of all ectopic pregnancies. In such cases, fertilization occurs within the ovary itself rather than in the fallopian tube.  Symptoms and signs of ovarian ectopic pregnancy are often similar to tubal ectopic pregnancies and can include abdominal pain or tenderness on one side (similar to appendicitis), vaginal bleeding or spotting, and symptoms associated with early pregnancy like breast tenderness and nausea.  Prompt diagnosis is crucial because if left untreated, ovarian ectopic pregnancies can lead to serious complications such as rupture with life-threatening internal bleeding.  In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates an unusual presentation of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Through a combination of clinical findings including physical examination and ultrasound imaging along with subsequent surgical intervention followed by confirmation from pathological analysis - management was successful leading to resolution without any complications. The management of ovarian ectopic pregnancy involves prompt diagnosis and timely intervention to prevent complications. In this case, the patient presented with typical symptoms and physical examination findings consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. The elevated β hCG levels further supported this suspicion.  Ultrasonography played a critical role in confirming the presence of an ovarian mass and ruling out other possible causes. The absence of peritoneal effusion also helped differentiate it from other types of ectopic pregnancies or abdominal pathologies.  Once the diagnosis was confirmed, emergency laparotomy was performed to remove the gestational sac from the ovary while ensuring adequate hemostasis. This surgical approach is considered necessary to prevent rupture and subsequent life-threatening internal bleeding that can result from an ovarian ectopic pregnancy.  The postoperative course for this patient was uneventful, which is encouraging as it suggests that there were no complications during or after surgery. After discharge, regular follow-up care should be provided to monitor the patient's recovery and ensure complete resolution of β hCG levels.  It's important to note that although rare, ovarian ectopic pregnancies can pose diagnostic challenges due to their similarities in presentation with other gynecological conditions such as tubal ectopic pregnancies, ruptured ovarian cysts, or even pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, meticulous history-taking along with thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate investigations can help differentiate among these possibilities.  Furthermore, early identification of risk factors for ectopic pregnancies can aid in prompt diagnosis. In this case, notable risk factors include a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), lack of contraception use resulting in increased chances of conception outside the uterus, and previous vaginal delivery without any complications.  Science has advanced our understanding of these clinical scenarios; however, preventing an unplanned pregnancy through effective contraception remains crucial for reducing occurrences of both intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies. Educating patients about contraception options tailored specifically to their medical histories is a vital aspect when it comes to reproductive health.  In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the rare occurrence of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. The meticulous evaluation, correct diagnosis, and timely surgical intervention performed in this case exemplify the importance of effective communication among healthcare professionals involved in delivering optimal care to patients. By sharing such cases and disseminating knowledge about differential diagnoses and management strategies, healthcare providers can enhance their ability to identify and appropriately manage similar instances in the future.",explain
"This clinical case involves a pregnant woman who presented with multiple medical conditions and complications. On admission, she had an elevated pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. She also had a right-sided facial nerve palsy, but no other neurological deficits were noted. Her skin appeared normal without any signs of bleeding or bruising. There was no edema or jaundice observed.   A physical examination revealed that she had a 30-week gravid uterus with a dilated cervix and 40% effacement. The fetal heartbeats were not detected, indicating intrauterine fetal death. In addition, the patient had proteinuria and hyperglycemia suggestive of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes respectively.  Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with placenta abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterus), preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy), Bell's palsy (facial nerve paralysis), and gestational diabetes.  To manage her conditions, the patient was prescribed medications such as methyldopa (to lower blood pressure), nifedipine (to relax blood vessels), hydralazine (to reduce blood pressure in emergencies), magnesium sulfate (to prevent seizures associated with preeclampsia) as well as insulin to manage her high blood sugar levels.  During her hospital stay, four hours after admission she delivered a stillborn fetus weighing 1200gm without any congenital abnormalities through vaginal delivery. However, she experienced postpartum hemorrhage which required treatment such as uterine massage and oxytocin administration to stop bleeding.  Investigations done on admission showed that the patient had low red blood cell count (anemia) but normal kidney function and liver enzymes levels.  One day after delivery, the patient developed fever along with palpitations, blurred vision, dizziness, headache, and shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed severe paleness of the conjunctiva, mild swelling in her feet, increased respiratory rate, and a clear chest on auscultation. Her hemoglobin and platelet count dropped significantly.  Considering these symptoms, laboratory findings, and the recent stillbirth, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) was diagnosed. Consumptive coagulopathy was also considered due to fever and worsening hemolysis after the stillbirth.  The patient received transfusions of whole blood and platelets along with antibiotics for suspected sepsis. However, her renal function continued to deteriorate with increased swelling in her face and legs. Liver enzymes were found to be elevated as well.  Based on ongoing hemolysis (falling hemoglobin levels), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), peripheral blood smear findings of fragmented red blood cells called schistocytes and normal coagulation profile; a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) was made.  Treatment for TTP-HUS involves supportive measures such as dexamethasone administration and hemodialysis. Platelet transfusions were stopped because they can exacerbate the condition in TTP-HUS patients. Fresh frozen plasma was given instead to replenish clotting factors that may have been depleted.  After several weeks of hospitalization and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient's clinical condition improved gradually with normalization of hematological parameters such as hemoglobin levels and platelet counts. Her kidney function also improved during this time period. She was eventually discharged home in good health without any subsequent complications.  In summary, this clinical case highlights the complex nature of medical conditions that can occur during pregnancy. The patient experienced multiple complications including placenta abruption leading to intrauterine fetal death, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, Bell's palsy, postpartum hemorrhage, HELLP syndrome, and ultimately TTP-HUS. Early recognition and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial in ensuring the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the fetus.",explain
"This clinical case is quite complex, involving multiple fractures and various medical conditions. Let's break it down step by step.  The patient in question experienced several fractures throughout his body. Initially, he had surgery for fractures in his left femur (thigh bone) and right humerus (upper arm bone). While rehabilitating using a walking frame after this surgery, he sustained a fracture of his left humerus. Subsequently, he sustained a combination of right femoral (thigh bone) and tibia (shinbone) fractures while weight-bearing on his right lower limb to board a vehicle.  It was then discovered that the patient had hyperparathyroidism, which could have contributed to these subsequent fractures. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism was considered due to the patient's history of weakness, generalized bone and joint pains preceding the first fracture by about one year.  Additionally, the patient presented other symptoms such as cloudy urine and epigastric pain. These symptoms were previously informally diagnosed as gastritis caused by chronic ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Prior to these recent fractures, the patient had already undergone open reduction and internal fixation for the initial two fractures under general anesthesia. Unfortunately, during intubation for one of these procedures, the patient sustained a mandibular fracture.  Furthermore, it is important to note that the patient had received multiple blood transfusions on separate occasions prior to this current presentation.  Several findings were observed during physical examination: The patient appeared wasted with reduced muscle bulk overall. There were frontal bursing and multiple bony swellings on their lower jaw without an obvious neck mass present. Additionally, there were healed scars on their right arm and left thigh with decreased range of movement at both shoulder joints and hip joints.  Upon examination of their lower limb where they sustained recent injuries while boarding a vehicle onto their leading limb (right side), swelling was noted at both upper/middle and midshaft regions of the thigh. These areas were tender to touch. No external bleeding, bruises, or abrasions were observed.  Laboratory investigations revealed significantly elevated serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels. Specifically, their serum calcium concentration was 3.17mmol/l (normal range: 2.15-2.55 mmol/l) and alkaline phosphatase level was 260 I.U/l (normal: 40-129 I.U/l). However, all other electrolytes and the complete blood count were within normal limits.  Scouting X-rays showed evidence of both healed and healing fractures in addition to the clinically evident long bone fractures. Urinalysis revealed a presence of hematuria (blood in urine), graded as 2+.  Further imaging studies were conducted to better understand the patient's condition: Neck ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged left lower parathyroid gland, which was likely contributing to hyperparathyroidism symptoms; abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple kidney stones, potentially related to the increased serum calcium levels observed.  Parathyroid hormone levels in his blood were also measured with results showing a markedly elevated level of 202.8 pmol/l (normal range: 1.6-6.9 pmol/l). To pinpoint the exact source of abnormal parathyroid hormone secretion, a nuclear medicine study known as ^99mTc Sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy was performed revealing increased focal uptake.  Following these investigations and confirming primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma located in the left inferior parathyroid gland, surgical excision was performed under cervical block anesthesia with minimal sedation using local anesthesia at that region alone.  The surgically removed mass measured approximately 7 by 4 cm and weighed approximately 32 g; histological examination confirmed it as a parathyroid adenoma consistent with findings from imaging studies.  However, postoperatively, the patient experienced a sudden and persistent drop in serum calcium levels, necessitating continuous infusion of calcium gluconate to restore and maintain normal serum calcium concentrations.  After 15 months since the operation, the patient is now an outpatient undergoing rehabilitation. They are pain-free, more mobile in terms of physical activity, and their serum calcium levels have remained within the normal range.  In conclusion, this clinical case involved a young man who presented with multiple fractures and various symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause was identified as a parathyroid adenoma located within his left inferior parathyroid gland. Following surgical removal of the adenoma, he experienced temporary hypocalcemia but has subsequently recovered well with normal serum calcium levels.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and laboratory findings that led to the diagnosis of combined primary adrenal and spinal tuberculosis (TB) with adrenal insufficiency. The patient was started on anti-TB drugs and steroid therapy, which resulted in improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory values.  Upon examination, there were no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy or enlarged thyroid gland. The abdomen was soft and flat without organomegaly. Chest and cardiac examinations revealed no abnormalities. However, laboratory findings were notable for a red blood cell count of 4.51 × 10^12 /L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl, white blood cell count 16.31 × 10^9 / L (with differential indicating neutrophils at 61.6%, lymphocytes at 13.1%, monocytes at 7%, eosinophils at 0.1%, and basophils at 0.7%), platelet count of 308 ×10^9 /L, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm/h), high C-reactive protein (14.88 mg/L), low serum sodium (129 mmol/L), high serum potassium (5.4 mmol/L), low serum chloride (92 mmol/L), blood glucose level of118 mg/dl, normal kidney function, normal liver function, low-serum cortisol levels at both morning and afternoon measurements (2.9 µg/dL in the morning;2 .6 µg/dL in the afternoon).  Additional investigations included testing for TB-specific antibodies [IgM antibody negative; IgG antibody positive], purified protein derivative test positive). Imaging studies revealed narrowing of the L1-L2 space with irregularity and osteolysis of the endplates suggestive of spinal TB as seen on thoracic lumbar plain film.  In addition, an abdominal CT showed bilateral adrenal mass-like enlargement with irregular enhancement and lesion-like changes without calcification. These findings strongly supported a diagnosis of combined primary adrenal and spinal TB with adrenal insufficiency.  The patient was started on a combination of anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) along with vitamin B6 tablets. Steroid therapy in the form of prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) was initiated to manage adrenal insufficiency. Regular clinical follow-up every 6 months was scheduled, with all necessary investigations done each time.  In the most recent follow-up in 2012, the patient remained asymptomatic, and laboratory investigations showed near-normalization of values. The anti-TB drugs were discontinued; however, steroid therapy with prednisolone continued at the same dose as before.  While the thoracic lumbar plain film taken later in 2012 revealed similar findings to those seen during initial presentation, it is important to note that this may not indicate active disease but rather residual effects from prior infection. A CT scan of the adrenal glands confirmed reduction in size and enhancement of bilateral masses compared to previous scans; however, complete restoration of normal adrenal function could not be determined conclusively.  This case highlights an uncommon presentation of TB involving both the spine and adrenals leading to adrenal insufficiency. The prompt initiation of appropriate treatment resulted in clinical improvement and near normalization of laboratory results over time.  It also underscores the importance of comprehensive follow-up for monitoring treatment response and ensuring proper management since certain radiological abnormalities may persist despite successful treatment completion. Continuation of steroid therapy is recommended when there is evidence or suspicion for irreversible damage or functional impairment even after effective anti-TB treatment.  Overall, this case emphasizes how effective multidrug TB therapy combined with supportive measures can lead to positive outcomes despite complex presentations involving multiple organ systems affected by TB infection like spinal TB along with vascular supply interruption of the adrenal gland.",explain
"This clinical case presents a patient with a gradually worsening pain in the right lower limb, along with bluish discoloration of the skin. The patient denies any history of trauma, fever, weight loss, or bleeding from other areas of the body. There is no history of anticoagulation therapy or bleeding disorders. It is noted that this is the second episode, with a similar one occurring four years prior and resolved gradually. The patient has a significant history of alcohol consumption and was previously diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease.  Upon examination, the patient has normal blood pressure but an elevated heart rate. The right thigh shows pitting edema extending from the foot to gluteus and there is a significant difference in circumference compared to the left limb. Ecchymosis (bruising) is present on the posterior thigh. The thigh is tender to touch and movement is limited.  The abdomen appears distended with ascites (accumulation of fluid). No splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) or peripheral stigmata (visible signs) of chronic liver disease are observed. Laboratory investigations reveal severe macrocytic normochromic anemia (low red blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hypoalbuminemia (low albumin level), elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as an elevated INR indicating impaired blood clotting function.  Further tests show increased total bilirubin levels suggesting liver dysfunction, while viral screens for hepatitis B and C are negative. Doppler ultrasound reveals extensive tissue edema with a possible hematoma in the right gastrocnemius muscle without any venous clots being noted.  The CT angiogram shows no abnormalities in major arterial vessels supplying blood to the lower limb.  Considering all these findings together, this clinical case suggests a few possibilities. The symptoms and signs of acute limb ischemia (lack of blood flow to the limb) are present: worsening pain, discoloration, swelling, and decreased range of motion. Additionally, this patient has underlying liver disease with associated coagulopathy (impaired blood clotting) indicated by the elevated INR and prolonged PT.  Taking into account the patient's alcohol consumption history and alcoholic liver disease diagnosis, this case is most consistent with an acute hematoma in the right gastrocnemius muscle due to bleeding. Chronic liver disease can contribute to impaired synthesis of clotting factors leading to coagulopathy. Alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression can also contribute to anemia and thrombocytopenia seen in this case.  The management approach involved treating the underlying issues: transfusions of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were administered to correct anemia and provide clotting factors. Tranexamic acid was given as a medication that helps prevent breakdown of clots, while vitamin K was used to normalize clotting function by increasing production of clotting factors.  Pain relief medications were provided along with thiamine supplementation due to alcoholism being associated with thiamine deficiency.  Overall, this case highlights the importance of considering both localizing symptoms related to a specific body part (such as lower limb pain) as well as systemic manifestations (such as liver dysfunction) when evaluating patients. Effective communication about prognosis and lifestyle modifications is crucial for long-term management in cases like these where alcohol cessation is necessary for optimal outcomes. ",explain
"Clinical Case 1: The clinical case involves a patient who presented with persistent fever even after receiving treatment for malaria. The initial treatment included parenteral antimalarial medication (artesunate) along with oral relay therapy (artemisinin combination therapy) for three days. Additionally, the patient was given an antipyretic to lower the body temperature. However, after 48 hours, the fever persisted and blood cultures were done to identify any potential septicemia. Ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in treating bacterial infections, was prescribed for 72 hours but failed to resolve the fever. Second-line antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin was then given for another 72 hours, yet the fever persisted.  After six days of continuous monitoring and unsuccessful attempts at identifying an infectious site, other potential causes of persistent fever were investigated in children including inflammatory diseases and hematological malignancies. Biologic workups showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase - GOT and glutamic pyruvic transaminase - GPT), ferritin levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and triglycerides.  Further testing including rheumatoid factor screening, antinuclear factor assessment, anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody testing, blood smear analysis for malignant cells or parasites, as well as viral serology showed no significant abnormalities. Based on this comprehensive evaluation of clinical presentation and laboratory findings a diagnosis of Still's disease – also known as systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis – was made.  Treatment involved administering corticosteroids over a month in progressively decreasing doses combined with methotrexate starting from the second week. Twelve hours after initiating corticosteroid therapy there was complete regression of fevers along with considerable improvement in the patient's overall clinical state.  Clinical Case 2: This clinical case involves a 10-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital due to persistent fever and asthenia (weakness) that had lasted for ten days. The patient reported experiencing odynophagia (painful swallowing) two days before the onset of fever. The physical examination revealed an altered general state with a high temperature but no signs of meningeal irritation or clinically evident portal of entry for infection. However, there was class II splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), along with small swollen lymph nodes located in the inguinal region and upper right cervical chain.  The patient had previously received appropriate outpatient treatment for malaria as well as empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ceftriaxone at the correct dosage. Despite these treatments, he continued to have a persistent fever. Laboratory investigations showed severe inflammation with elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as sedimentation rate, CRP, leukocytosis along with neutrophil polynucleosis, elevated ferritin levels and increased triglycerides.  Three sets of blood cultures were sterile, indicating no bacterial infection was present. The fluid obtained from arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) revealed inflammation without any infectious agents being identified. Viral serologies including those for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV were negative. Further tests such as liver and kidney function assessment came back normal while calcium phosphate levels remained within normal range; however, LDH levels were slightly elevated.  Imaging studies including chest X-ray showed no signs of lung infection or consolidation while an ultrasound examination revealed intra-articular effusion in the right hip joint but did not find any underlying cause for concern in other body regions like lymphadenopathy in abdominal ultrasound examination.  Based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammation but non-specific evidence from imaging studies or culture results, a diagnosis of Still's disease was made.  The patient was promptly started on corticosteroid therapy at a dose of 1mg/kg and within 24 hours there was resolution of the fever. In addition to corticosteroids, bed rest was recommended during relapses along with a diet low in salt, sugar, and fat. Methotrexate at a low dose (10 mg/m2 of body surface area) was gradually introduced. With this treatment regimen, the patient showed favorable progress.  In conclusion, both clinical cases highlight the challenges faced in diagnosing patients with persistent fever without obvious infectious etiology. Through comprehensive evaluation including biological workups and screening for other potential underlying causes such as inflammatory diseases or hematological malignancies, an accurate diagnosis can be made leading to appropriate treatment interventions.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a variety of symptoms and findings, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated infection and multiple complications. The patient had a history of hypertension and took daily medications for this condition. He also had a history of working on cruise ships as a welder.  Initially, the patient was found to be dyspneic (having difficulty breathing), desaturating (decreased oxygen levels) on room air, febrile (having a fever), and tachycardic (elevated heart rate). On examination, he showed signs of jaundice with pale skin, bilateral lower limb edema (swelling), and an erythematous patch on his right leg that was warm and tender to touch. Fine crepitations were heard in his lungs upon auscultation. Abdominal examination revealed distension with tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  Initial blood work showed several abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia indicating infection, anemia with low hemoglobin levels suggesting possible bleeding or destruction of red blood cells, elevated CRP indicating inflammation, increased PCT indicating severe bacterial infection or sepsis, elevated D-dimer suggesting evidence of clot formation or thrombosis. The patient also had elevated direct bilirubin levels suggesting liver dysfunction.  Radiological investigations revealed parenchymal infiltrates suggestive of infections in his lungs along with metastatic abscesses in various locations including the liver, lower limb muscle and skin tissues as well as bone marrow involvement suggestive of osteomyelitis. CT scan showed non-enhancing cystic liver lesions while Doppler ultrasound indicated both superficial and deep vein thromboses.  Further investigations ruled out HIV infection as well as other commonly tested infections such as amoebiasis. Chest CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism but did not find any abnormality in brain imaging except mild cortical atrophy.  Due to the severity of his condition, the patient was admitted to intensive care and placed on high-flow oxygen. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics initially with Imipenem and Cilastatin along with Metronidazole. Antifungal therapy was also started empirically but discontinued due to an allergic reaction.  During his hospital stay, the patient reported loss of vision in his left eye, which upon examination was found to be suggestive of endogenous endophthalmitis (inflammation within the eye). His vision loss may have been due to the disseminated infection reaching his eyes.  Additionally, he experienced worsening breathlessness which was attributed to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on elevated cardiac markers. However, coronary angiography showed normal arteries and only 2D echocardiography revealed septal hypertrophy without any regional wall motion abnormalities.  Blood cultures eventually grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacteria commonly associated with severe infections and antibiotic resistance. The strain isolated from this patient responded well to Ceftriaxone treatment.  To manage the complications arising from this disseminated infection, intravitreal Vancomycin was given for endophthalmitis along with oral ciprofloxacin. Gradually, the patient improved as evidenced by resolution of fever and difficulty breathing along with significant improvement in infectious markers.  After 25 days in the hospital, he was discharged home with a recommendation for continued intravenous ceftriaxone treatment for another four weeks or until radiological resolution of abscesses is determined.  In summary, this clinical case highlights a complex presentation involving multiple organs affected by disseminated infection likely caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient experienced various complications including lung infiltrates, liver abscesses, deep vein thrombosis as well as involvement of skin tissues and bone marrow. Prompt identification and appropriate management played crucial roles in his eventual improvement.",explain
"In this clinical case, a patient presented with a gunshot wound to the left knee that resulted in an exit wound on the medial aspect of the knee. The external genitalia appeared normal upon inspection, and there was no urethral meatus bleeding. However, there was a laceration in the left leg.  Initial blood tests showed normal results for complete blood cell count, electrolyte profile, liver function, and coagulation. The only abnormal finding was an elevation in white blood cell count (14,000mg/dl), indicating some form of infection or inflammation.  A focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma (FAST) did not reveal any free fluid in the abdominal cavity. A plain film of the left leg revealed a small fracture in the talus bone.  After resuscitation measures were taken, the patient underwent urgent scrotal exploration due to concerns about possible testicular damage from the gunshot wound. The patient was informed that an orchiectomy (removal of one or both testicles) might be necessary if repair was not feasible.  During scrotal exploration, approximately 200ml of hematoma (blood clot) was drained and removed. Both testes were exposed and found to be completely damaged along with some fragments from the gunshot identified and removed. The scrotum was thoroughly irrigated with 3000ml of normal saline solution.  Debridement (removal of necrotic tissue) of the ruptured testis tissue was performed; however, primary closure could not be achieved due to extruded seminiferous tubules and significant tissue defects in tunica albuginea (the tough fibrous layer surrounding each testicle).  A graft procedure using tunica vaginalis as graft tissue was conducted by using Vicryl suture bilaterally to create neocapsulae around the remaining viable testicular parenchymal tissue. Vas deferens-epididymis damage was observed, and it was recommended for a delayed repair with a microsurgical procedure.  A Foley catheter (thin tube placed into the bladder to drain urine) Fr 16 was inserted. The laceration on the left leg was irrigated with 2000ml of normal saline and repaired by an orthoptist (a specialist in orthopedic procedures).  Ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, was administered at a dosage of 2 grams daily during the patient's hospital stay. Joint care between urology and orthopedics teams ensured comprehensive management of the patient's injuries.  Three days after the operation, both the drain and catheter were removed. The patient was discharged one week later with plans for outpatient follow-up care. A three-week course of cephalexin (an antibiotic) and ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) were prescribed for post-operative management.  Unfortunately, there were complications during the post-operative period, specifically fever and discharge from the surgical site. Additionally, it was determined that the left testis was not viable during follow-up at one week post-surgery necessitating orchiectomy (removal).  A four-month follow-up Doppler ultrasonography indicated that the right testis remained viable but had minimal atrophic changes. The patient reported normal erections post-surgery. Hormonal analysis revealed borderline normal serum hormone concentrations: serum testosterone level - 6.27ng/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) - 120.3nl/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) - 63.69nl/ml; prolactin level -11.05ng/ml.  Semen analysis showed a total sperm count of 12 million with a volume of 2.5cc; however, motility assessment revealed nonviable sperm cells despite having a relatively high percentage of normal forms (~70%). The patient expressed satisfaction with the cosmetic results of the procedure.  It should be noted that ethical considerations were taken into account, and the patient provided written informed consent for participation in the study discussed.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a relapsing skin condition characterized by dark erythematous lesions accompanied by erosions, crusts, blisters, pigmentation, and scale at friction sites. The lesions were predominantly seen in the axillae and groin areas. The patient experienced symptoms such as pain, itching, malodor, and fever.  The initial assessment ruled out various conditions including diabetes mellitus, endocrinological disorders, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases like tuberculosis and syphilis, as well as retroviral infection. However, the patient did have a positive family history of similar clinical presentation in his late mother.  Based on the positive family history and characteristic skin lesions in flexure areas along with a relapsing course of the illness, the initial diagnosis was Hailey-Hailey disease. Hailey-Hailey disease is an inherited condition characterized by blisters and erosions mainly affecting flexural areas of the body. However, it is important to note that this patient did not display one of the classical nail plate findings typically associated with Hailey-Hailey disease.  Due to financial constraints limiting further confirmatory testing like biopsy or genetic mutation analysis through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), definitive confirmation of diagnosis was not possible. Therefore treatment was initiated based on clinical suspicion.  The treatment plan included both topical (applied to the skin) and systemic agents (taken orally). Topical cefoperazone tazobactam was administered to address infection-related concerns given the presence of fevers. Symptomatic relief measures were also implemented using injectable glycyrrhizin acid for pain management along with analgesic-codeine phosphate for pain control and anti-histamine cetirizine for itch relief.  As there was limited improvement seen after three days on this regimen combined with laboratory results indicating active disease status (elevated inflammatory markers), an immunomodulator called azathioprine was added to the treatment plan on day 3. Azathioprine is commonly used in the management of various autoimmune conditions due to its ability to modulate immune responses.  Supportive measures were also implemented such as providing a high-quality protein diet and encouraging fluid ingestion in order to address hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin) and elevated uric levels. The patient's condition showed significant improvement after five days on azathioprine, allowing for outpatient management with continued administration of the same medication.  Although most supportive investigations, including laboratory biochemistry tests, complete blood count, serum viral screen, and autoimmune screen came back unremarkable, there were several notable findings. These included increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation), a positive skin exudation culture for Streptococcus agalactis (indicating bacterial infection), monocytosis (an increase in monocyte cells), hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypoalbuminemia(hypoglobuminemia(low globulin) These findings contributed to shaping the treatment plan.  In conclusion,this case describes a patient who presented with relapsing skin lesions that were consistent with Hailey-Hailey disease based on clinical assessment. Due to financial constraints, confirmatory testing could not be performed. The patient showed significant improvement with a combination therapy regimen involving topical and systemic agents along with supportive measures. This demonstrates the importance of considering familial history and clinical features when making diagnoses and tailoring treatment plans even when definitive testing cannot be done due to financial limitations.

"In this clinical case, the patient underwent a crown lengthening procedure in order to expose enough tooth structure for the placement of a dental crown. The lingual aspect had adequate keratinized tissue present, which means that there was enough gum tissue surrounding the tooth to ensure a healthy and stable outcome.  The crown lengthening procedure did not require any reduction of the underlying bone. This means that only soft tissue (gum) was removed in order to expose more of the tooth structure.  After two weeks, the canals of the tooth were prepared using instruments called Peso-reamers. These instruments are used to shape and clean out the root canals in preparation for further treatment. The specific sizes used were no. 2 and no. 3 reamers.  A direct pattern was made using GC Pattern Resin and a prefabricated post made by MANI Post. The pattern resin is a material that is used to create an exact replica of what will be placed inside the tooth after preparation.  The prefabricated post was placed in the mesio-buccal canal (toward front and cheek side) while still embedded in the pattern resin. After allowing it to set, or harden completely, it was then carefully removed from both resin post and core.  In parallel, another resin pattern corresponding to distal canal (toward back) placement of post was prepared simultaneously using similar technique as before with prefabricated post still embedded which later got casted using semi-precious alloy after setting completely.  Both prefabricated posts were subject to sandblasting with 50 microns aluminum oxide particles at this point for better bonding between cement and metal surface.  To facilitate easy removal of occlusal excess without using rotary tools which could potentially loosen bond between cementsetand cast-core due vibrations caused by rotary instrumentations on pre-fabricated posts now fixed into teeth openings as well as resin patterns into corresponding entry points on tooth.  To ensure a dry and isolated environment, a rubber dam was placed around the tooth during the procedure. The tooth surface was treated using 37% phosphoric acid, which helps in etching or roughening the enamel surface to improve bonding.  The canals were then rinsed and dried using distilled water and paper points. Resin-modified glass ionomer cement, or GIC, was chosen for placing the posts. This type of cement contains resin for better adhesion and strength.  The cement was carefully dispensed into both prepared canals using dispensing tips. The cast post, coated with additional cement, was placed into the tooth along with immediate placement of prefabricated post in mesio-buccal canal before the cement had fully set.  After allowing the initial setting time of 5 minutes for the cement to partially harden, any excess part of prefabricated posts that extended above gum level (occlusal excess) were tilted and broken off from assembly by utilizing small slot made at occlusal level during previous step.This provided an easy way to cut off excess material without disturbing bond between unset cement core below it also allowed patient to bite comfortably without any interference also diminishing stress on newly formed restoration structure prior its complete setting.In other words it helped ensure proper alignment between upper teeth when biting down & reduced chances breakage while chewing food etc.  Tooth preparation procedures took place after waiting 48 hours following post-cementation appointment.The margins chosen for this particular patient's case consisted of chamfer margins on distal,buccolingual aspects whereas Knife edge margin (sharp rounded edge) selected towards mesial aspect where such kind margins provide more longevity as studies claims.Also some studies suggest avoiding sub-gingival margin preparations on zirconia restorations since newer materials available that allow highly polished surfaces which enhances attachment between gums (""hemi-desmosomal"" attachment) resuting less chances of bacterial leakage which could in turn lead to tooth decay under restoration edges. Modern zirconia materials offers thin margin as 0.2mm thickness can be easily achieved comparing with conventional dentistry materials.   In summary, this clinical case involved a comprehensive approach to restoring a tooth after crown lengthening procedure. The use of prefabricated posts, resin pattern resin, and careful cementation techniques were employed to ensure a successful outcome. The choice of specific margins and zirconia material utilized helps prolong the longevity of the restoration while minimizing potential complications such as bacterial leakage and marginal decay.

"In this clinical case, we have a patient with a history of scleroderma and limited involvement of the left scalp and face. The patient did not have any symptoms related to systemic sclerosis, but did mention a history of malnutrition during childhood and an allergy to penicillin. In 2015, the patient started taking methotrexate for her scleroderma.  In February 2016, an MRI was done which revealed some findings. It was noted that there was no involvement of the skin elsewhere in the body. A CT angiogram was also performed, which showed no abnormalities in the blood vessels. Figure 2 presents some features that were discovered on the MRI sequences.  The patient underwent another MRI in May 2016, which showed that the lesion remained stable. At this time, she did not complain of any new symptoms during her visit to the clinic. However, on May 2017, when she had another repeat MRI, it was observed that there was a mild increase in size of the intraaxial lesion. The post-contrast MRI also revealed a small enhancing nodule along the lateral margin of the lesion.  In September 2017, when seen again at clinic follow-up appointment, she reported experiencing mild sensory changes on her right side for several years and requested removal of intraaxial lesion; although she mentioned this symptom had not changed recently. Neurological examination conducted at this time included assessments such as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), motor strength assessment (which yielded normal results), reflexes check (which were present) as well as no focal neurological abnormalities detected or noted. Considering surgical options for optimal scalp incisional planning,w ith input from plastic surgeons it was decided to stay medial with opening scalp incision plan.  The risks associated with surgery were explained to her prior to obtaining informed consent from patients tor agreeing for surgery wherein they agreed upon removal after accepting risk factors. Upon being brought into the operating theatre and with the participation of plastic surgeons, a left frontal craniotomy was performed. Neuronavigation and ultrasound were used during surgery to help locate the tumor, which was found below the scalp lesion and skull defect. A brain needle was then utilized for tapping of the cyst with hemorrhagic fluid which appeared to be chronic in nature (a sample sent cell analysis). The wall of the cyst was resected, revealing a deposit of hemosiderin. Two areas of nodularity were observed, one consistent with that seen on ultrasound and subsequently removed. It appeared to resemble a thrombosed vein or hemangioblastoma nodule primarily. All specimens obtained during surgery were sent for pathological evaluation.  Upon microscopic examination of histopathology sections obtained from resection area it demonstrated white matter containing multiple blood vessels exhibiting irregular outlines along with paper-thin walls lacking smooth muscle; additionally lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. Presence of hyalinised connective tissue replacing some obsolete blood vessels noted. Furthermore white matter displayed signs severe piloid gliosis along with numerous Rosenthal fibers seen scattered throughout. Multiple clusters containing macrophages laden with hemosiderin detected too ; CD34 staining highlighted thin walled blood vessels further, On evaluating all findings no evidence for presence neoplastic abnormalities observed . Ultimately final diagnosis established for this patient as cavernous angioma.

"In this clinical case, we are presented with four individuals who have been diagnosed with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11β-OHD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands and leads to various symptoms and complications.  Patient 1 is a 36-year-old male who was diagnosed with homozygous p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene. At the age of 25, he developed grade 3 hypertension along with hypokalemia (low potassium levels). He was prescribed Calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and Beta-blocker (atenolol) to manage his hypertension. Despite poor compliance with treatment, he did not experience acute adrenal deficiency during his follow-up. However, he had occasional episodes of abdominal pain which were relieved after correcting his hypokalemia. Later on, at the age of 36, spironolactone was added to manage persistent hypokalemia. Over time, patient 1 experienced progressive weight gain and developed metabolic syndrome characterized by android fat distribution (increased waist circumference) and low HDL levels.  Patient 2 is a 35-year-old female who was diagnosed with 11β-OHD at birth due to virilization of external genitalia. She underwent corrective surgery for her genital abnormalities but had normal blood pressure throughout her regular check-ups. However, she did experience hypokalemia and was initially treated with hydrocortisone medication without any acute adrenal deficiencies observed during her follow-up period. Patient 2 also developed metabolic syndrome along with class I obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) since the age of 28. The diagnosis of PCOS was made based on symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), alopecia (hair loss), and elevated testosterone levels.  Patient 3 is a female aged 33, diagnosed with 11β-OHD prenatally. Her mother had received treatment with dexamethasone during pregnancy to manage the condition. Patient 3 also had virilization of the external genitalia and underwent corrective surgery at birth. She had an irregular follow-up and was initially treated with hydrocortisone medication without experiencing acute adrenal deficiency. However, she developed PCOS with hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles and was treated with estrogen therapy (estradiol) along with cyproterone acetate to manage her symptoms.  Patient 4 is a male who was diagnosed with 11β-OHD at the age of 2 due to peripheral precocious puberty. Unfortunately, patient 4 did not have a genetic analysis performed and passed away at the age of 12 due to a postoperative infection following orthopedic surgery for scoliosis.  In addition to these patients, there are two remaining family members: patient 5, a sister aged 28 who is married and has two healthy children, and patient 6, another sister aged 21 who is currently undergoing treatment for depression in psychiatry.  Overall, this clinical case highlights the diverse range of symptoms and complications associated with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11β-OHD). Patients may present with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic syndrome features such as obesity and PCOS in females, as well as genital abnormalities. It emphasizes the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis in order to provide appropriate management strategies tailored to each individual's needs. Patient 1's case demonstrates the impact of the p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene. This mutation affects the enzyme responsible for converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and leads to an accumulation of steroid precursors, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and corticosterone. The excessive accumulation of these precursors contributes to hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia.  The development of grade 3 hypertension in patient 1 may be a result of increased levels of DOC, which has mineralocorticoid activity. The elevated DOC can lead to sodium retention and potassium loss, resulting in fluid overload and high blood pressure. To manage this hypertension-related complication, patient 1 was prescribed a combination therapy including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine) and beta-blockers (atenolol). These medications help lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels or reducing cardiac output.  Despite poor compliance with treatment, patient 1 did not experience acute adrenal deficiency during his follow-up period. Acute adrenal deficiency refers to a sudden drop or absence of cortisol production by the adrenal glands. It is essential for patients with adrenal insufficiency to adhere to their hydrocortisone medication regimen because inadequate cortisol levels can lead to life-threatening situations during periods of stress or illness.  Patient 2's case shares similarities with patient 1 as both have been diagnosed with homozygous forms of p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene; however, their clinical presentations differ significantly. While patient 2 displayed normal blood pressure throughout her regular check-ups, she experienced hypokalemia similar to her male sibling. Patient 2 also developed metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity (class I) along with PCOS symptoms such as spaniomenorrhea (irregular menstrual cycles), hirsutism, alopecia, and hyperandrogenism. This suggests that the p.Gly379Val mutation can result in varied clinical manifestations, likely due to additional genetic or environmental factors.  The presence of PCOS in patient 2 could be influenced by hormonal imbalances caused by increased production of adrenal androgen precursors due to the deficiency in the enzymatic activity of CYP11B1. The excess androgen production leads to symptoms associated with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, which contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome features like obesity.  Patient 3's case demonstrates a prenatal diagnosis of 11β-OHD due to maternal administration of dexamethasone during pregnancy. Maternal treatment with glucocorticoids is currently recommended for pregnant women carrying female fetuses affected by classic forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), including 11β-OHD. The early intervention aims to minimize virilization effects on external genitalia development. However, this patient still presented with genital abnormalities requiring corrective surgery at birth.  Patient 3 has significant irregularities in her follow-up care but was treated initially with hydrocortisone medication without experiencing acute adrenal deficiency. In addition to the symptoms related to hormonal imbalances seen in patient 2 (PCOS features), she also struggles with depression for which she is seeking psychiatric treatment.  The tragic case of patient 4 highlights the impact of this condition if left untreated or not managed adequately. Patient 4 developed peripheral precocious puberty as a result of CYP11B1 enzyme deficiency generating excessive levels of sex hormones at an early age. Unfortunately, this individual did not undergo genetic analysis, potentially missing an opportunity for earlier interventions or tailored management strategies that could have positively impacted their quality and length of life.  It is crucial for remaining family members, namely patients 5 and 6, to undergo genetic analysis since they share a familial link with patients diagnosed with homozygous p.Gly379Val mutation. Genetic analysis would help identify whether they also carry this mutation and allow for appropriate management recommendations to prevent or address potential complications associated with 11β-OHD.  In summary, this clinical case highlights the variable presentations and complications of 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11β-OHD) resulting from mutations in the CYP11B1 gene. It underscores the importance of genetic analysis for accurate diagnosis and personalized care plans tailored to each individual affected by this condition. Early interventions targeting hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic syndrome features like obesity and PCOS symptoms, as well as close monitoring for adrenal insufficiency or other potential complications, can significantly improve patient outcomes and their overall quality of life.",explain
"Title: A Case of Delirium and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome  Introduction:  This clinical case describes a patient who presented with agitated and combative behavior, initially attributed to dissatisfaction with rehabilitation progress. However, through careful assessment and investigation, a provisional diagnosis of delirium due to a recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) was made. Subsequently, the patient's condition deteriorated further, eventually leading to a complex partial seizure and the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Prompt recognition and management of these conditions were crucial in achieving successful patient outcomes.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient initially exhibited signs consistent with delirium, including agitation, combativeness, refusal of medication and oral intake, as well as progressively worsening sleep disturbances. Given the absence of psychiatric history or substance abuse and no exposure to neuroleptics in the past, these symptoms were suspected to be secondary to an underlying physiological cause rather than behavioral factors alone.  Diagnosis:  A review revealed previous treatment for UTI during hospitalization which indicated a potential association between recurrent infections and the current symptoms. To confirm this suspicion, urinalysis was ordered for further investigation while immediate symptomatic management was initiated using Olanzapine 10 mg IM stat.  On presenting evidence from urinalysis that confirmed urinary tract bacterial infection on the following day after initiating intravenous antibiotics for treatment purposes,the patient continued exhibiting agitated behavior prompting administration of haloperidol 10 mg IM in order to manage his symptoms.  Clinical Deterioration:  Despite initial symptom improvement following treatment initiation,the third day demonstrated significant changes in mental state including perplexed affect,distractibility,poor initiation abilities,and immobility.Unresponsiveness,staring,and inappropriate language use were also notable.The presence of generalized spasticity throughout movement examinations prohibited thorough assessment.Pain elicited purposeful withdrawal responses but verbal commands did not register appropriately.CNS involvement became difficult discern especially due to constant movement and agitation by the patient.  Laboratory Investigation:  Concurrently, laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, serum creatinine,and liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),aspartate aminotransferase(AST),gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT),as well as significantly raised creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.An abnormally low urine output further added to the complexity of this case.  Development of Complex Partial Seizure:  Early the next morning following admission to ICU,the patient experienced a complex partial seizure which was promptly managed through intravenous diazepam administration.Additional diagnostic tests, including lumbar puncture (LP), CT scan of the head,and electroencephalogram (EEG) were conducted but did not yield any significant findings.  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Diagnosis:  Considering the overall clinical picture, including deteriorating mental state,involuntary movements and raised CPK levels, a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome was made. The patient was commenced on bromocriptine 7.5 mg three times daily alongside lorazepam 1mg at bedtime for symptom management.As NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antidopaminergic medications,a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment initiated in critical-care setting was crucial for optimal outcomes.  Recovery and Rehabilitation:  Following treatment initiation,major improvements in rigidity levels,agitation,and periods of wakefulness were observed on days five and six post-ICU admission.The patient regained full orientation and cooperation.Subsequent normalization of liver function tests and CPK levels further supported recovery.Patient subsequently transferred from ICU to general ward for continued monitoring,rehabilitation,and care.  Conclusion:  This clinical case highlights the importance of careful assessment,diligent investigation strategies,and timely interventions in managing complex patients presenting with diverse symptoms.A comprehensive diagnostic approach can help identify underlying causes and provide appropriate treatment plans to ensure optimal patient outcomes.Clinical vigilance and expertise are key in recognizing potential life-threatening conditions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and facilitating prompt management.

"This clinical case involves a patient who presented with a complex set of symptoms and medical history. Let's break it down step by step for better understanding.  The patient had a past medical history of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, which is an inflammatory condition that commonly affects small blood vessels in children. This information is important as it provides insight into the patient's overall health and potential predisposition to certain conditions.  The social history revealed that the patient was a smoker, having smoked 11 pack-years. Smoking is known to have detrimental effects on respiratory function and general health, which could be relevant later in the case.  The family history was non-contributory, meaning there were no known genetic or familial conditions that might offer insight into the current presentation. However, family history can sometimes play a role in certain diseases or conditions, so it is important to mention its absence.  Initial laboratory tests showed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count with neutrophils being predominant). Neutrophilic leukocytosis is often associated with bacterial infections or inflammation.  A CT scan revealed several findings including small bilateral pleural effusions (fluid around the lungs), small hepatic enlargement (enlarged liver), Gerota's fascia thickening (the tissue surrounding the kidneys), perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening (swelling and thickened tissue in the perineal area), and small bubbles of air. These findings raised suspicion for Fournier's gangrene, which is a life-threatening infection affecting genitalia/perineum and spreading to surrounding tissues rapidly.   Based on calculated scoring systems like FGSI (Fournier Gangrene Severity Index), UFGSI (Uludag Fournier Gangrene Severity Index), and LRINEC score( Laboratory Risk Indicator for necrotizing fasciitis) indicating severe infection; immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue was performed. During surgery, samples were taken for microbiologic analysis to identify the causative agents.  The patient's condition worsened, and she developed a fever. Microbiologic cultures revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, indicating multiple infections from different organisms. As a result, the antibiotic regimen was modified and antifungal treatment initiated.  Debridements were repeated every 24 hours due to the extensive nature of the lesions. After ten days, the patient underwent another surgical procedure for temporary ileostomy (creating an opening in the small intestine) to ease recovery.  Complications arose with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (a type of pneumonia caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and occlusion of the left internal jugular vein (a large vein in the neck). The patient received additional antibiotics targeting MRSA and underwent vascular ultrasound examination as well as transcranial Doppler examination to assess blood flow in arteries supplying brain. Dental consultation showed no abnormalities that could explain these complications.  Gradually, with ongoing debridements and treatments including anticoagulation therapy (blood thinners), her condition improved. She became afebrile (no longer had a fever), leading to her discharge from ICU after 13 days.   A follow-up CTA (computed tomography angiography) confirmed that left jugular vein thrombosis had resolved - meaning blood clotting resolved naturally on its own without complications.  About a month later, she underwent surgery for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of an area on her right buttock known as ""right gluteal region.""  Six months later during follow-up examinations, it was noted that she had returned to her normal everyday life suggesting complete recovery from this extensive infection episode.  In summary, this case highlights the complexity involved in diagnosing and managing severe infections such as Fournier's gangrene. It demonstrates the importance of microbiologic analysis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, surgical interventions like debridement, and timely recognition and management of complications like pneumonia and thrombosis. Additionally, it underscores the importance of follow-up care to monitor long-term recovery.",explain
"Clinical Case Explanation:  This clinical case involves a young child who developed seizures and nodding shortly after returning home from an Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP) camp. The child was born without any complications, and his mother reported having a healthy pregnancy with no intake of harmful substances or medications.  Upon examination, the child was found to be dehydrated, febrile (having a fever), and moderately wasted (showing signs of malnutrition). A mass was identified in the right lumbar region, which was tender, indurated (hardened), and non-fluctuant (not filled with fluid). However, there were no palpable abnormalities in the spleen or liver. The rectum had a normal amount of fecal material and there were no signs of rectal bleeding.  Haematological investigations revealed certain abnormalities in the blood picture. There were elevated levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), lymphocytes (another type of white blood cell), monocytes (a type of immune cell), and eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in allergic responses). Additionally, immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes were observed on the peripheral film report. Liver function tests showed elevated levels for ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase), indicating potential liver damage. Serum protein levels appeared low but renal function tests as well as serum electrolyte levels fell within normal ranges.  An abdominal ultrasound revealed inflammation in the internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. To address this issue, incision and drainage procedures were conducted at Gulu Hospital with subsequent open wound management for 14 days before secondary wound closure took place. The patient also received supplementary food rehabilitation to combat malnutrition while their seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate under direct observation therapy.  After these interventions, which spanned over one month, the child showed significant improvement. Seizures and nodding completely stopped, and the child was able to return to a normal daily life. A follow-up review revealed that renal function tests and serum electrolytes were within normal ranges except for ongoing high liver enzyme levels.  In summary, this clinical case depicts a child who developed seizures and nodding after returning home from an IDP camp. The initial investigation indicated malnutrition, inflammation in the abdominal muscles, and abnormalities in blood counts and liver function tests. With appropriate interventions including wound management, nutritional support, and medication adjustments, all seizure activity ceased with subsequent improvements except for persistently elevated liver enzymes.  Further investigations may be required to determine the cause of the elevated liver enzymes after these interventions. Continued monitoring of this patient's condition is essential in order to ensure effective management moving forward. In order to further understand the clinical case, additional investigations may be necessary to determine the cause of the persistently elevated liver enzymes in the child. The elevated liver function tests (ALT and AST) indicate potential liver damage or dysfunction. This could be due to several factors, including infections, metabolic disorders, toxic injury or drug reactions.  Considering that this patient was born in an IDP camp and has a history of exclusive feeding on relief food provided by WFP during pregnancy, it is important to consider any potential infectious causes that may have contributed to his current condition. Gastrointestinal infections such as viral hepatitis or parasitic infestation could affect liver function and cause abnormal enzyme levels.  Furthermore, the presence of eosinophilia in this case raises suspicion for parasitic infection as well. Eosinophils are involved in immune responses against parasites and their elevation suggests an ongoing immune reaction against a parasitic pathogen. Additional investigations focusing on identifying specific parasites, such as stool examination for ova and parasites or serological tests for specific pathogens like Schistosoma spp., should be considered.  It is also worth noting that the child has a history of seizures which responded well to Sodium Valproate therapy after interventions at Gulu Hospital. This suggests that his seizures were likely related to an underlying condition rather than being solely an independent issue. The initial investigations revealed abnormalities in blood counts with immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on peripheral film report indicating possible immune dysregulation.  Given these findings along with persistent elevation of liver enzymes even after interventions, additional immunological evaluations may be warranted. The possibility of an autoimmune disorder affecting multiple systems cannot be ruled out completely without further investigation into autoantibodies associated with organ-specific or systemic autoimmune diseases that may affect both neurological function (seizures) and liver health.  Additionally, considering this patient's history of living in IDP camps where access to healthcare might have been limited and exposure to environmental factors could have been significant, it is crucial to assess if any long-term effects of living in such conditions might be contributing to his current condition. This may involve evaluating for chronic exposure to environmental toxins or other risk factors characteristic of IDP camp settings.  Overall, the clinical case presents a complex scenario with multiple potential contributing factors. Further investigations including stool examination for parasites, autoimmune screening, and evaluation for environmental exposures are necessary to attain a complete understanding of this child's condition and provide appropriate management moving forward. Close monitoring of liver function tests should continue along with the maintenance of appropriate seizure control through medication adjustment and observation therapy. Collaborative care involving specialists from various fields including infectious diseases, gastroenterology/hepatology, immunology/rheumatology, and neurology will be essential in formulating an accurate diagnosis and optimizing treatment outcomes for this patient.",explain
"Title: Sturge-Weber Syndrome and its Manifestations: A Clinical Case Study  Introduction: This clinical case presents a young woman with a complex set of symptoms that can be attributed to Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). The patient has a history of callosotomy for seizure control at age 6 and experienced her first post-surgical seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark at age 18. To manage her seizures, she was prescribed carbamazepine, which effectively controlled seizures. However, despite normal development in infancy, the patient faced significant challenges in terms of cognitive abilities and academic performance.  Clinical Presentation: The patient's family history is largely unremarkable; however, her elder sister also had a port wine stain on her face but did not exhibit any signs of SWS. This suggests that the siblings might share the genetic basis for their birthmarks but only one developed SWS-related symptoms.  Key Diagnostic Findings: 1. Physical Examination:    - Facial nevus: The presence of angioma-caused facial nevi on the right forehead, eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek.    - Gingival overgrowth: Bright red gingival enlargement with angiomatous characteristics.    - Extremities asymmetry: Mild size discrepancy between the left arm/leg versus the right arm/leg with associated hemiparesis (muscular weakness).  2. Ophthalmological Evaluation:    - Glaucoma diagnosis in the right eye.  3. Neurological Evaluation:    - Hemiparesis: Weakness observed on both upper and lower extremities on the same side as facial nevus.    - Cranial CT Scan findings include diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.    - Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI showed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures, in addition to diffuse atrophy confined to the right hemisphere.    - Axial T1-weighted cranial MRI demonstrates right calvarial thickness compared to the left, as well as asymmetrical overall size with smaller volume on the right side.    - Extensive venous formations are observed around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and localized at Gallen vein, perivascular space anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon, and in the right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern.  4. Intellectual Capacity:    - Proteus intelligence test revealed a score of 75 points equivalent to mild mental retardation.  Discussion: The combined clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). This neurocutaneous disorder manifests as capillary malformations (port wine stains), ocular abnormalities (glaucoma), and neurological features such as seizures and developmental delays. The characteristic radiological findings observed, including diffuse brain atrophy in the affected hemisphere along with double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications suggest underlying pathology associated with SWS.  Sturge-Weber Syndrome is sporadic but can occur due to somatic mutations affecting GNAQ gene. It is important for family members of individuals affected by SWS or presenting port wine birthmarks also seek medical evaluation for any associated symptoms or complications that could arise later in life.  Management: The patient has been prescribed carbamazepine successfully for seizure control following callosotomy performed earlier in life. Close monitoring is essential since medication management may require adjustments over time. Comorbid conditions such as anxiety disorder have also been identified during psychiatric evaluation; therefore, additional medications like ketiapin and venlafaxine have been prescribed accordingly.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights various manifestations associated with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) — a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by capillary malformations, ocular abnormalities, and neurological features such as seizures and developmental delays. Early detection and proper management are crucial to optimize the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals is essential in providing comprehensive care to individuals affected by this complex condition.  Please note that this clinical case study is provided for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider regarding any individual medical concerns or conditions.",explain
"This clinical case describes a patient, Mrs. AMS, who presents with episodes of palpitations and lipothymia (a momentary loss of consciousness). Upon analysis of her medical history, it is revealed that she has a past medical history of asthma attacks but has not experienced any in over a year. She is also primipara, meaning this is her first pregnancy and she has given birth to a healthy child.  The initial examination reveals that Mrs. AMS has a normal cardiovascular examination with no heart murmur or signs of heart failure. Her blood pressure while lying down and standing up is slightly different on her right arm compared to her left arm. Additional examinations including 12-lead surface ECG and Doppler echocardiography are found to be normal.  Further investigations show that Mrs. AMS has hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), which could potentially contribute to her symptoms. She is prescribed magnesium supplementation as well as atenolol, which is a beta-blocker medication used to control heart rate and rhythm disorders.  However, after some time, Mrs. AMS experiences recurring symptoms such as chest tightness, palpitations, lipothymia, discomfort, and dizziness despite the treatment regimen. A 24-hours Holter ECG reveals ventricular extrasystoles (abnormal heartbeats originating from the ventricles) and unsustained ventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rhythm).  To address these persistent symptoms, her medication regimen is modified with the introduction of amiodarone initially and later replacing it with higher doses of atenolol. This helps alleviate her symptoms temporarily but does not result in sustained improvement.  At this point in the case presentation, it becomes evident that Mrs. AMS becomes pregnant again despite experiencing these recurrent symptoms related to cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy.  During the subsequent months of pregnancy leading up to admission into intensive care for severe symptoms, Mrs. AMS undergoes various treatments including the administration of potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, acebutolol, enoxaparin (a blood-thinning medication), and nadolol. Each treatment aims to control her arrhythmia and prevent its recurrence.  Despite the modifications in her treatment regimen and prolonged hospitalizations, Mrs. AMS continued to experience ventricular tachycardia attacks until a combination of flecainide (an antiarrhythmic drug) and nadolol provided better control over her symptoms.  Eventually, she is referred to another country for advanced electrophysiological study which confirms the type of ventricular tachycardia she is experiencing - infundibular VT. This type of VT originates from an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart's right ventricle. The condition can be successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation, which is a procedure that destroys or scarring tissue responsible for generating abnormal electrical signals.  Following radiofrequency ablation treatment and discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs, Mrs. AMS experiences successful management of her condition without any cardiac complications throughout her pregnancy leading up to vaginal delivery.  Overall, this clinical case emphasizes the complexities involved in diagnosing and treating patients with cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy. It highlights the challenges healthcare professionals encounter when managing such cases while prioritizing both maternal health and fetal well-being. Through appropriate investigations and interventions involving multiple medications as well as invasive procedures like radiofrequency ablation, successful outcomes can be achieved for both mother and child in such scenarios.

"Clinical Case 1: The first clinical case involves a patient who has presented with various symptoms and findings suggestive of advanced liver disease. The laboratory findings reveal low hemoglobin levels (Hct: 38.4%) and low platelet count (109,000 mm3), which are typical of cirrhosis. The liver function tests, specifically amylase (1523 U/L) and lipase (1254 U/L), are elevated, indicating pancreatitis. Furthermore, the presence of HbsAg suggests an active hepatitis B infection.  Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrates a cirrhotic appearance of the liver and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). Gastroscopy reveals the presence of grade III esophageal varices, which are dilated veins in the esophagus often associated with portal hypertension.  Dynamic contrasted abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts, suggesting biliary obstruction or cholestasis. There is also an intense arterial phase contrast in a mass located in the fourth segment of the left lobe of the liver measuring 10x8 cm.  MR angiography further reveals thrombus formation within the portal vein left branch. A biopsy performed on this mass confirms focal nodular hyperplasia rather than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tenofovir is prescribed to manage HBV infection.  Endoscopic ultrasonography then demonstrates a mass measuring 10 cm in diameter within the left lobe of the liver along with thrombus formation within the portal vein. A biopsy taken from both sites confirms HCC diagnosis.  The patient undergoes radiofrequency embolization for HCC treatment and remains under close medical supervision.  Clinical Case 2: In this second case, a male patient diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B had previously undergone surgical removal for a small tumor identified as HCC five years ago. However, he now presents with abdominal pain. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function test findings, such as elevated aminotransferases (AST: 92 U/L, ALT: 89 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP: 139 U/L). Additionally, high gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (386 U/L) indicate cholestasis.  Abdominal tomography reveals a solid mass in the left lobe of the liver next to the lateral segment anterior. This mass measures 80x52 mm and exhibits arterial phase enhancement but lacks wash-out characteristics typically seen in HCC. Angiography of the abdomen confirms thrombus formation within the portal vein left branch.  The patient undergoes endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy on both the liver mass and portal vein thrombus, which confirms HCC diagnosis for both specimens. Radiofrequency embolization is performed as treatment for HCC.  Clinical Case 3: The third case involves an elderly male diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B who has been receiving lamivudine treatment for four years. He presents with complaints of leg swelling, fatigue, joint pain, and mild edema.  Laboratory tests demonstrate mild abnormalities in liver function tests including elevated aminotransferases (AST: 81 U/L, ALT: 95 U/L). There are also marginal decreases in hemoglobin levels (Hct:30.2%) and platelet count slightly below normal limits (213,000 mm3).  Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging reveals a cirrhotic liver with two distinct masses; one lesion measuring 70x45 mm on the seventh segment of the right lobe and another centrally located lesion measuring 25x20 mm extending to the inferior vena cava causing tumor thrombus formation within this vessel.  Endoscopic ultrasound detects two masses on segments seven and eight of the liver along with extension of thrombus into the inferior vena cava. Biopsy of the thrombus confirms HCC diagnosis.  The patient undergoes radiofrequency embolization for HCC treatment and requires close follow-up.  In summary, all three cases involve patients with chronic hepatitis B who subsequently develop HCC. The management includes antiviral therapy, embolization procedures, and ongoing surveillance to monitor disease progression and response to treatment.",explain
"On examination, the patient appeared pale and had a low-grade fever. His vital signs were stable, with no significant abnormalities noted in blood pressure or heart rate. Auscultation of the chest revealed coarse crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs.  Given the patient's symptoms and findings on clinical examination, further investigations were ordered to determine the underlying cause. Initial blood tests showed a mild leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and anemia. A sputum sample was collected for microbiological analysis.  The patient underwent a chest X-ray, which revealed multiple cavitary lesions in both lung fields. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed to obtain a more detailed evaluation. The CT scan confirmed the presence of multiple cavities with surrounding infiltrates in both lungs.  Considering these findings along with the patient's history and radiological evidence, tuberculosis (TB) was suspected as a possible diagnosis. The patient was subsequently referred to the Department of Pulmonology for further evaluation and management.  In pulmonology department, specialized tests were conducted including acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining on sputum samples as well as mycobacterial cultures to confirm Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The AFB smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli stain came out positive after Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique while mycobacterial culture also yielded growth suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Based on these results, a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was established. The patient was promptly started on a four-drug antitubercular regimen comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for an initial two-month intensive phase followed by continuation phase therapy with isoniazid plus rifampicin for another four months. Additionally prescribed supportive medications included analgesics for chest pain, cough suppressants, and bronchodilators to alleviate breathlessness.  During the course of treatment, the patient showed significant improvement with resolution of his symptoms. His cough reduced drastically, and he no longer experienced chest pain or breathlessness. The episodes of fever also subsided completely. Furthermore, repeat sputum samples taken at regular intervals turned negative for acid-fast bacilli.  The patient completed the full six-month course of antitubercular therapy without any major adverse effects or complications. Subsequent follow-up visits showed no recurrence or relapse of tuberculosis.  This case highlights the importance of considering tuberculosis as a potential diagnosis in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms such as prolonged cough, expectoration, fever with chills and night sweats even in non-diabetic individuals who otherwise may not be considered high-risk candidates for TB infection. It also emphasizes the value of accurate diagnostic testing including AFB staining and mycobacterial cultures to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis promptly.  Early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can lead to successful management and prevention of further transmission. Patient education about adherence to therapy is crucial to ensure completion and success in treating pulmonary tuberculosis. Overall, this case demonstrates that prompt recognition and proper management can help achieve favorable outcomes in patients with tuberculosis infections , even in non-diabetic individuals. It is important to note that diabetes is one of the risk factors for developing tuberculosis, as it weakens the immune system and makes individuals more susceptible to infections. However, tuberculosis can still occur in individuals without diabetes, especially considering the high prevalence of tuberculosis in countries like India.  The patient's response to antitubercular therapy was encouraging and demonstrated the efficacy of the treatment regimen. It is crucial for patients to adhere strictly to their medication schedule and complete the full course of treatment to prevent drug resistance and potential relapse.  In addition to pharmacological management, it is essential to provide comprehensive care for patients with tuberculosis. This includes nutritional support, as malnutrition often accompanies TB infection due to reduced appetite and systemic effects on metabolism. The patient should follow a well-balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals to aid recovery.  Furthermore, respiratory hygiene measures should be emphasized during counseling sessions with patients. Properly covering their mouths while coughing or sneezing can reduce transmission rates among close contacts or family members.  As part of public health efforts aimed at reducing the burden of tuberculosis on communities, contact tracing should be initiated for every confirmed case. Close contacts should undergo screening examinations such as chest X-rays or tuberculin skin tests (TST) even if they do not exhibit any symptoms yet. This helps identify latent TB infection early on and provides an opportunity for preventative treatment if needed.  Health education programs emphasizing awareness about tuberculosis transmission routes are essential components of preventing further spread within communities. People need information about how TB spreads through droplet nuclei when an infected individual coughs or sneezes without proper respiratory hygiene practices.  In conclusion, this case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis when evaluating patients presenting with respiratory symptoms such as prolonged coughing episodes accompanied by expectoration, persistent fever with chills and night sweats even among non-diabetic individuals. Early diagnosis, accurate testing, and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment can lead to successful management, resolution of symptoms, and prevention of further transmission.  It is crucial for healthcare providers to be aware of the possibility of tuberculosis even in patients without diabetes or traditional risk factors. Vigilance and timely intervention can significantly impact patient outcomes while contributing to the global effort towards reducing the burden of tuberculosis worldwide. Thus, ongoing education and awareness campaigns aimed at both medical professionals and the general population remain integral in tackling this public health challenge.",continue
"The patient reported experiencing severe pain during her menstrual cycles, which lasted for several days and interfered with her daily activities. She also complained of lower abdominal pain that was present even outside of her menstrual cycle. The pelvic mass was tender to touch and caused further discomfort for the patient.  Given the girl's age and symptoms, investigations were undertaken to determine the cause of her primary amenorrhea and pelvic pain. A thorough medical history revealed no significant illnesses, previous surgeries, or traumatic events that could explain her condition. Blood tests were conducted to assess hormone levels, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, and progesterone. Additionally, a complete blood count (CBC) was performed to rule out any systemic abnormalities.  The hormonal profile results showed raised levels of FSH and LH compared to the normal ranges expected for a 14-year-old girl who has yet to start menstruation. This indicated a dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle. Further imaging studies were conducted using ultrasonography.  Ultrasonography revealed an enlarged uterus with thickened endometrium compared to usual size in adolescents before menarche; however, no abnormalities were identified within the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Given these findings along with the symptoms described by the patient, suggesting chronic cyclic pelvic pain associated with menstruation despite amenorrhea suggested dysmenorrhea as a possible diagnosis.  Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstruation without pathologic findings on physical examination or imaging studies; however secondary causes such as endometriosis can lead to chronic dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls but unlikely in our scenario due lack of features like dyspareunia (painful intercourse), abnormal vaginal bleeding apart from regular menses etc., On reviewing current evidence videoscopy would be considered gold standard investigations; however experiencing a menarche is critical for dysmenorrhea to occur, Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is inclusive of dysmenorrhea.  Regarding the differential diagnosis, it was important to consider any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Müllerian agenesis, also known as Mullerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), was considered given the primary amenorrhea and absent uterus. However further examination revealed normal external genitalia with well-defined labia majora, labia minora and clitoris.  Based on the presence of a normal external genital appearance and absence of Müllerian abnormalities, as well as hormone abnormalities consistent with hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian dysfunction causing primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain; diagnosis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) was made. FHA represents a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, psychological stressors such as anxiety or depression and energy imbalance due disordered eating habits leading to restrictive caloric intake in this scenario; psychosocial background plays an essential part in management targeting patient  Management options for FHA are multifaceted including reverse energy deficiency by increasing calorie intake promoting weight gain along side dietitians counselling supports good nutrition rooted from balanced carbohydrate-protein-fat balance along exercise into routine lifestyle preventing osteoporosis. Strategies like cognitive-behavioral therapy provides stress-relief shield combats psychiatric illnesses which are additional benefits whereas combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pill formulation can supplement hormone deficiencies serves regulating menses simultaneously providing relief from cycle-related discomfort  In conclusion, this case involves an uncommon presentation of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea in a 14-year-old girl presenting with primary amenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain associated with menstrual cycles. Prompt recognition allows appropriate management focused on restoring hormonal balance through proper nutrition, counseling support to address underlying psychological stressors and maintaining a healthy lifestyle incorporating exercise. The involvement of specialists in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, and dietetics is crucial for the comprehensive management of such patients to improve their overall well-being.",continue
"Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000/mm³ and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.  Given the current global COVID-19 pandemic, the patient's clinical presentation raised suspicions of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, which confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.  The patient was promptly started on supplemental oxygen therapy to improve his oxygen saturation levels. Intravenous fluids and antipyretics were administered to manage his fever and maintain hydration. In addition, empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated due to concerns of secondary bacterial infection in severe COVID-19 cases.  Over the next few days, the patient's respiratory distress worsened despite receiving high-flow oxygen support. His oxygen saturation levels continued to decrease, necessitating transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). He required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.  Besides supportive care measures such as prone positioning and lung protective ventilation strategies utilized in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), additional therapies were initiated targeting inflammation associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient received a five-day course of intravenous dexamethasone as per recent clinical trial evidence showing its benefit in reducing mortality among those requiring mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen.  Despite aggressive treatment measures including ventilatory support and anti-inflammatory therapies, complications ensued over time as a result of both viral-induced inflammation and direct cellular injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient developed acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy alongside persistent hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation strategies.  Multiple laboratory investigations were conducted to assess organ function and potential complications. Results revealed elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathies, and cardiac biomarkers indicative of myocardial injury. The patient's clinical course was further complicated by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating the use of nitric oxide to improve oxygenation.  The patient remained in critical condition for several weeks with ongoing multiorgan dysfunction. Eventually, he succumbed to the severe complications associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and multiorgan failure.  This case highlights the devastating impact SARS-CoV-2 infection can have on individuals, especially those with severe presentations. Despite aggressive medical interventions and supportive care measures, some patients may experience a rapid decline in their clinical status due to various cumulative factors such as hyperinflammation, direct viral injury, and secondary infections.  Efforts are currently underway globally to improve outcomes through ongoing research into therapeutics such as antiviral agents, immunomodulatory treatments targeting inflammatory responses seen in severe cases like this patient's presentation. Vaccination campaigns are also being rolled out worldwide to prevent infections altogether or mitigate disease severity among vaccinated individuals if they do contract SARS-CoV-2.  As this pandemic evolves, it remains crucial for public health officials to emphasize preventive measures such as vaccination campaigns, face mask usage, hand hygiene practices alongside prompt identification and management of suspected cases through regular testing and contact tracing strategies aimed at curbing transmission rates until a higher proportion of the population is inoculated against COVID-19",continue
"The patient's medical history reveals that she had previously undergone VSD repair and PDA ligation. However, despite the successful procedures, she has been experiencing symptoms of failure to thrive along with fever and coughs. These recent symptoms were treated, and she has since made a full recovery.  Upon examination, the child's weight is a concern as she weighs only 5kgs. Her height is also noted to be below average at 70cm. The heart rate is elevated at 140b/m, respiratory rate is increased at 38 cycles/min, and blood pressure measures low at 80/50mmHg.  Auscultation reveals the presence of normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) along with a pansystolic murmur that can be heard throughout systole. Additionally, there is splitting of S2 heard during auscultation. Bilateral coarse crepitations are detected upon chest auscultation.  Despite these clinical findings, the patient remains conscious and alert throughout assessment. Other neurological examinations reveal normal findings such as equal bilaterally reactive pupils with a normal size ocular fundus examination (OFC) measuring 40cm. Global tone appears to be within expected limits with no signs of abnormal muscle stiffness or lack thereof noticed during observation. Muscle strength assessments reflect full power rating of 5 on all limbs.  Given this information about the patient's condition post-VSD repair and PDA ligation along with her current symptoms including failure to thrive and respiratory abnormalities like coarse crepitations bilaterally paired with an elevated heart rate; there are several potential underlying causes that could explain her clinical picture.  Firstly, it could be hypothesized that these symptoms may point towards respiratory distress associated with chronic lung disease or repeated pulmonary infections leading to ventilation-perfusion abnormalities observed through coarse crepitations in both lungs on chest auscultation.  Another possibility worth considering includes cardiac issues related to the previous VSD repair and PDA ligation. The presence of a pansystolic murmur, splitting of S2, and an elevated heart rate suggests the potential for residual or newly developed cardiac pathologies such as pulmonary valve insufficiency or right ventricular dysfunction. These could also contribute to her growth failure as well as contribute to her respiratory symptoms.  It is essential for further investigations to be conducted in order to rule out and distinguish between these possibilities effectively. Additional diagnostic modalities should include a chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC) and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). These tests will provide valuable insights into lung parenchymal involvement, cardiovascular abnormalities, possible infections or inflammatory states present within the patient.  In conclusion, this 1-year-old female presents with failure to thrive following VSD repair and PDA ligation. She had recently experienced fever and coughs but has now fully recovered from those symptoms. On examination, there are notable findings such as an elevated heart rate along with respiratory abnormalities including coarse crepitations bilaterally detected on chest auscultation. Further investigations are required utilizing diagnostic modalities such as chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and blood tests in order to determine the underlying cause most accurately so that appropriate management may be implemented accordingly for this young patient's welfare.",continue
"Postoperatively, the patient was put on a course of antibiotics and closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications. He was also advised to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle to manage his underlying conditions of hypertension and obesity.  Over the next few days, the patient showed marked improvement. His abdominal pain gradually subsided, and he reported feeling much better overall. The laboratory tests indicated that his inflammatory markers were decreasing, suggesting a resolution of the acute cholecystitis.  During his hospital stay, the patient received regular visits from the surgical team who closely monitored his progress. They ensured that he was managing his pain adequately and had no signs of postoperative complications such as infection or bile leak.  The pathology report confirmed that the gallbladder specimen removed during surgery contained gangrenous tissue with evidence of perforation. This finding reinforced the necessity for surgical intervention and removal of the diseased gallbladder.  As part of his postoperative care plan, a consultation with both a gastroenterologist and nutritionist was arranged for him before discharge. The gastroenterologist would oversee follow-up examinations to ensure optimal healing after surgery. The nutritionist would provide guidance on dietary modifications necessary to prevent future episodes while addressing obesity-related concerns as well.  Upon discharge, the patient was given specific instructions regarding wound care, medication management, activity restrictions, dietary modifications, signs/symptoms requiring immediate medical attention along with an appointment schedule for further follow-ups.  Throughout subsequent outpatient visits over several months following surgery recovery process remained uneventful except for occasional mild episodes of indigestion which improved upon careful dietary monitoring.  The patient made impressive progress in terms of overall health during subsequent follow-up appointments; he adhered faithfully to prescribed medication regimen along with incorporating significant lifestyle modifications including regular exercise routines facilitated by seeking professional guidance from physical therapists specialized in weight management issues secondary to severe/obesity problem involvement observed in this particular case due their ability to customize physical exercise plans for optimal outcomes considering uniqueness of patient's needs.  More specifically, his hypertension was well controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. His obesity, although still present, showed a significant reduction in BMI (Body Mass Index) due to the combined effects of surgery and dietary modifications. Furthermore, his gallbladder issues were resolved completely post-surgery, eliminating the need for further interventions.  In conclusion, the successful management of this 38-year-old male with acute gangrenous cholecystitis was achieved through prompt surgical intervention followed by appropriate postoperative care. The collaboration between surgical teams, gastroenterologists, nutritionists and other healthcare professionals played a crucial role in ensuring optimal outcomes for this patient. The case also highlighted the importance of addressing underlying conditions such as hypertension and obesity to prevent future complications while providing comprehensive care to the patient. Overall, this case serves as an example of how timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to favorable outcomes in patients with complex medical histories. The patient continued to follow up with his healthcare providers regularly, ensuring the maintenance of his overall health and the prevention of future complications. During these visits, ongoing management of his hypertension remained a priority. Medication adjustments were made as necessary to keep his blood pressure within a normal range.  Additionally, diet and lifestyle modifications were continually emphasized to help manage both his obesity and gallstone issues. The nutritionist worked closely with him to develop a meal plan that focused on whole foods, portion control, and reduction of saturated fats. Regular exercise was also encouraged to support weight loss efforts and improve cardiovascular health.  As time went on, the patient experienced significant improvements in both his physical health and quality of life. He reported fewer instances of abdominal discomfort or indigestion as he adhered to the recommended dietary guidelines.  Regular follow-up ultrasounds were conducted to monitor for any signs of gallstone recurrence or complications related to cholecystectomy. These imaging sessions provided reassurance that no further intervention was needed at that time.  The patient's commitment to sustained lifestyle changes proved instrumental in maintaining his progress over the long term. With ongoing guidance from healthcare professionals and regular check-ins with specialists involved in managing obesity-related concerns, he successfully managed not only acute cholecystitis but also other comorbidities associated with hypertension and obesity.  Additional support came from joining local support groups where individuals facing similar challenges could share their experiences and learn from each other's success stories. This sense of community helped boost morale during times when motivation might have waned.  As years passed following surgery, periodic evaluations showed sustained weight loss trends for our patient while hypercholesterolemia management remained successful through adherence medication therapy combined strict monitoring dietary cholesterol intake which significantly contributed further lowering serum levels targeting desirable values bringing overall cardiovascular risk level under much tighter control compared baseline status pre-surgery era.  In summary, this case demonstrated how thorough clinical evaluation coupled with timely surgical intervention can effectively manage a patient with acute cholecystitis, even in the presence of comorbid conditions such as hypertension and obesity. The multidisciplinary approach involving surgical teams, gastroenterologists, nutritionists, and support groups proved vital in achieving optimal outcomes for the patient.  Moreover, the long-term success relied heavily on the patient's commitment to sustained lifestyle changes and adherence to medication regimens. This case emphasizes not only the importance of addressing acute medical issues promptly but also highlights the significance of comprehensive care that considers underlying conditions to prevent future complications.  By providing guidance on healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and ongoing monitoring through follow-up visits with healthcare providers, patients can significantly improve their overall health outcomes and enhance their quality of life.",continue
"Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of the isolated swelling in the right parotid region. The patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and was currently undergoing iron supplementation. This information raised concerns about a potential correlation between the anemia and the parotid swelling.  Laboratory tests were performed, including a complete blood count (CBC), which showed persistent low hemoglobin levels despite iron supplementation. Additionally, serum ferritin levels were found to be abnormally low, further confirming an ongoing iron deficiency. These findings supported the initial diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in this patient.  To assess the nature of the parotid swelling, imaging studies were ordered. An ultrasound examination of the affected area revealed an enlarged right parotid gland with heterogeneous echogenicity compared to a normal contralateral gland. No evidence of fluid collection or abscess formation was noted.  Given these findings, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was recommended for further evaluation and to rule out malignancy or infection as potential causes for the swelling and associated lymphadenopathy. During FNAC, multiple aspirates were obtained from both parotid gland and lymph node samples.  Cytological analysis revealed benign salivary gland tissue in both specimens without any evidence of malignancy or infection. This confirmed that there was no tumor formation within the salivary glands but did not provide any definitive explanation for their enlargement.  Considering all clinical data and test results, it became evident that although there seemed to be no direct association between iron deficiency anemia and parotid swelling based on existing literature, further investigation into this unusual presentation was warranted due to its persistence over time.  Following consultations with various specialists including hematologists and otolaryngologists, it was decided that a comprehensive evaluation should be performed looking into other potential causes leading to these symptoms persistently observed in our patient.  One possible consideration is Sjogren's syndrome, as it is known to cause intractable parotid gland enlargement, though typically bilateral and associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth. Rheumatoid arthritis was also considered due to its association with salivary gland swelling, but the absence of other characteristic symptoms made this less likely.  An autoimmune workup was initiated to rule out any underlying autoimmune disorders that could be contributing to the parotid swelling. Additional blood tests were performed including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and Sjogren's syndrome-related markers such as anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies.  Furthermore, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck was conducted which revealed enlarged right parotid gland without any signs of mass effect on adjacent structures or lymphadenopathy beyond what had already been observed clinically.  At this point, the patient's case remained challenging and complex. Despite various diagnostic measures taken thus far, no definitive diagnosis had been reached regarding the cause of her isolated right parotid swelling. The team continued collaborating closely with different specialists involved to ensure a thorough investigation aiming at finding an accurate diagnosis for this unusual presentation in order to provide appropriate management for our patient. In order to explore all possible avenues, a multidisciplinary team was formed consisting of hematologists, otolaryngologists, rheumatologists, and radiologists. Regular meetings were held to discuss the patient's case and exchange ideas in an effort to unravel the mystery behind her persistent parotid swelling.  Given the benign nature of the cytological findings, it was decided that a biopsy of the affected parotid gland would provide valuable information and potentially shed light on the underlying cause. The biopsy was performed under local anesthesia with meticulous care to preserve nearby structures.  Histopathological examination revealed chronic sialadenitis with lymphocytic infiltrates in the parenchyma. There were no granulomas or evidence of malignancy observed. These findings supported an inflammatory etiology for the parotid swelling rather than neoplastic or infectious origins.  Based on these results, focus shifted to exploring various inflammatory conditions that could account for this presentation. One possibility considered was sarcoidosis due to its propensity for causing inflammation in salivary glands and associated lymph nodes. However, additional investigations including serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels and chest X-ray did not reveal any evidence of sarcoidosis.  Other options brought into consideration included Mikulicz syndrome and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), both known to involve salivary glands in a bilateral fashion along with other systemic manifestations. However, further diagnostic criteria needed to be met before definitively diagnosing these conditions.  In accordance with guidelines set by international experts in IgG4-RD diagnostic criteria - International consensus guidance statement on the management and treatment of IgG4-related disease - specific parameters such as elevated serum IgG4 levels (>135 mg/dL) and characteristic histopathological findings establishing dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates along with storiform fibrosis would need further assessment.  Additional serological tests targeting specific autoimmune conditions were performed, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and rheumatoid factor (RF). All these results came back negative.  With no definitive diagnosis despite extensive investigations, the patient's case remained a perplexing conundrum for the medical team. Discussions resumed with renewed vigor to explore other possibilities that may have been overlooked.  In the midst of this extensive evaluation, it was crucial to ensure that the patient received appropriate symptomatic relief. Conservative management measures such as warm compresses, massages, and good oral hygiene were implemented to alleviate discomfort caused by parotid swelling and associated symptoms.  Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor changes in symptomatology and assess for any complications or new developments. Patient education played a significant role in ensuring adherence to treatment plans and managing expectations as she navigated through this challenging phase of her medical journey.  As months went by with no definitive diagnosis in sight, it became increasingly apparent that this case would require collaboration not only within the multidisciplinary team but also with experts outside of their immediate scope such as rare disease specialists or immunologists who could provide fresh perspectives on this intricate puzzle.  The commitment remained unwavering – to identify the underlying cause behind this isolated parotid swelling so that appropriate management strategies could be implemented promptly. The hope was that continued exploration and consultation would ultimately lead them down a path towards answers for their patient.",continue
"However, shortly after his first birthday, the child experienced a sudden and severe illness. He developed a high fever, accompanied by vomiting and lethargy. Concerned, his parents immediately took him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain. The cause of the encephalitis was unclear but suspected to be viral.  The child's condition deteriorated rapidly over the next few days. He began having frequent seizures and his level of consciousness declined significantly. Despite all efforts to control the seizures and manage his symptoms, he suffered irreversible damage to his brain.  After several weeks in intensive care, he finally stabilized enough to be discharged from the hospital. However, it became evident that he had suffered significant neuroregression as a result of the encephalitis. Neuroregression is a term used when there is a loss or decline in previously acquired skills or abilities.  When he arrived at the physiotherapy department for evaluation and treatment, it was apparent that standing and walking were particularly challenging for him. The child had lost almost all motor function in his lower limbs and struggled with even basic tasks such as sitting independently.  Despite these setbacks, there were still some signs of hope in this young boy's story. Prior to falling ill on his first birthday, he had been progressing normally through developmental milestones for an infant. He achieved age-appropriate milestones such as sitting up without support and starting to take steps while holding onto furniture.  These early developmental successes provide valuable information about what this child may still be capable of achieving despite his current limitations. With proper therapy interventions focused on retraining motor skills and strengthening muscle groups related to standing and walking, there is reason to believe that progress can be made.  The physiotherapy team devised an individualized treatment plan tailored specifically for this child's needs. It included exercises focused not only on rebuilding strength in leg muscles but also on improving balance and coordination.  The child's parents were actively involved in the therapy sessions, learning techniques to continue working with their son at home. They were committed to doing whatever they could to help him regain his ability to stand and walk independently.  Weeks turned into months, and small but significant improvements began to emerge. With consistency and perseverance from both the physiotherapy team and the child's parents, he started showing signs of regained strength in his lower limbs.  First, he was able to bear weight on his legs for brief periods with support. Next, he began taking assisted steps while holding onto someone's hands or using a walker. Over time, these steps grew steadier and more confident.  Eventually, after months of hard work and dedication from everyone involved in his care, the young boy achieved a major milestone - standing independently for the first time since falling ill. The joy on his face was priceless as he realized that he had accomplished something that once seemed impossible.  While walking independently is still a work in progress for him, this child continues to make remarkable strides towards regaining mobility. He is a testament not only to the resilience of children but also to the power of early intervention therapy in improving outcomes for patients with neurological conditions.  His story is not yet complete as there are still challenges ahead on his path towards full recovery. However, armed with determination and unwavering support from those around him, there is no doubt that this young boy will continue surpassing expectations one step at a time. And through it all, he serves as an inspiration - reminding us all never to give up hope even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles",continue
"Upon arrival at the hospital, the neonate appeared to be in stable condition. He weighed 2.8 kg and had a head circumference of 34 cm. The mother reported that she had experienced a smooth labor with no complications. However, upon examination, it became evident that the infant had a congenital abdominal wall malformation.  A thorough physical examination revealed a large defect in the abdominal wall located on the right side near the umbilicus. The content of the abdomen appeared to be protruding through this defect, suggesting an omphalocele. Omphalocele is a type of congenital abdominal wall defect characterized by an opening in which some or all of the intra-abdominal organs herniate into a sac covered by peritoneum.  Further investigations were requested to assess any associated anomalies and ensure appropriate management planning. An abdominal ultrasound was performed and confirmed that there was no associated malformation or torsion of organs within the herniated sac.  The medical team discussed various treatment options for this case. As it was suspected that there might be underlying genetic abnormalities contributing to this congenital defect, genetic counseling was offered to both parents prior to proceeding with any surgical intervention.  Genetic counseling plays a crucial role in these cases as it provides insight into potential risk factors for future pregnancies and aids parents in making informed decisions regarding family planning.  After extensive discussions with the parents, they opted for surgical repair of their infant's omphalocele due to concerns about potential complications if left untreated.  The surgical team prepared meticulously for corrective surgery taking into consideration several factors including stabilization of vital signs before anesthesia induction and administration of prophylactic antibiotics.  During surgery, great care was taken while handling exposed viscera within the sac during reduction back into their normal intra-abdominal position making sure not to cause unnecessary trauma or injury which could potentially compromise organ functionality.  Once all contents were adequately reduced back into place inside his abdomen, primary closure using multiple layers of sutures was performed to reinforce the abdominal wall defect.  Postoperatively, the infant's vital signs were closely monitored in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Antibiotics, analgesics, and enteral feeds were administered as per protocol.  The overall recovery following surgery was uneventful. The infant underwent regular follow-up visits with pediatric surgeons, neonatologists, and genetic counselors to ensure appropriate healing and growth. The parents received guidance on wound care at home and information about long-term outcomes for their child's condition.  With proper medical intervention and support from healthcare professionals, this newborn had a good prognosis. However, it is important to acknowledge that infants with abdominal wall malformations may experience long-term consequences such as gastrointestinal issues or developmental delays that will require ongoing management throughout childhood.  In conclusion, prompt diagnosis and early surgical intervention are crucial in managing congenital abdominal wall malformations like omphalocele. Collaboration among various medical specialties including pediatric surgeons, neonatologists, genetic counselors ensures comprehensive care for both the newborns and their families throughout the treatment journey. The case of this 8-hours-old male neonate with a congenital abdominal wall malformation highlights the importance of prenatal care and diligent monitoring during pregnancy. Although the mother did not have any chronic pathologies or consanguinity, her lack of proper antenatal care could have contributed to the development of this condition.  Congenital abdominal wall malformations can arise due to various factors, including genetic abnormalities, exposure to certain medications or toxins during pregnancy, and disruptions in embryonic development. It is crucial for healthcare providers to emphasize the significance of regular check-ups and prenatal screenings to identify any potential issues early on.  In this particular case, since the omphalocele was an isolated finding without associated malformations or organ torsion, it suggests that there might not be underlying chromosomal abnormalities involved. However, further genetic counseling and testing may still be advisable to rule out any other potential genetic predispositions that may affect future pregnancies.  The successful surgical repair performed on this neonate highlights the advances in pediatric surgery and postoperative management techniques. The multidisciplinary approach involving pediatric surgeons, neonatologists, and genetic counselors ensures comprehensive care for both the infant and their family.  Long-term follow-up is essential for infants with congenital abdominal wall malformations. Regular assessment by healthcare professionals allows for monitoring growth and development milestones as well as addressing any potential complications that may arise over time.  It is important for parents to understand that even after surgical correction, there may be long-term consequences associated with these types of conditions. The impact on gastrointestinal function or delays in developmental milestones should not be overlooked. Early intervention programs such as physical therapy or occupational therapy can play a significant role in helping these children reach their full potential.  Furthermore, ongoing support from medical professionals is crucial in guiding parents through challenges they might face while caring for an infant with a congenital abnormality. Providing education about wound care at home along with emotional support helps parents feel more confident in their ability to care for their child's specific needs.  In conclusion, the case of this newborn with a congenital abdominal wall malformation underscores the importance of proper prenatal care, early diagnosis, and timely intervention. The collaboration among various medical specialties ensures that these infants receive comprehensive and personalized care to optimize their outcomes. With ongoing monitoring and support, these children have a better chance at leading healthy and fulfilling lives.",continue
"Upon initial examination, the patient displayed signs consistent with lumbosacral radiculopathy, such as radiating pain to the right leg and low back pain. These symptoms had persisted for two months prior to admission and had not responded fully to NSAID treatment. However, within the past two weeks, her condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to paraparesis (partial paralysis) and urinary dysfunction.  Considering the sudden onset of paraparesis and urinary dysfunction in conjunction with previous radiculopathy symptoms, further investigations were warranted. A thorough neurological examination revealed a predominant right-sided paraparesis with a muscle strength grade of 3 out of 5. Sensory testing indicated impairment below the umbilicus level, suggesting spinal nerve involvement at or below this point. Additionally, genitourinary sphincter dysfunction was observed.  To identify the underlying cause of these developments, several diagnostic procedures were initiated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine was performed to evaluate any anatomical abnormalities that could account for the presenting symptoms. The MRI revealed a significant disc herniation at L4-L5 level compressing the spinal nerve roots on both sides.  The MRI findings confirmed suspicion regarding compression-induced radiculopathy as an explanation for the patient's earlier symptoms. More importantly though, it indicated a progression in severity resulting in acute spinal cord compression responsible for her worsening clinical condition.  Prompt intervention was deemed necessary to alleviate pressure on neural structures and prevent further deterioration or permanent damage. An interdisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons collaborated on planning a surgical approach suitable for decompressing affected nerve roots while minimizing potential complications.  A laminectomy procedure was chosen as it would provide optimal access to remove compressive lesions without compromising structural integrity. During surgery well-tolerated under general anesthesia using intraoperative neuromonitoring techniques epidural space expansion from L1-L2- to S1, and decompression of the affected nerve roots were carried out.  Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely for any immediate complications while receiving appropriate pain management and maintaining strict bed rest. Within a few hours after surgery, she demonstrated noticeable improvements in motor function, with muscle strength now at 4 out of 5 on the right side. Additionally, sensory deficits below the umbilicus started to resolve gradually.  The following day marked a further enhancement in her condition. Her motor function improved to 4+/5 and sensory disturbances were reduced to only slight hypoesthesia below the umbilicus level. Urinary dysfunction also showed signs of improvement with better control and decreased urgency.  Over subsequent days, active physical therapy was initiated to prevent muscular atrophy and regain maximum mobility. By engaging in various exercises targeting both upper and lower extremities, muscle strength was consistently improving along with coordination skills.  Throughout her hospital stay, multiple follow-up examinations indicated significant progress without any setbacks or complications observed. The patient's Karnovsky performance status increased from 50% on admission to an estimated level above 80%. Furthermore, genitourinary sphincter dysfunction resolved entirely within two weeks since surgical intervention.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention when patients present with progressive neurological symptoms associated with radiculopathy. Timely surgical decompression can effectively relieve pressure on neural structures leading to significant improvements even when severe neurological deficits have already developed. Successful outcomes can be achieved through interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals while prioritizing personalized care tailored towards each individual's needs during post-operative rehabilitation as well as long-term management strategies for optimal recovery.

"His weight and height were within the normal range for his age. However, upon closer inspection, several physical abnormalities were observed. The boy had a small head circumference, with widely spaced eyes and a flat nasal bridge. His ears were low-set and appeared malformed. Additionally, he had a cleft palate and bilateral clinodactyly (curvature) of the fifth finger.  Given the presence of multiple congenital anomalies, further investigations were warranted to determine the underlying cause. An abdominal ultrasound was performed to assess for any internal organ abnormalities, but no significant findings were noted. The patient's bloodwork came back within normal limits as well.  Considering the range of anomalies seen in this child and their involvement in different body systems (craniofacial, musculoskeletal), syndromic etiologies needed to be explored. Genetic testing was recommended to evaluate for any chromosomal abnormalities or specific gene mutations related to known syndromes.  Upon receiving the genetic test results about two weeks later, it was revealed that the child carried a de novo mutation in a gene associated with Stickler syndrome type I-IV (a connective tissue disorder). Stickler syndrome is characterized by various features including craniofacial anomalies (such as cleft palate), joint hypermobility or stiffness, ocular manifestations (retinal detachments) and hearing impairment.  The parents were counseled about Stickler syndrome's autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but reassured that their other children most likely did not carry the same mutation since it occurred spontaneously in this case. Detailed information regarding potential complications associated with Stickler syndrome over time—such as retinal detachments requiring ophthalmologic monitoring—were provided to ensure optimal care for their son.  In addition to management plans related specifically to Stickler syndrome-related concerns such as regular ophthalmologic evaluations, feeding assistance aimed at improving oral intake due to his cleft palate was arranged by consulting an interdisciplinary team consisting of a speech and language therapist, pediatric dietician, and an otolaryngologist.  The child's developmental milestones were closely tracked to identify any delays early on. Early intervention services were introduced to address potential gross or fine motor delays and ensure he receives the support necessary for his overall development.  Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his growth, development, and any additional complications that might arise due to Stickler syndrome. The parents were encouraged to reach out with any concerns or questions between appointments so that appropriate guidance could be provided promptly.  Although the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome presented challenges for this young boy and his family, proper management strategies including multidisciplinary care, genetic counseling, and targeted interventions would go a long way in helping him thrive despite his congenital anomalies. With ongoing support from healthcare professionals and his dedicated parents, the future appeared hopeful for this little boy as he embarked on his unique journey with Stickler syndrome. As the months went by, the young boy continued to show signs of growth and development. With the assistance of feeding interventions and therapies, his ability to open his mouth wider during eating and crying gradually improved. The interdisciplinary team worked together to address any challenges that arose, ensuring that he received the necessary support throughout his early years.  Regular ophthalmologic evaluations were conducted as part of his overall care plan for Stickler syndrome. Although retinal detachments are a potential complication associated with this disorder, it was crucial to monitor his eye health closely. By catching any issues early on, prompt interventions could be implemented to preserve his vision and prevent further complications.  In addition to medical management, psychological support was also offered to both the child and his family. Coping with a diagnosis like Stickler syndrome can be overwhelming for parents. Providing them with resources, emotional support, and connecting them with support groups allowed them to navigate their journey with a strong network of individuals who understood their experiences.  As he grew older, specialized education programs were introduced tailored specifically for children with special needs or developmental delays associated with Stickler syndrome. These programs focused on enhancing both academic skills and social interactions while adapting teaching methods according to each child's unique abilities.  Genetic counseling sessions were held regularly for the parents as well so they could fully understand their chances of passing on the mutation if they planned future pregnancies. It was important for them to have all the necessary information about recurrence risks and potential prenatal genetic testing options available.  Over time, as advancements in medical research continued, new treatment options emerged for individuals living with Stickler syndrome. The healthcare team remained vigilant in staying updated on these developments so they could provide comprehensive care recommendations based on best practices.  Despite facing some challenges along the way due to congenital anomalies associated with Stickler syndrome, this young boy demonstrated remarkable resilience as he thrived under proper management strategies implemented by a dedicated healthcare team working closely alongside committed parents who went above and beyond to ensure he had the best possible quality of life.  As he reached milestone after milestone, his progress served as an inspiration not only to those involved in his care but also to others facing similar challenges.

The journey was not always easy, but with a strong support system in place, this young boy continued to face each obstacle head-on. His story highlighted the importance of comprehensive care for individuals with rare genetic disorders like Stickler syndrome and gave hope that despite initial concerns at birth, a fulfilling life could still be achieved through collaborative efforts between medical professionals and loving families.",continue
"Baby AO's admission into the special care baby unit was necessary due to severe pre-eclampsia and severe intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) that were detected during the mother's caesarian delivery at a gestational age of 35 weeks. The newborn's low birth weight of 1.2 kg and physical appearance indicated signs of fetal malnutrition.  Upon admission, Baby AO exhibited good activity but had difficulty breathing and low blood sugar levels, both of which were managed appropriately by the medical team. The baby did not show any signs of jaundice or organ enlargement upon examination.  A full blood count was performed on Baby AO, revealing mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 97x10^9/L. There was also evidence of relative lymphocytosis, indicating an increased proportion of lymphocytes in the bloodstream. However, the hemoglobin level was normal at 45%. Additionally, serum electrolyte levels were within their expected ranges.  The medical team closely monitored Baby AO's progress and initiated appropriate interventions to address his specific needs. Nutritional support played a crucial role in aiding his growth and development considering his initial signs of fetal malnutrition.  To address his dyspnea (difficulty breathing), respiratory support such as oxygen therapy may have been provided initially while assessing the underlying cause or determining if there were any associated respiratory complications present. It is important to note that this aspect was managed appropriately by the healthcare professionals attending to him.  Additionally, measures were taken to stabilize Baby AO's blood glucose levels since he presented with hypoglycemia upon admission. This would include careful monitoring and administration of intravenous fluids containing glucose as needed until his body could regulate its own blood sugar levels properly.  The mild thrombocytopenia detected through full blood count results may have been closely monitored for potential implications such as bleeding tendencies or increased susceptibility to infections necessitating further management by the medical team.  Baby AO's overall physical appearance, aside from the signs of fetal malnutrition, did not show any significant abnormalities upon admission. However, regular monitoring of his growth and development would continue during his stay in the special care baby unit to address any potential concerns that may arise during this critical period for proper neonatal growth.  The specialized care provided in the Babcock University Teaching Hospital's special care baby unit ensured Baby AO received appropriate medical attention for his specific needs. The healthcare professionals closely monitored his progress through regular check-ups, administered necessary interventions when necessary, and upheld a multidisciplinary approach to his care ensuring all aspects of his health were addressed.  As Baby AO continued to receive specialized care and support within the unit, it was anticipated that he would gradually improve in terms of respiratory status, blood sugar regulation, weight gain and overall health. With consistent monitoring and intervention as needed from skilled healthcare professionals within this setting dedicated to caring for newborns with unique medical needs such as Baby AO's conditions, positive outcomes were expected if a successful adaptation was maintained. During Baby AO's stay in the special care baby unit, efforts were made to address his nutritional needs and promote healthy growth and development. Since he exhibited signs of fetal malnutrition, a carefully tailored feeding plan was implemented. This plan likely involved a combination of breast milk, either directly from the mother or through expressed milk, fortified with additional nutrients to provide him with the necessary calories and nutrients for proper growth.  The medical team closely monitored Baby AO's weight gain and growth trajectory to ensure that he was gaining weight at an appropriate rate. Regular measurements of his length and head circumference were taken as well, as these are crucial indicators of a baby's overall development.  In addition to nutrition management, Baby AO would have received specialized care to support his respiratory function. This might have included continuous monitoring of his oxygen saturation levels as well as interventions such as gentle suctioning or supplemental oxygen therapy if needed. The healthcare team would have closely watched for any signs of respiratory distress or complications that could arise due to prematurity or lung immaturity related to IUGR.  Throughout Baby AO's stay in the special care baby unit, his blood glucose levels would have been carefully monitored and managed. Hypoglycemia is common among premature infants with IUGR due to their limited glucose stores. Regular blood sugar checks would be performed using a small lancet on the baby's heel and adjustments made in intravenous glucose infusion rates when needed.  To address mild thrombocytopenia detected in Baby AO's full blood count results, further investigations may have been conducted by ordering repeat platelet counts over time or additional tests such as coagulation studies or bone marrow examinations if warranted. The aim would be to determine whether this was transient due to prematurity or if it indicated an underlying condition requiring treatment.  In addition to medical interventions provided within the special care baby unit setting, family-centered care would also play an essential role in supporting Baby AO's well-being. The medical team would have encouraged the parents to be actively involved in their baby's care, providing education and support to ensure they felt empowered in understanding their child's condition and needs.  As Baby AO continued to receive specialized care, it was expected that he would gradually improve in terms of respiratory function, blood sugar regulation, weight gain, and overall health. The focus of the medical team would be not only on managing his immediate health issues but also on preparing him for a smooth transition home when he reached an appropriate level of stability.  In summary, Baby AO's admission into the special care baby unit was necessary due to severe pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation. Through careful monitoring, tailored nutritional support, respiratory management, glucose regulation, and family-centered care within the special care unit setting at Babcock University Teaching Hospital in Ilishan Nigeria it was likely that Baby AO had a good chance of improving his overall health outcomes with time. With a multidisciplinary approach from skilled healthcare professionals who were attentive to his unique needs as a premature infant with IUGR complications like Baby AO hopes were high for positive outcomes throughout this critical period of neonatal development.",continue
"Upon arrival at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), the 37-year-old woman, accompanied by her husband, was taken through the appropriate screening processes to ensure the safety of both patients and healthcare providers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This included temperature checks, a detailed interview about symptoms and travel history, as well as a review of any possible exposure to infected individuals.  Given her recent close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, it was crucial to determine her infection status before proceeding with any surgical intervention. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for RT-PCR testing, which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. The test would provide definitive results regarding her infection status.  While waiting for the test results to come back, other preparations for the caesarean delivery were underway. The obstetric team reviewed her previous medical records in detail to understand any potential challenges that might arise during surgery due to her two previous caesarean sections and abdominal myomectomy.  The woman had followed regular antenatal care throughout her pregnancy without any significant issues. Ultrasonography had confirmed that she was carrying a single fetus, which further reassured both herself and the medical team regarding potential complications during delivery.  As healthcare professionals continued their daily routines amidst an escalating global health crisis, strict protocols were in place at LUTH to ensure that all patients received optimal care while minimizing risks associated with COVID-19 transmission within healthcare settings. All staff members involved in patient care wore personal protective equipment (PPE) meticulously and ensured adherence to hand hygiene guidelines before interacting with patients or entering designated areas.  A separate operating theatre designed specifically for suspected or known cases of COVID-19 had been established at LUTH since the emergence of this novel virus. This dedicated space aimed at reducing contamination risks within high-risk procedures such as surgeries while providing efficient care tailored towards preventing cross-transmission among patients and healthcare workers.  The woman had reported no symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, which was a positive sign. However, as the wait for the test results continued, anxiety loomed heavy over her and her husband. The uncertainty surrounding her infection status and the potential impact it could have on both mother and baby's health were difficult to bear.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the woman received a call from her obstetrician informing her that she tested negative for COVID-19. Relief washed over both of them as they realized that their fears would not manifest into reality.  With the confirmation of a negative test result, plans for an elective caesarean section at 38 weeks' gestation resumed. A team of skilled healthcare professionals prepared to perform the surgery in accordance with established guidelines while ensuring all necessary precautions were implemented to keep everyone involved safe.  The woman was later escorted into the dedicated operating theatre where meticulous planning had taken place prior to her arrival. The obstetricians swiftly yet gently delivered a healthy baby through an uneventful caesarean procedure. The newborn cried loudly upon arrival into this world, much to everyone's delight.  Postoperative care was provided in line with standard protocols while continuing vigilance against COVID-19 transmission within hospital grounds remained paramount. The mother relished in holding her newborn while feeling immense gratitude towards everyone who played a role in their safe passage through this challenging period.  As they left LUTH later on with their precious bundle of joy cradled tightly in their arms, they knew that they had faced adversity head-on and emerged stronger from it. It was yet another testament to human resilience amid uncertain times brought about by an unprecedented pandemic that had reshaped lives around them. ",continue
"Upon further examination, the patient appeared pale and slightly emaciated. Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius. Physical examination revealed a firm and non-tender mass palpable in the right hypochondrial region.  Medical history was unremarkable except for a previous episode of chronic hepatitis B infection, which had been treated successfully with antiviral medications two years ago. The patient denied any history of alcohol abuse or risky sexual behavior that could have contributed to viral transmission. Her family history was positive for colon cancer in her father who passed away from the disease at age 62.  Given the patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination, further investigations were warranted. A complete blood count showed mild anemia (hemoglobin level: 10 g/dL) and normal white blood cell count (7.5 x10^9/L). Liver function tests were within normal limits except for elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (200 U/L). Tumor markers such as CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and CA19-9 were ordered but results would not be available until later.  An abdominal ultrasound was performed to assess the nature of the abdominal mass. The ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions in both lobes consistent with metastatic disease. No obvious lesions or abnormality was noted in other organs within the field of view.  Based on these findings, suspicion for malignancy was high; specifically liver metastasis from an unknown primary source given no known history or symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer at this stage apart from family history predisposition.  The patient underwent a CT scan to further characterize the hepatic lesions while searching for potential primary tumors elsewhere in her body that could have given rise to metastasis. The scan revealed an enlarged liver with numerous enhancing nodules, some of which measured up to 5 cm in diameter. No primary tumor was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, ovaries, or breast.  Considering the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and family history of colon cancer, a colonoscopy was recommended. During the procedure, a large ulcerated mass encasing more than two-thirds of the circumference of the ascending colon was identified. Biopsies were taken for histopathological analysis.  Histopathology revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the colonic mucosa and extending into deeper layers of the bowel wall. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed an origin from colonic tissue and ruled out other primary sites such as stomach or pancreas.  Given this diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer with hepatic metastasis at initial presentation and based on her overall fitness for surgery as determined by further evaluation including cardiac assessment via electrocardiography/echocardiography plus abdominal-pelvic CT scan to rule out locally unresectable disease or disseminated peritoneal sites infiltration/omental involvement; she will be offered systemic chemotherapy upfront before considering surgical intervention since surgery alone is curative when hepatic metastases are confined to one lobe mainly isolated to left side (segment II-VIII) while systemic therapy options revolve around adding biological-based therapies like EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) inhibitors being added to FOLFOX (Leucovorin Calcium /Fluorouracil/Oxaliplatin) backbone chemotherapy depending on current biomarker status; further diagnostic tests including molecular testing for RAS gene mutations will be performed since judgement regarding adding EGFR inhibition depends on testing results```",continue
"The symptoms exhibited by the 12-year-old girl, including abdominal pain, high persistent fever, severe fatigue, pallor, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and grade III splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), raise concerns about a potential underlying condition. Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of these symptoms.  One of the initial tests performed was a complete blood count (CBC) which revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 545,000/mm³. This finding indicated leukocytosis or an increased number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood. The differential count showed that out of the total WBC count, 49,050/mm³ were neutrophils (PNN). Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell involved in fighting bacterial infections.   However, alongside this increase in white blood cells and neutrophils was another concerning finding on the peripheral smear: 21% blasts. Blasts are immature cells that should not be present in significant numbers in peripheral blood as they are typically found within the bone marrow where they mature into various types of cells such as red and white blood cells and platelets.  To aid diagnosis further, additional molecular testing was carried out to assess for any genetic abnormalities linked to hematological disorders. The analysis focused on detecting BCR-ABL rearrangement responsible for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). In this case, it revealed that 94% BCR-ABL-positive blasts were present in her peripheral blood.  Based on these findings from both CBC analysis and molecular testing results for BCR-ABL rearrangement associated with Ph+ ALL – acute lymphoblastic leukemia – a diagnosis could be reached indicating that this young girl had developed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with significant involvement observed in her bone marrow leading to marked leukocytosis.  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow characterized by the rapid production of immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts. It is commonly observed in children between the ages of 2 to 5 years, although it can occur at any age.  Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), which was detected in this case, occurs when there is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This genetic alteration leads to the fusion of two genes: BCR (breakpoint cluster region) and ABL1 (Abelson proto-oncogene 1). The resultant fusion protein product, BCR-ABL1, has constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity that promotes abnormal proliferation and survival of leukemic cells.  Treatment for Ph+ ALL often involves a combination of chemotherapy drugs along with targeted therapy agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors specifically designed to inhibit the activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. These targeted therapies have shown significant success in improving outcomes for patients with Ph+ ALL.  Upon diagnosis, it would be critical to initiate treatment promptly given the aggressive nature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The young girl would require close monitoring by a multidisciplinary medical team consisting of pediatric oncologists, hematologists, nurses specializing in pediatric hematology-oncology care along with proper psychosocial support services catering to both her medical needs along with emotional well-being during this difficult time.  With advancements made over recent years in understanding Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and availability of effective targeted therapy options such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib or dasatinib alongside conventional chemotherapeutic regimens involving corticosteroids and vincristine could provide hope for successful remission induction leading towards cure. Nonetheless early detection coupled proactive management protocols continue playing pivotal role optimizing prognosis for patients including children coping with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",continue
"After the successful surgery, the patient returned to Ghana and continued her life with a new lease on health. However, the difficulties and challenges of living with a congenital heart defect in a developing country were far from over. Access to proper medical care and ongoing follow-up was limited, as there were no specialized cardiac centers in Ghana at that time.  Realizing the urgent need for comprehensive cardiac care facilities within their borders, a group of dedicated individuals worked tirelessly to establish the National Cardiothoracic Centre. With support from both local and international organizations, including charitable foundations and medical professionals from around the world, this groundbreaking center was brought to fruition.  The aim of the National Cardiothoracic Centre was two-fold: provide state-of-the-art cardiac treatment for Ghanaians in need while also building up local expertise through training programs for healthcare professionals. The center's inauguration marked a turning point in Ghanaian healthcare, as it signaled that high-quality cardiac care could be provided within its own borders.  One of the main objectives of establishing this center was to ensure that Ghanaians with congenital heart defects no longer had to rely solely on overseas philanthropy for treatment. In addition to providing surgical interventions for children like our patient who had traveled abroad years before, it also aimed to provide early diagnosis and intervention for infants born with critical congenital heart diseases.  With its experienced team of surgeons, cardiologists, nurses, and other allied healthcare professionals trained both locally and internationally, the National Cardiothoracic Centre became a beacon of hope for countless Ghanaians affected by cardiovascular conditions. It not only performed complex surgeries such as open-heart procedures but also offered non-invasive diagnostic services like echocardiography and stress tests.  However, establishing such an advanced facility came with numerous challenges. Accessible funding was crucial not only for equipment acquisition but also in recruiting highly skilled personnel capable of managing these sophisticated technologies effectively. The government recognized the importance of investing in cardiac care and began allocating a portion of the national budget towards expanding and improving these services.  Over time, the National Cardiothoracic Centre has become a model for cardiac care in sub-Saharan Africa. Its success has inspired neighboring countries to set up similar centers, facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration throughout the region. This collaborative spirit extends beyond borders as international organizations have also partnered with the center to provide financial aid and expertise.  In recent years, advancements in medical technology have allowed for more minimally invasive procedures to be performed at the National Cardiothoracic Centre. These techniques reduce recovery times and hospital stays while maintaining excellent outcomes for patients. This development particularly benefited adults who previously might have been unable to access specialized treatment due to age restrictions placed on certain interventions.  The inspiring journey of Ghana's National Cardiothoracic Centre serves as a testament to what can be achieved when individuals come together with a common goal. From its humble beginnings as a dream fueled by philanthropy, it has grown into a world-class facility that saves lives daily.  As Ghana continues its stride towards universal healthcare access, especially in underserved areas, expansions are being made within the National Cardiothoracic Center itself. Satellite clinics are being established across different regions within Ghana to ensure that even those from remote areas can receive timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention.  Furthermore, research initiatives are underway at the center in collaboration with local universities and international partners to understand congenital heart defects better among Ghanaians while also exploring innovative treatment options.  The story of this patient serves as a reminder of how far Ghana's healthcare system has come since she was four years old. Thanks to philanthropic efforts which initiated her path towards healing overseas and subsequent advancements locally at the National Cardiothoracic Centre - her life was transformed forever; an example of hope realized not only for her but countless others who have benefited from this remarkable institution's work.",continue
"Upon examination, the healthcare providers at the center noticed multiple ulcers on the girl's buttocks. The ulcers were deep and extensive, with irregular ragged edges. Some areas of the ulcers appeared infected and had pus-filled discharge.  After assessing her medical history and conducting a thorough physical examination, a diagnosis of Buruli ulcer was suspected. Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, a bacterium that affects skin and soft tissues. It primarily affects communities living in rural areas near rivers or wetlands.  To confirm their suspicion, the healthcare providers decided to perform laboratory tests on a sample of tissue from one of the ulcers. The sample was sent to a nearby laboratory for further analysis.  While awaiting the results, treatment was initiated for both leprosy and Buruli ulcer to cover all possible diagnoses due to overlapping clinical presentations between these two diseases.  The girl was started on antibiotics specifically designed to treat both conditions – rifampicin and clarithromycin. In addition to this antibiotic therapy, wound care management was crucial in promoting healing and preventing further infection.  The healthcare team educated the girl's parents about proper wound care techniques such as washing hands before touching her wounds, cleaning the wounds with sterile saline solution daily followed by dressing changes using sterile gauze pads. They emphasized not reusing dressings or applying herbal medicines as they can interfere with healing or even worsen infections.  A week later, when the test results came back from the laboratory confirming it as Buruli ulcer without any evidence of leprosy infection; treatment could be adjusted accordingly based on these findings by discontinuing rifampicin which is especially effective against leprosy bacilli but not against Mycobacterium ulcerans causing Buruli ulcer; clarithromycin continued solely one day per at 7 days weekly dosing according WHO guidelines for children less than 15 years old having no severe disease or complications.  The girl's parents were relieved to have a definitive diagnosis and a treatment plan in place. They diligently followed the wound care instructions given by the healthcare providers, making sure her ulcers were kept clean and dressed properly.  Over the following months, the girl's ulcers slowly began to improve. The deep ulcers started to heal from the bottom upwards, gradually filling with healthy granulation tissue. The irregular ragged edges of the ulcers became smoother as new skin started to grow.  During this time period, regular follow-up visits at the screening center allowed healthcare providers to monitor her progress and adjust treatment if necessary. Any signs of potential complications such as secondary infections were promptly addressed by providing appropriate medical interventions.  As months went by, the healing process continued steadily, much to everyone's relief. After almost a year of continuous treatment and care, her ulcers finally closed completely without any evidence of residual skin damage or deformity.  The little girl had overcome a challenging period in her life thanks to early diagnosis and timely intervention from skilled healthcare providers at the center for screening and treatment of leprosy and Buruli ulcer. Her case served as an example that raising awareness about neglected tropical diseases is crucial in preventing long-term disabilities caused by these conditions. ",continue
"On further investigation, the patient's cranial nerves were found to be intact except for left-sided facial weakness (lower motor neuron type), indicating involvement of the seventh cranial nerve. His motor power was normal in all four limbs, and no sensory deficits were observed. However, a thorough evaluation of his speech revealed slurred and indistinct articulation, confirming the presence of dysarthria.  Given these findings, a provisional diagnosis of bulbar palsy was made. Bulbar palsy refers to an impairment of function or paralysis of the muscles innervated by cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), XI (accessory), XII (hypoglossal) which are involved in phonation and swallowing. This condition can result from various etiologies including vascular events, degenerative disorders, tumors, infections or trauma.  Nasal regurgitation and dysphagia reported by the patient pointed towards dysfunction in his ability to swallow food properly without difficulty or choking episodes. Dysphagia can result from weakness or impaired coordination between the muscles involved in swallowing – specifically those innervated by cranial nerves IX and X.  Investigations including blood tests and imaging studies were carried out to determine the underlying cause for this patient's symptoms. Routine blood exams such as complete blood count, serum electrolytes levels along with renal profile showed no abnormality. Imaging studies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of brain with contrast enhancement was performed revealing bilateral medial medullary infarct involving hypoglossal nucleus on both sides  The prognosis for patients with bulbar palsy greatly depends on its etiology as well as early detection and prompt management initiation are essential to improve outcomes. In this case, it was evident that an ischemic event had affected the brainstem resulting in bilateral lesions within the hypoglossal nucleus – responsible for controlling movements associated with tongue functions.  Collaboration with specialists from various fields such as neurology, otolaryngology, and speech pathology was necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to the patient's specific needs. Initially, the management involved supportive measures like close monitoring of vital signs and ensuring adequate nutrition via nasogastric tube feeding.  Rehabilitation therapy including swallowing exercises facilitated by a speech pathologist played a crucial role in retraining the patient's muscles involved in swallowing. Strategies were implemented to enhance tongue strength and coordination while chewing and swallowing food. Regular practice sessions were carried out under the supervision of the speech pathologist to improve articulation and intelligibility of speech.  The patient's compliance with medications for systemic hypertension was emphasized during follow-up visits. It is important for individuals with chronic medical conditions like hypertension to regularly monitor blood pressure levels, adhere to prescribed medications, make appropriate dietary changes, maintain an active lifestyle, and attend regular check-ups.  Over time, there was gradual improvement observed in this patient's symptoms. Dysphagia resolved completely after two months of intensive rehabilitation therapy and normal diet along with oral medications could be resumed without any difficulty or risk of aspiration pneumonia due to choking episodes. However, residual dysarthria persisted but showed mild improvement with ongoing speech therapy sessions.  It is worth mentioning that this case highlighted not only the importance of early diagnosis but also timely initiation of management strategies involving interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals specialized in various aspects related to bulbar palsy. Long-term follow-up care remains critical for monitoring potential complications or relapses associated with this condition.  In conclusion, bulbar palsy can present as dysphagia, nasal regurgitation on eating and dysarthria due to bilateral medial medullary infarct involving hypoglossal nucleus following ischemic events. Timely diagnosis aided by neurological examinations aongside imaging studies can guide appropriate management strategies which involve supportive measures including rehabilitation therapy aimed at improving swallowing and speech functions. Regular follow-up and compliance with medications are crucial for optimizing long-term outcomes in patients with bulbar palsy.",continue
"Upon learning about the patient's history and observing the physical condition of her hands, our team of prosthetists began to assess potential solutions to improve her quality of life. The primary goal was to restore the functionality and aesthetics of both hands through the use of prosthetic devices.  The first step was to create an individualized treatment plan that would address each hand separately. For the right hand, which had amputations on multiple fingers, we decided that a myoelectric prosthetic device would be most suitable. This type of prosthesis utilizes sensors placed on the residual muscles in order to detect electrical signals generated by muscle contractions. These signals are then translated into movements within the prosthetic hand.  Given that all fingers except for the thumb were affected on this hand, we aimed to design a specialized prosthesis comprising four fingers. Using 3D modeling technology, we created a prototype that closely mimicked natural finger movement and function. The patient underwent training sessions with our occupational therapist in order to learn how to control and manipulate her myoelectric prosthesis effectively.  For her left hand, which experienced amputations solely on specific metacarpals and proximal phalanges, we explored other options due to less extensive loss. After considering various factors such as personal preferences and functional requirements, it was determined that a body-powered prosthetic device would best suit this particular case.  A body-powered prosthesis is controlled through mechanical cables attached between individual finger components worn over intact digits or anchoring points elsewhere on an unaffected part of the body such as around the shoulder or elbow joint. These cables enable users like our patient with finger amputations or limb differences from congenital conditions or traumas regain some degree of grasp-and-release capability.  In consultation with our orthopedic technologist who specialized in creating custom-made orthoses for patients with upper limb differences, we proceeded with fabricating an orthotic solution tailored to the patient's unique needs. It was decided that a passive finger prosthesis, which replicates the appearance and basic functionality of missing fingers, would be most suitable for her case. This type of prosthesis does not involve any complex mechanical systems or motorized components.  With the orthotic solution in place, our occupational therapist provided extensive training sessions to ensure optimal usage and functionality of the body-powered prosthesis. The therapist also focused on establishing functional independence in daily activities such as grasping objects, writing, and self-care tasks using both prosthetic devices.  Throughout the rehabilitation process, we emphasized open communication with our patient to ensure that her expectations were met. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to address any issues or concerns she may have had while adjusting to using her prosthetic hands.  By customizing and incorporating cutting-edge technologies into our treatment plan, we were able to provide our patient with personalized solutions that greatly improved her dexterity and overall well-being. The successful integration of myoelectric and body-powered prostheses allowed her not only to regain lost hand functionalities but also enhanced confidence in social interactions through aesthetic restoration.  While there are ongoing advancements in prosthetic technology every day, it is important for patients with upper limb differences like this young woman to have access to comprehensive care from skilled professionals who understand their unique physical challenges. By utilizing interdisciplinary approaches like ours at our prosthetic office combined with continuous support from occupational therapists during the rehabilitation process, individuals can adapt more effectively and live fulfilling lives regardless of their physical limitations",continue
"The MDT carefully reviewed Mrs. A's case and discussed the potential risks and complications associated with her pregnancy. They considered the current condition of her mitral stenosis (MS) and the impact it could have on her cardiac function during pregnancy. It was vital to ensure that Mrs. A's heart can handle the increased blood volume and cardiac output demands that occur during this time.  After thorough evaluation, the MDT determined that a planned delivery via cesarean section would be optimal for Mrs. A to minimize stress on her cardiovascular system. This decision was made based on several factors including her severe MS, moderately dilated left atrium, and potential risks associated with instrumental deliveries or prolonged labor.  To prepare for surgery, Mrs. A was admitted for close monitoring of her cardiac function and placed under frequent observation by both obstetricians and cardiologists throughout her hospital stay. The anaesthetist conducted a detailed assessment of Mrs. A's airway management requirements considering possible difficulties due to maternal anatomy changes in late pregnancy.  During surgery, an experienced cardiothoracic surgeon with expertise in managing patients with structural heart diseases performed an aortic balloon valvuloplasty prior to cesarean section delivery to optimize hemodynamics during delivery.  Throughout the procedure, careful attention was paid to maintaining hemodynamic stability by administering fluids judiciously while avoiding fluid overload which could strain Mrs.A's already compromised heart function.  Postoperatively, close monitoring continued in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting where Mrs.A had regular check-ups of vital signs including blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), central venous pressure (CVP), invasive arterial pressures along with frequent 12-lead electrocardiograms to watch out for any arrhythmias related to anesthesia or post-operative complications such as bleeding or infection.  Pharmacological management played a crucial role in Mrs.A's recovery and long-term care. Medications like diuretics, vasodilators, and beta-blockers were prescribed to manage her heart failure symptoms effectively while preventing fluid retention.  As part of ongoing management in the post-operative period, Mrs. A received daily physiotherapy sessions to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). She was also educated on lifestyle modifications including a low-sodium diet, regular exercise regimen tailored to her cardiovascular limitations, and careful monitoring of her weight to detect any signs of fluid overload.  Planned follow-up visits were scheduled with both obstetricians and cardiologists for comprehensive post-operative cardiac rehabilitation programs specifically designed for pregnant women with heart conditions like Mrs.A. This personalized approach aimed at providing optimal care throughout pregnancy and beyond not only ensured the successful delivery of Mrs.A's baby but also minimized potential risks associated with her underlying cardiac condition.  The case of Mrs.A highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in managing complex medical conditions during pregnancy. By pooling together expertise from various specialties, a comprehensive assessment was conducted allowing for meticulous planning before, during, and after surgery resulting in a positive outcome for both mother and child despite challenging circumstances. Mrs. A recovered well in the postoperative period and was discharged with appropriate medications and a detailed follow-up plan. She continued to have regular check-ups and echocardiograms to monitor her cardiac function closely.  During subsequent visits, the MDT discussed the long-term management of Mrs. A's mitral stenosis. They explored the option of percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, a minimally invasive procedure that could potentially improve her symptoms and delay the need for surgical intervention.  The interventional cardiologist carefully evaluated Mrs. A's suitability for this procedure based on factors such as valve morphology, severity of stenosis, and associated comorbidities. Ultimately, it was decided that she was an ideal candidate for percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.  Mrs. A underwent the procedure under local anesthesia with moderate sedation in a cardiac catheterization laboratory equipped with advanced imaging technology. The interventional cardiologist successfully dilated her mitral valve using a balloon catheter, resulting in significant improvement in mitral valve area.  Following the procedure, Mrs.A experienced relief from her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue as her cardiac output improved significantly due to enhanced blood flow through her newly widened mitral valve.  In addition to ongoing medical management, Mrs.A enrolled in a structured cardiac rehabilitation program specifically designed for pregnant patients with heart conditions at an accredited healthcare facility near her home. The program included supervised exercise sessions tailored to her cardiovascular limitations along with educational sessions on healthy lifestyle habits during pregnancy.  Throughout the remainder of Mrs.A's pregnancy, she received regular antenatal care from obstetricians who closely monitored both fetal growth and maternal well-being. Any potential complications were promptly addressed by collaborating with the cardiology team to ensure optimal outcomes for both mother and baby.  As part of preterm labor planning considering preexisting risks due to maternal RHD history while expecting key impacted narrowing progress beyond adequate limits were aware as discussed and prepared under close communication of the obstetricians and cardiology team.  Eventually, Mrs.A delivered a healthy baby girl via planned cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation. The surgery was performed by the same team that had managed her throughout her pregnancy, ensuring continuity of care.  Following delivery, Mrs.A received appropriate postpartum care including pain management, wound care, and monitoring for signs of infection. Cardiologists closely evaluated her cardiac function to ensure there were no significant changes or complications related to labor and delivery.  Mrs.A's long-term management plan included regular follow-up visits with both cardiologists and obstetricians. The MDT continued to assess the need for further interventions such as mitral valve replacement or repair based on clinical indications.  The successful management of Mrs. A's pregnancy demonstrated the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in complex cases involving maternal cardiac conditions. By formulating a detailed plan and prioritizing close monitoring throughout pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period, adverse events were minimized while optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes.  This case highlights the significance of individualized patient care in high-risk pregnancies associated with heart disease. Every aspect from preconception counseling to meticulous planning for delivery is crucial in achieving favorable outcomes for both mother and child. Continuous collaboration between various specialties ensures comprehensive evaluation, prompt intervention when required while also providing emotional support to patients facing such challenges during their pregnancy journey.

"Upon arrival at Princess Marina Hospital, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. Vital signs were stable, and general examination showed no significant abnormalities. However, upon palpation of the abdomen, tenderness and fullness were noted in the right iliac fossa.  Laboratory investigations revealed a slightly elevated white blood cell count but were otherwise unremarkable. Further imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were ordered to better evaluate the nature and extent of the cystic mass.  The CT scan revealed a large cystic mass measuring approximately 12 cm in diameter with thick walls and multiple septations. It appeared to arise from the posterior aspect of the uterus, extending into the pelvis and displacing adjacent structures such as the bladder and sigmoid colon. The mass also had an intraluminal component that protruded into the lumen of both ascending colon segments.  Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of an ovarian cystic tumor with possible malignant transformation was made. The patient was then referred to gynecology for further evaluation and management.  In gynecology clinic, an extensive history was taken from the patient regarding her menstrual cycle pattern as well as any previous gynecological surgeries or interventions she had undergone. She reported regular menstrual cycles with no abnormal bleeding patterns or pelvic pain prior to two years ago when she first started experiencing symptoms.  A transvaginal ultrasound was performed by a specialist sonographer which confirmed findings consistent with ovarian primary origin for this mass rather than an adnexal one- either tuboovarian abscess or ectopic pregnancy-related pathology causing them; although they would still need surgical confirmation due potentially malignancy concerns given their size alone raised red chronicity-alarm responses requiring histopathological analysis including tumor marker levels if warranted it stayed reassuringly presscribing at this point purely beyond benign issues like dermoid however those tend not induce systemic inflammatory reactions such torsion ovarian cystic components can.  Given the patient's persistent pain, increasing size of the mass, and concern for possible malignancy, surgical intervention was recommended. The patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy with complete excision of the cystic mass and frozen section analysis during surgery to guide further management.  During the procedure, a large ovarian cystic tumor was found originating from the right ovary. The tumor measured approximately 15 cm in diameter and appeared to be confined within the ovary without infiltration into adjacent structures. No evidence of metastasis or spread to other organs was observed.  Complete excision of the tumor was performed successfully without any complications. Frozen section analysis showed no evidence of malignancy within the excised tissue specimen. Following surgery, routine postoperative care and monitoring were provided to ensure proper recovery.  Histopathological examination confirmed that the resected mass represented a benign ovarian mucinous cystadenoma, a type of epithelial tumor commonly found in women aged 40-60 years old. This diagnosis aligned with clinical suspicions based on radiological findings and intraoperative assessment.  The patient's postoperative course remained uneventful, with resolution of her previous symptoms including pain in the right iliac fossa. She underwent regular follow-up visits to assess her recovery progress as well as monitor for any signs of recurrence or complications related to her previous condition.  In conclusion, this case highlights a rare but clinically significant presentation of an ovarian mucinous cystadenoma causing chronic abdominal pain in a middle-aged woman. Timely referral and accurate imaging studies played crucial roles in establishing an appropriate diagnosis and guiding subsequent management decisions leading to successful surgical intervention and definitive treatment outcome for this particular patient.

"Upon examination, the patient appeared to be otherwise healthy and in good general condition. The swelling on her palate was about 2 cm in diameter, firm to touch, and had a smooth surface. There were no visible signs of inflammation or discoloration. The swelling was non-tender except when pressure was applied during swallowing.  The otorhinolaryngologist decided to perform further diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the swelling. A thorough examination of the oral cavity and surrounding structures was conducted, which revealed no abnormalities. The patient's tonsils appeared normal, with no signs of infection or enlargement.  An ultrasound scan of the swelling area was performed, which showed a well-defined solid mass beneath the mucosa of the palate. No evidence of cystic components or vascularity within the mass was observed.  Based on these findings, a biopsy was recommended to obtain tissue samples for pathological examination. The procedure was explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained. Local anesthesia was administered before obtaining two punch biopsies from different areas within the swelling.  Histopathological analysis revealed an encapsulated mass composed predominantly of glandular epithelial cells arranged in papillary projections with surrounding fibrous connective tissue stroma. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma (PA), one of most common benign salivary gland tumors.  The patient underwent further imaging tests including MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans and CT (computed tomography) scans to evaluate possible invasion into adjacent structures such as bones or sinuses that may require surgical intervention for complete removal if necessary.  After discussing all available treatment options with the patient, it was decided that surgical excision would be undertaken due to persistent symptoms and concern for potential growth over time if left untreated.  During surgery under general anesthesia, an incisional biopsy confirmed preoperative diagnosis showing characteristics consistent with pleomorphic adenoma without atypia seen on frozen section analysis at the time of surgery. Complete excision of the mass, along with a margin of surrounding normal tissue, was performed.  Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. Swelling and pain during swallowing gradually subsided within several days. The patient was discharged with specific postoperative instructions including maintaining good oral hygiene and avoiding strenuous physical activity for a few weeks to facilitate healing.  Follow-up visits were scheduled at regular intervals to monitor the patient's progress and evaluate for any signs of recurrence. At each follow-up appointment, clinical examination of the oral cavity was performed, including visual inspection and palpation of the surgical site.  Fortunately, there were no complications or evidence of local recurrence observed during these follow-up visits over a period of six months. The patient reported complete resolution of all initial symptoms and expressed satisfaction with the outcome of her treatment.  In conclusion, this case highlights an uncommon presentation but typical management approach for pleomorphic adenoma in an middle-aged unmarried female. Prompt evaluation by an otorhinolaryngologist with detailed history-taking, thorough examination, diagnostic tests such as ultrasound scan followed by biopsy is crucial in determining diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to each individual case.",continue
"Upon arrival at the hospital, Mrs E.V. was initially evaluated by the emergency department team. She presented with complaints of persistent abdominal pain, gradually increasing in intensity over the past few weeks. Additionally, she mentioned experiencing occasional episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath.  A thorough physical examination was conducted. Her vital signs were within normal limits, and her abdomen appeared distended with visible prominent vessels over the skin surface. The fetal heart rate was irregularly heard in different locations on auscultation.  An ultrasound scan was immediately arranged to determine the location and viability of the fetus. The scan revealed an intra-abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus estimated to be 34 weeks and 2 days gestation based on measurements taken during scanning.  Additional investigations included blood tests to assess her hemoglobin level, liver function status, renal profile, and coagulation parameters. These results would provide a comprehensive understanding of her general health condition and aid in planning appropriate management strategies.  Mrs E.V.'s husband was counseled about her condition by a healthcare provider trained in managing high-risk pregnancies. He expressed concern but remained supportive throughout this process.  Based on the findings from the ultrasound scan and laboratory investigations, a multidisciplinary team consisting of obstetricians, ultrasonographers, anesthetists, neonatologists and nurses convened for further evaluation of Mrs E.V.'s case.  After careful discussions amongst all team members regarding potential risks and benefits associated with various treatment options available for her unique situation; it was unanimously decided that she required surgical intervention promptly due to concerns about maternal wellbeing as well as potential risks for premature birth if left untreated longer than necessary given gestational age involved plus possible complications such as uterine rupture or hemorrhage related to placental abruption or thrombosis within exposed large vessels supplying circulation toward attached placenta at this late stage intensifying these circumstances even more greatly since traditional prenatal care hasn't been able determining presence symptoms or signs related to these comorbidities usual protocol womens attend.  Pre-operative interventions included offering blood transfusion and ensuring the availability of a well-stocked operating theatre with experienced personnel proficient in handling complex surgical procedures. Given the rarity of abdominal pregnancies, it was essential to be fully prepared for any unforeseen challenges that might arise intraoperatively.  The surgical approach chosen was a midline laparotomy due to anticipated difficulties in extraction of the fetus owing to its location within the abdomen. During the procedure, careful attention was paid to avoid injuring vital structures such as organs involved in digestion, kidneys and large blood vessels responsible for circulating oxygenated blood throughout body while simultaneously securing adequate exposure allowing proper visualization during operation minimizing potential risks arising secondary chance happenings such accidental bleeding heavy vessel close proximity normal skin opening hence complication management could be maximized avoiding unexpected detrimental outcomes adverse maternal-fetal effects event prolonged ischemia disturb organ perfusion strategy prioritizing timely revival affected tissue cells safeguarding health parameters fulfilling case specific exigencies best possible manner.

This case underscores the importance of comprehensive antenatal care that includes regular ultrasound scans and appropriate screening for potential risk factors or complications during pregnancy to prevent such critical situations from occurring.",continue
"However, her condition began to deteriorate rapidly, and she was transferred to a nearby tertiary hospital for further evaluation and management. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was pale, tachycardic, and complaining of worsening abdominal pain. The medical team quickly assessed her and suspected that she may have developed complications from the post-partum hemorrhage.  Investigations were promptly initiated to determine the cause of her deteriorating condition. Blood tests revealed a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating acute blood loss. An ultrasound scan of her abdomen displayed an enlarged uterus with retained products of conception. These findings confirmed the suspicion of retained placental tissue as the cause of her ongoing bleeding.  Given the severity of her condition and ongoing hemorrhage, an emergency surgical intervention was deemed necessary. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia.  During surgery, it became apparent that there were multiple fragments of retained placental tissue adherent to the uterine wall and surrounding structures. The surgical team meticulously removed all remaining tissues until thorough hemostasis was achieved.  Following surgery, the patient's vital signs stabilized gradually; however, she remained on close monitoring due to concerns about potential complications such as infection or secondary bleeding.  In addition to medical management aimed at preventing possible complications and promoting healing after surgery, a thorough examination was conducted by healthcare professionals involved in maternal care services. This included discussions regarding appropriate follow-up visits for postpartum women in order to ensure optimal care during this critical period.  Attention was also given towards addressing concerns regarding unconventional practices such as using ""herbs"" or other alternative methods for inducing labor without proper medical supervision or guidance. It is crucial for healthcare providers to educate pregnant women about safe labor induction practices while emphasizing regular antenatal care visits where potential risks can be identified early on.  In this case study, it is evident that lack of proper antenatal care, incomplete information, and the use of unregulated methods can have severe consequences for both the mother and baby. Consequently, this highlights the importance of comprehensive antenatal care that includes regular check-ups, appropriate screening tests, and provision of evidence-based information to ensure a healthy pregnancy and delivery.  Moreover, such cases underscore the significance of accessible healthcare services equipped with skilled personnel who can address complications promptly. In limited-resource settings where access to specialized facilities may be challenging, efficient referral systems are crucial to ensure timely management in cases requiring higher levels of care.  The lessons learned from this case contribute towards improving maternal healthcare practices by emphasizing the importance of regular antenatal visits, educating pregnant women about safe labor induction methods under medical supervision only, recognizing potential complications promptly, and ensuring timely transfer to appropriate care facilities when needed. By implementing these measures systematically across all healthcare settings globally, it is possible to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality rates significantly. In the weeks following the patient's surgery, she continued her recovery under close medical supervision. She was monitored for signs of infection, such as fever or abnormal discharge, and received appropriate antibiotics to prevent any further complications.  Additionally, she underwent extensive counseling on postpartum care and family planning. It was crucial to address not only her physical well-being but also her emotional health after experiencing a traumatic delivery and subsequent complications. The healthcare team provided support and resources for her to cope with any residual trauma or postpartum depression that may arise.  Furthermore, efforts were made to strengthen community outreach programs aimed at educating women about safe practices during pregnancy and childbirth.

"Upon arrival at the pediatric department, N.M.S appeared weak and febrile, with a temperature of 38.5°C. Her general condition was compromised, exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnutrition. The left forearm displayed prominent swelling and erythema, extending from the wrist to the elbow joint. The site of incision from the previous drainage still presented as an open wound with copious purulent discharge.  An immediate assessment was carried out by a multidisciplinary team including pediatricians, infectious disease specialists, and surgeons. Blood samples were taken for laboratory analysis, revealing elevated white blood cell count (20x10^9/L) along with a significant increase in C-reactive protein levels (52 mg/L). Radiographic imaging displayed extensive soft tissue swelling in the forearm associated with periosteal reaction and cortical thinning of adjacent bones.  Based on the clinical presentation combined with laboratory findings and radiographic evidence, osteomyelitis was suspected secondary to an initial septic focus within the soft tissues of N.M.S's left forearm.  The patient was started on empirical intravenous antibiotics including ceftriaxone and clindamycin to combat both gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus as well as potential gram-negative rods like Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.  Further investigations were performed to identify the causative microorganism involved in this complex infection. Tissue samples obtained during surgical debridement revealed abundant neutrophils without any granuloma formation. Additionally, culture results demonstrated growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirming its involvement in this deteriorating condition.  With confirmation of MRSA osteomyelitis in a young infant presenting with systemic symptoms alongside poor wound healing following initial drainage attempt; aggressive management became imperative promptly to prevent further complications such as abscess formation or septicemia.  Surgical intervention ensued with thorough debridement and irrigation of the wound site. Upon excision, adequate bone samples were taken for culture to ascertain sensitivities and guide targeted antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin was subsequently incorporated into the treatment regimen, tailored specifically to combat MRSA pathogens.  To ensure optimal recovery and wound healing, meticulous daily dressing changes were carried out using sterile techniques. Tissue debridement was performed at every dressing change to facilitate tissue regeneration. Pain management with oral analgesics such as acetaminophen was initiated.  During hospitalization, N.M.S required supportive care including intravenous fluids for hydration and nutritional supplementation via a nasogastric tube due to her compromised status.  Over the course of four weeks, N.M.S underwent repeated clinical assessments along with laboratory investigations including C-reactive protein levels and blood cultures to monitor treatment efficacy. Gradually, her inflammatory markers improved, demonstrating a significant decline in C-reactive protein levels (8 mg/L). Blood cultures remained negative after 7 days on appropriate antibiotics.  With evident signs of clinical improvement noted alongside resolution of systemic symptoms such as persistent fever and progressive regression in swelling; discharge planning commenced for N.M.S after 5 weeks of hospitalization under long-term oral antibiotics (clindamycin).  Ensuring meticulous follow-up appointments allowed close monitoring of her recovery process regarding wound healing while also assessing any recurrence or complications that might arise in the future.  N.M.S's case highlighted the importance of prompt recognition and early intervention when faced with suspected osteomyelitis in infants presenting with local swelling along with systemic symptoms. Collaboration among various medical specialties played a vital role in appropriate diagnosis establishment followed by aggressive antimicrobial therapy combined with surgical intervention resulting in favorable outcomes for this young infant patient.",continue
"Upon physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and in pain. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination was notable for confusion, right sided weakness (hemiparesis), and increased deep tendon reflexes in the right upper and lower limbs.  A preliminary diagnosis of a possible brain infection or tumor was considered due to the focal seizures and associated neurological deficits. Further investigations were required to ascertain the underlying cause of her symptoms. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities in complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, or electrolyte levels.  An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to evaluate her seizures. It revealed abnormal spikes and slow wave discharges predominantly over the left hemisphere, suggesting focal epilepsy originating from that area of the brain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain was also conducted which revealed a small lesion with surrounding edema involving the left parieto-occipital region.  At this point, an infectious etiology such as meningitis or encephalitis needed to be ruled out. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for further analysis. The results showed no evidence of bacterial infection but slightly elevated protein levels without any significant cells on cell count.  Considering her clinical presentation with headaches associated with photophobia and painful eyes preceding seizure activity along with imaging findings suggestive of a possible inflammatory process affecting one hemisphere of her brain, an autoimmune etiology was suspected as a probable cause.  Serum autoimmune markers including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs), and thyroid function tests were obtained; all came back within normal limits except ANA titer which was positive at 1:160 dilution.Neuroimmunology panel including encephalitis/encephalopathy autoantibodies was sent due to the suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis.  In the meantime, the patient's symptoms were managed with antiepileptic medication (levetiracetam) to control seizure activity. In consultation with a neurologist and rheumatologist, she was started on intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected autoimmune encephalitis. The patient showed gradual improvement with resolution of seizures and confusion within a few days of initiating treatment.  The neuroimmunology panel returned positive for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies, confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by prominent psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including seizures, memory deficits, movement disorders, and autonomic dysregulation. It predominantly affects young females and is often associated with underlying tumors like ovarian teratoma in 50% of cases; however, tumor screening in this case turned out negative.  The patient received a total course of five days of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by initiation of oral prednisolone tapered over several weeks alongside symptomatic management including levetiracetam. Follow-up assessments revealed ongoing improvement in her mental status along with resolving hemiparesis.  Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a rare but treatable cause of new-onset seizures or psychiatric symptoms in young individuals. Early recognition and prompt immunotherapy are crucial to prevent potential morbidity associated with this condition. As evident in this case report, clinical suspicion arising from characteristic features presenting as new-onset seizures preceded by flu-like prodromes should prompt further evaluation including testing for autoimmune markers such as ANA titers and neuroimmunology panels.  It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware that while infection may be initially considered due to nonspecific prodromes like headache and fever, autoimmune etiology should always be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis.",continue
"Upon examination, the woman appeared pale and tired, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg, and her heart rate was regular at 80 beats per minute. There were no abnormal findings upon auscultation of her lungs or heart.  Given her symptoms and medical history, further investigations were warranted. A complete blood count revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL), suggestive of a possible underlying cause for her fatigue and breathlessness. Her white cell count was within normal limits, ruling out any acute infection as the cause.  A chest X-ray was ordered to assess for any pulmonary pathology that could explain her symptoms. The X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in the lower lung fields consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). Given these findings, an echocardiogram was performed to evaluate cardiac function more comprehensively.  The echocardiogram revealed severe dilatation of both ventricles and reduced ejection fraction (EF) of less than 30%. These findings were indicative of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), likely related to long-standing HIV infection or its treatment. Right atrial thrombus was not evident on the echocardiogram.  To further elucidate the etiology behind her DCM, an HIV viral load test was conducted to assess the extent of viral replication despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). The test showed a detectable viral load at approximately 10,000 copies/mL – suggesting suboptimal control over HIV replication despite years on ART.  The patient's CD4+ T-cell count remained above 200 cells/mm3—indicating that she has not yet reached AIDS stage—but had progressively declined from previous measurements taken over several years. Additionally, routine liver function tests revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes that may be related to long-term ART use.  Considering these findings, a multidisciplinary approach was taken to manage the patient's multiple chronic conditions. The cardiology team initiated treatment for CHF with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers to alleviate symptoms and improve cardiac function. Strict adherence to ART was emphasized to optimize viral suppression and prevent further decline in immune function.  The patient was also referred to an infectious disease specialist for assessment of antiretroviral therapy regimen optimization. Given the suboptimal control over viral replication and possible drug resistance due to long-term use of Combivir and nevirapine, alternative options were considered. The specialist recommended switching the patient's current regimen due to ongoing concerns about potential side effects on cardiovascular health.  Educating the patient about lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise within her limitations, smoking cessation if applicable, and adherence to a heart-healthy diet was an integral part of managing her condition. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled with both the cardiology team and infectious disease specialist for continuous monitoring of her cardiac function and HIV management.  In conclusion, this case highlights the complexities that arise in managing individuals with multiple chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS, DCM, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of thrombus formation. A comprehensive approach involving different medical specialties is crucial for optimizing outcomes in such patients by addressing each condition individually while considering potential interactions between treatments. Continuous monitoring is essential in order to adapt therapeutics strategies based on evolving clinical presentations in individuals living with multiple chronic diseases alongside HIV/AIDS.

"On examination, the patient appeared to be in significant discomfort, with a visible swelling on the left side of his face. His oral hygiene was fair, and there were no obvious dental abnormalities except for an infected tooth in the upper left back region.  Upon further investigation, it became evident that the infection had spread from the tooth to affect the surrounding tissues. The patient had developed a dental abscess which was causing pain and pus discharge. This condition occurs when bacteria invade the dental pulp through a cavity or crack in the tooth, leading to an inflammatory response and subsequent accumulation of pus.  The numbness experienced by the patient on the left side of his face raised concerns about a potential complication of his dental infection called Trigeminal Neuralgia. This condition is characterized by sudden episodes of severe facial pain due to irritation or damage to one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. In this case, it seemed likely that infection-related inflammation was affecting one branch of this nerve, resulting in facial numbness.  To confirm these suspicions and evaluate for any other possible underlying causes for both symptoms, radiographic imaging was ordered. A panoramic X-ray provided valuable information about not only dental issues but also any potential involvement of nearby structures such as sinuses or maxillary nerves.  The X-ray revealed evidence of extensive decay and periapical pathology involving several teeth in proximity to where patients reported symptoms. It also showed signs of sinusitis due to spreading infection from compromised teeth roots into adjacent maxillary sinuses.  Based on these findings and clinical observations, a diagnosis was made - Chronic Apical Periodontitis with secondary Maxillary Sinusitis leading to Trigeminal Neuralgia-like symptoms.  Treatment options were discussed with utmost priority given towards managing pain control followed by definitive management plans for addressing both infected teeth and recurrent sinus infections relieving pressure off affected branches due indirect involvement by dental etiology that caused trigeminal neuralgia-like symptoms.  Initially, the patient was provided with appropriate antibiotics to manage the severe infection and alleviate inflammation. Additionally, analgesics were prescribed to reduce pain and discomfort.  To address the dental condition, a root canal therapy was suggested for all severely decayed teeth involved to eliminate the source of infection and restore oral health. Alternatively, extraction of affected teeth followed by prosthetic rehabilitation through partial dentures or dental implants could be considered in severe cases where restorative procedures were not feasible.  To manage recurrent sinus infections associated with compromised maxillary sinuses due to dental pathology, it was recommended for further evaluation by an ENT specialist who would assess sinus drainage pathways and recommend surgical intervention if needed.  Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor progress closely and ensure complete resolution of symptoms. The patient was also advised on the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene practices along with regular dental check-ups in order to prevent future complications such as recurrent infections or tooth decay.  In conclusion, this case presented a complex interplay between a chronic dental infection manifesting as Chronic Apical Periodontitis leading to Maxillary Sinusitis and subsequently causing trigeminal neuralgia-like symptoms. Through careful examination, appropriate investigations, and multidisciplinary approach involving oral medicine professionals as well as ENT specialists; significant relief from pain can be achieved alongside restoration of optimal oral health for such patients enabling them better quality of life moving forward.",continue
"The swelling seemed to be consistent with bilateral inguinal hernias. On palpation, the left-sided swelling was larger and appeared to contain a greater amount of fluid, while the right-sided swelling felt less prominent. The patient also reported occasional discomfort and heaviness in both groins.  Further examination revealed that the patient had no pain upon coughing or straining, which ruled out any possibility of an incarcerated hernia. Moreover, there were no signs of bowel obstruction or compromise on clinical examination.  To confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the hernias, a scrotal ultrasound was ordered. The results showed bilateral indirect inguinal hernias — left larger than right — with no evidence of testicular pathologies.  After discussing treatment options with the patient, it was decided to proceed with surgical repair of both inguinal hernias. As he didn't have any contraindications for anesthesia or surgery, a date for operation was scheduled.  On the day of surgery, preoperative preparations were made which included obtaining informed consent from the patient after explaining potential risks and benefits associated with surgical intervention. The procedure would involve reducing the contents of both hernial sacs back into their respective anatomical compartments along with reinforcing weak abdominal wall structures using either open or laparoscopic techniques.  Under general anesthesia, an infraumbilical incision was made and extended down towards each groin crease bilaterally. Careful dissection through subcutaneous tissue allowed exposure and identification of external oblique aponeurosis at each side separately.  For ease in access during herniorrhaphy procedure plan chosen here is Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach because it allows visualization intra-abdominally under direct control through dissection posterior to anterior rectus sheath till having peritoneum exposed however staged technique- do one side strengthening , close peritoneum then other side opens stay Indicated especially as the incidence of concurrent bilateral hernias is very high up to 25-30% patients and can cause potential harm during same surgery because of bowel injury and higher recurrence .  By going through the newly created defect in aponeurosis, hernial sac was exposed. Both indirect inguinal hernial sacs were gently dissected free from cord structures using blunt dissection. The necks of both sacs were then securely encircled using non-absorbable sutures to prevent future recurrence.  The remaining steps involved reduction of contents (omentum, fat) back into abdominal cavity followed by closure as per procedure details.  The surgical intervention was uneventful, with no intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthetic care unit for monitoring.  In the post-operative period, appropriate analgesics were given to manage pain adequately. The patient was advised bed rest for a few days followed by gradual resumption of daily activities under guidance. Regular follow-ups were planned to monitor wound healing, assess any potential complications or recurrence.  Follow-up visits over subsequent weeks showed that the patient had a successful recovery without any significant concerns or signs of relapse in either groin region.  In conclusion, this case highlights a common condition affecting males — bilateral inguinal hernias — which often presents with scrotal swelling and discomfort. Prompt diagnosis and early surgical intervention are crucial in alleviating symptoms and preventing complications such as bowel obstruction or strangulation. Timely medical attention ensures an optimal outcome for patients suffering from this condition.",continue
"The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical intervention to address the bilateral CSDH. After induction of anesthesia, a burr hole craniostomy procedure was performed on both sides of the skull. The intracranial pressure was relieved, and a drain tube was placed in each burr hole to facilitate cerebrospinal fluid drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Vital signs were stable, and there were no immediate complications from the surgery. Neurological examinations were conducted regularly to assess for any changes in motor function or consciousness.  Over time, the patient's headache gradually improved, and his limb activity disorder resolved completely. Serial cranial CT scans revealed a progressive decrease in size of the bilateral CSDHs. Drain tubes were removed when drainage decreased significantly.  During his hospital stay, antiepileptic medication was initiated due to concerns about seizure activity following brain surgery. Regular blood pressure monitoring and medication adjustments were made to ensure that hypertension remained under control.  As part of his overall care plan, physical therapy consultations were obtained to help improve muscle strength and mobility after prolonged bed rest. This involved exercises focusing on balance coordination and range of motion exercises for upper and lower limbs.  The patient's recovery progressed steadily over time without any notable complications or setbacks. He was eventually discharged from the hospital with scheduled follow-up appointments with both neurology and neurosurgery departments.  At his follow-up appointments over several months, neurological examinations showed no further abnormalities or deficits related to CSDH or surgical intervention. Cranial CT scans confirmed complete resolution of bilateral CSDHs without any evidence of recurrence.  The patient continued taking antihypertensive medication as prescribed by his primary care physician after discharge from our department as part of long-term management for systemic hypertension. He also adhered closely to recommendations regarding lifestyle modifications such as sodium restriction and regular exercise.  Given that he had a history of multiple lacunar infarctions, the patient was referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment to minimize the risk of recurrent strokes. This included optimizing his antithrombotic therapy and managing other vascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes.  In conclusion, this case highlights the successful management of a 71-year-old male patient with bilateral CSDH. Timely surgical intervention coupled with postoperative care including blood pressure control, seizure prophylaxis, physical therapy, and close monitoring resulted in complete resolution of symptoms and no evidence of recurrence. Collaboration between different specialties including neurosurgery, neurology, primary care physicians, and rehabilitation professionals was critical in ensuring optimal outcomes for this patient. Further research and studies have shown that chronic subdural hematomas are more prevalent in elderly individuals, often attributed to age-related brain atrophy and the presence of bridging veins that become more vulnerable to injury. It is essential to carefully assess the risk factors and medical history of patients presenting with symptoms such as headache and limb activity disorder, particularly in cases of minor head trauma or falls.  In this case, the patient's history of hypertension and lacunar infarctions added an additional layer of complexity to his condition. Hypertension has been associated with a higher risk of developing CSDH due to increased fragility of blood vessels within the brain. Managing hypertension effectively before surgery is crucial in reducing the risk of bleeding complications during the procedure.  Furthermore, lacunar infarctions can result from small vessel disease in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. It is imperative for these patients to receive comprehensive stroke prevention strategies involving antithrombotic therapy, lifestyle modifications, and aggressive management of vascular risk factors.  The successful outcome in this case also highlights the importance of preoperative coagulation parameter assessment. Excessive bleeding or clotting disorders can significantly impact surgical outcomes; therefore, monitoring these parameters before surgery ensures that appropriate precautions are taken.  During hospitalization, close postoperative monitoring plays a vital role in early detection and management should any complications arise. Neurological examinations are essential for assessing motor function or any signs indicative neurological decline post-surgery.  Additionally, antiepileptic medication was administered as prophylaxis against seizures after surgery. Seizures following brain surgeries are relatively common due to irritation caused by surgical manipulation or potential irritants from subdural hematomas themselves. Prophylactic treatment helps prevent unnecessary morbidity as a result of seizures while minimizing potential damage caused by uncontrolled electrical activity within the brain.  Physical therapy interventions are integral components of recovery following neurosurgery. Prolonged bed rest can result in muscle atrophy and reduced mobility. Physical therapy interventions aim to restore strength, enhance balance and coordination, and improve overall functional outcomes.  Effective long-term management for systemic diseases such as hypertension is crucial in preventing the recurrence of CSDHs or further complications. Patient education regarding medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up appointments contribute to actively managing these chronic conditions effectively.  In conclusion, the successful management of this 71-year-old male patient with bilateral CSDH emphasizes the significance of prompt diagnosis, timely surgical intervention, close postoperative monitoring, multidisciplinary care coordination involving various medical specialties. The collaboration between neurosurgery, neurology, primary care physicians, rehabilitation professionals ensures optimal outcomes for patients with complex medical histories. Further research is necessary to refine treatment strategies for CSDH in elderly individuals with comorbidities such as hypertension and lacunar infarctions.",continue
"Upon further examination, an intraoral periapical radiograph was taken, which showed extensive bone loss around the second premolar (45). Based on these findings, a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis with abscess formation was made.  Given the patient's medical history and complex condition, a multidisciplinary approach involving oral medicine, oral surgery, and endocrinology departments was planned to provide comprehensive care. The patient's diabetes mellitus and hypertension were well-controlled with appropriate medications. However, her gout required ongoing management.  The treatment plan consisted of several stages. First, the patient underwent scaling and root planing to remove plaque and calculus from the affected tooth surfaces. This was done under local anesthesia to ensure her comfort throughout the procedure. Adequate hemostasis was achieved following meticulous gingival curettage.  To manage both her periodontal disease and abscess formation effectively, adjunctive antibiotic therapy in conjunction with analgesics was prescribed for a week following the procedure. Special care was taken to select antibiotics that will not interfere with her existing medical conditions or medication regimen.  Following initial treatment, close monitoring of the patient's glycemic control was crucial to prevent any complications arising from her underlying diabetes mellitus during healing process.Timely follow-up appointments were scheduled for regular monitoring of blood glucose levels as well as assessment of clinical signs of healing such as reduced redness and swelling in the affected area.  Simultaneously, given that there is significant bone loss around tooth 45—an important factor contributing to its mobility—an orthodontic consultation emphasizing stabilization techniques such as splinting or occlusal adjustment may be considered depending on factors such as prognosis evaluation in terms of potential prosthodontic rehabilitation options available if necessary.It is essential to weigh risks versus benefits before proceeding due to her several co-morbidities that may complicate further intervention.  Furthermore,due consideration should be given for early referral for cardiovascular workup in relation to suspected cardiac involvement (ischemic heart disease) considering the right submandibular lymphadenopathy observed. It is paramount to exclude potential metastasis from other primary sites such as oral squamous cell carcinoma or systemic infections from remote foci.  Moreover, patient education was provided on maintaining proper oral hygiene practices and the importance of regular dental visits for long-term maintenance. Close collaboration with the patient's existing healthcare team allowed for effective interdisciplinary communication, ensuring comprehensive care and appropriate coordination of treatment plans.  In conclusion, this case presents a complex scenario involving a patient with multiple systemic conditions and localized dental pathology. Implementing a multidisciplinary approach facilitated comprehensive management that included both dental and medical considerations. By following systematic treatment protocols and close monitoring, it was possible to address the patient's immediate concerns while considering her long-term oral health needs.  Moving forward, regular follow-up appointments will be required to monitor her periodontal healing process as well as to evaluate her overall health status in relation to her chronic medical conditions. This case highlights the importance of collaboration among healthcare professionals when managing patients with complex medical histories who present with localized dental issues. Additionally, considerations must be made for the patient's gout and the potential impact on her oral health. Gout is a form of arthritis caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. While gout primarily affects the feet and ankles, it can also affect other joints, including those in the jaw.  It is important to assess if there is any joint involvement due to gout in this particular case. If present, appropriate management strategies should be implemented to mitigate any associated pain or discomfort. This may include pharmacological interventions such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or lifestyle modifications like dietary changes aimed at reducing purine intake.  Furthermore, consideration must also be given to the patient's ischemic heart disease and its potential implications for dental treatment. Ischemic heart disease refers to a reduced blood supply to the heart muscle due to narrowed coronary arteries. Any invasive dental procedure has the potential to induce transient bacteremia that may pose a risk for infective endocarditis in patients with underlying cardiac conditions.  Therefore, it would be prudent for this patient with ischemic heart disease and multiple co-morbidities including diabetes mellitus and hypertension to undergo preoperative cardiac evaluation before any invasive dental procedures are performed. This evaluation could include a thorough medical history review, assessment of functional capacity through exercise testing or stress echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), and consultation with a cardiologist if necessary.  Once these considerations have been addressed, prosthodontic rehabilitation options should be explored if tooth 45 cannot be saved due to its advanced mobility and extensive bone loss.Prosthodontics specialists can devise treatment plans that consider overall oral health as well as esthetic concerns along with ensuring stability of remaining dentition.  In cases where tooth extraction is necessary,a comprehensive discussion regarding restorative options should occur promptly after initial healing.Meticulous attention towards preservation of alveolar ridge contour following tooth extraction may be warranted to ensure favorable future prosthodontic outcomes if required. Close communication and coordination with the patient's medical team is essential throughout this process to ensure optimal outcomes.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach when managing patients with complex medical histories presenting with localized dental issues. By closely collaborating with specialists in oral medicine, oral surgery, endocrinology, and other relevant disciplines, it is possible to provide holistic care that addresses both dental and systemic health considerations. With careful planning and monitoring, it is possible to achieve favorable outcomes while minimizing potential risks for patients such as this 72-year-old female with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,gout,and ischemic heart disease.",continue
"Upon further evaluation, the patient reported occasional pelvic discomfort but denied any significant pain or other abnormal symptoms. She had regular menstrual cycles and a past medical history that was unremarkable, with no history of gynecological or autoimmune diseases. Physical examination revealed a mobile and non-tender abdomen with no palpable masses.  In order to assess the nature of the ovarian cyst and rule out any malignancy, further investigations were initiated. A repeat TVS confirmed an enlarged left ovarian cyst measuring approximately 6cm in diameter, with internal echoes suggestive of a complex structure. In addition to the increased size and complexity, there was evidence of vascularity on doppler imaging.  Given the patient's age and changes in cystic characteristics on imaging, it was crucial to consider both benign and malignant etiologies. The differential diagnosis included functional cysts like hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts or endometriomas, as well as neoplastic conditions such as mucinous or serous ovarian tumors.  To further evaluate these possibilities, additional tumor markers were requested including inhibin B and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The results came back within normal limits ruling out granulosa cell tumors or yolk sac tumors respectively. An MRI scan was also scheduled to better visualize the ovary's anatomy, characterize tissue composition accurately while assessing for signs of invasion into surrounding structures.  Following multidisciplinary discussion involving gynecologists specializing in oncology along with radiologists experienced in gynecological imaging; it was decided that surgical intervention would be necessary due to significant progression in size over a short period.  The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery for removal of her left ovarian mass ten days after her initial consultation at our institution. The frozen section analysis performed intraoperatively showed no malignancy; therefore only a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed without lymph node dissection considering its preserved fertility-based role involving conservative management where possible.  Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a benign serous cystadenoma- a common ovarian neoplasm derived from the surface epithelium. These tumors often don't cause any specific clinical presentations and may be incidentally discovered on routine imaging studies. Although they typically affect postmenopausal women, this case demonstrates that they can occur in perimenopausal patients as well.  The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with appropriate pain management medications, supportive care instructions, and follow-up plans to monitor for any potential complications or recurrent cyst formation. She was counseled regarding her bilateral ovarian function to ensure a thorough understanding of her future fertility prospects and offered consultation with reproductive endocrinologists if desired.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of regular surveillance in patients with known ovarian cysts. Although most benign cysts remain asymptomatic and stable in size over time, occasional cases may demonstrate enlargement or changes in their characteristics necessitating further investigation to rule out malignancy. Multidisciplinary approaches involving gynecological expertise coupled with radiological findings can help optimize patient management decisions while prioritizing fertility preservation where possible. Additionally, it is important to consider the limitations of tumor markers in the evaluation of ovarian cysts. While CA 125 and CA 19-9 are commonly used tumor markers for ovarian cancer, they can also be elevated in other benign gynecological conditions such as endometriosis or fibroids. Therefore, their levels alone cannot definitively diagnose or rule out malignancy.  The use of imaging modalities such as TVS and MRI is crucial in assessing the characteristics of ovarian cysts. Transvaginal ultrasound allows for a detailed examination of the pelvic organs and can provide information about the size, structure, vascularity, and potential presence of solid components within the cysts. It is considered a first-line imaging modality in evaluating ovarian masses.  In cases where there is suspicion for malignancy or unclear findings on ultrasound, MRI can provide more precise information about tissue composition and potentially aid in surgical planning. It enables better visualization of anatomical structures surrounding the ovary and assists in ruling out invasion into adjacent tissues.  The management approach for ovarian cysts depends on various factors including patient age, symptoms, size and characteristics of the cysts, presence or absence of malignancy markers or suspicious features on imaging studies.  For younger patients like our case who desire preservation of fertility if possible with no clear indication for immediate surgery (such as suspected malignancy), a conservative approach may be appropriate. Close follow-up with periodic imaging studies can help monitor any changes in cyst size or characteristics over time.  However, when there is significant progression in size or concerning features on imaging studies as seen in this case, surgical intervention becomes necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis and prevent potential complications such as torsion or rupture.  In conclusion, it is crucial to remain vigilant when managing patients with known ovarian cysts even if they have been stable over time. Regular surveillance through appropriate follow-up intervals helps detect any changes that may indicate malignant transformation. A multidisciplinary approach involving gynecology, radiology, and pathology expertise allows for accurate diagnosis and tailored management plans for each patient. By detecting and treating ovarian cysts promptly, we can ensure optimal outcomes for patients while providing the necessary support and information to make well-informed decisions about their fertility options.",continue
"The patient presented with severe lower back pain, which was localized to the lumbar region. The pain had gradually worsened over the past few weeks and was now interfering with his daily activities. Upon further evaluation, it was found that the patient also had limited range of motion in his lower back and tenderness upon palpation.  Given the patient's history of smoking and recent initiation of antituberculosis treatment, the possibility of drug-induced adverse effects leading to lumbar pain needed to be considered. It is well-known that certain medications used in tuberculosis treatment can cause musculoskeletal side effects, including joint and muscle pains.  A thorough examination revealed no signs of infection or inflammation in any other parts of the body. The laboratory results were within normal limits for routine blood tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers.  To confirm whether the current symptoms were related to drug-induced adverse effects or an underlying pathology, additional investigations were initiated. An X-ray of the lumbar spine showed no significant abnormalities except for degenerative changes consistent with age-related wear and tear.  MRI imaging was then performed to assess for any specific pathology such as disc herniation or spinal stenosis. The MRI revealed evidence of mild degenerative changes consistent with age but did not show any clear source for acute inflammation causing lumbar pain.  Considering all these findings together with temporal correlation between initiation of antituberculosis therapy and onset of symptoms, a diagnosis suggestive of drug-induced musculoskeletal side effect was made. It was decided to discontinue ethambutol (E) from the existing antituberculosis regimen while continuing Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z).  The patient underwent a trial period without ethambutol for 2 weeks while closely monitoring his symptoms. Within this time frame, there was a noticeable improvement in his lumbar pain along with improved functional mobility.  The patient was subsequently followed up for several months to ensure there was no recurrence of lumbar pain or any other adverse effects related to the remaining antituberculosis drugs. He remained pain-free and completed the full course of antituberculosis treatment without any further complications.  It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of potential side effects associated with antituberculosis therapy, especially in patients with pre-existing risk factors such as chronic smoking. Drug-induced musculoskeletal adverse effects can vary from mild joint pains to severe muscle inflammation and must be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients on TB treatment who present with new symptoms.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering drug-induced adverse effects in patients undergoing tuberculosis treatment who present with acute inflammatory lumbar pain. Prompt recognition, appropriate investigations, and timely adjustment or discontinuation of offending medications are vital in managing these side effects while ensuring successful completion of antituberculosis therapy. Close monitoring and follow-up should be conducted during treatment to identify any potential complications and ensure patient well-being.

"On examination, the patient appeared to be in good general health with no obvious signs of distress. Physical examination of the right hand revealed a slightly swollen and tender 5th finger. The range of motion was limited compared to the contralateral side, especially in flexion. There were no signs of erythema or warmth over the finger.  Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause of her symptoms. A radiographic evaluation was ordered, which revealed changes consistent with a recurrent enchondroma in the proximal phalanx of the 5th finger. The lesion appeared as a well-circumscribed lytic area with surrounding sclerosis.  Given that this was a recurrent enchondroma, surgical intervention was deemed necessary to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications. After obtaining informed consent, surgery was scheduled for en bloc resection of the enchondroma followed by reconstruction using autogenous bone grafting.  Under general anesthesia, a dorsal approach to the proximal phalanx was utilized. Careful dissection allowed for exposure and complete removal of the enchondroma without disruption to surrounding structures. The defect created after resection required stabilization using an autogenous bone graft harvested from her iliac crest.  The surgery proceeded without any major complications, and postoperative pain management included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with local analgesia at first request basis. The patient remained in observation overnight before being discharged home on oral analgesics.  Follow-up appointments were scheduled at regular intervals to monitor healing progression and assess functional outcomes. At each visit, radiographic imaging was performed to ensure proper consolidation of bone grafts and absence of any recurrence or complications.  In subsequent follow-up visits up to one year post-surgery, there were marked improvements in pain levels as well as restoration in range-of-motion that approached near-normal levels when compared with pre-operative status. Radiographic imaging also showed satisfactory incorporation of the bone graft with no signs of recurrence.  The patient was extremely satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and the subsequent rehabilitation. She reported significant improvement in daily activities, especially in tasks that required flexion of her 5th finger. The surgical intervention had successfully alleviated her pain and restored function to a great extent.  In conclusion, this case highlights a rare recurrence of enchondroma in the proximal phalanx of the 5th finger. Surgical resection followed by reconstruction using autogenous bone grafting proved to be an effective treatment option, resulting in pain relief and restoration of finger function. Regular follow-up monitoring is essential to ensure satisfactory healing and prevent any potential complications or recurrences. With appropriate treatment and management, patients can achieve successful outcomes even in cases where recurrence occurs after prior interventions for enchondromas. Enchondromas are benign bone tumors that arise from the cartilaginous cells within the bone marrow. They commonly affect the small bones of the hands and feet, and recurrence is rare after appropriate treatment. In this particular case, it is unclear why the patient experienced a recurrence despite previous successful treatment with curettage and back-filling with calcium phosphate cement (CPC).   The etiology of enchondromas remains largely unknown, but there are several theories including genetic factors, trauma, hormonal changes, and microenvironmental influences. It is possible that in this patient's case, there were underlying factors that predisposed her to a recurrence.  Although radiation therapy has been considered as an adjunctive treatment for recurrent or unresectable enchondromas in some cases, it was not indicated for this patient due to her excellent overall health status as well as absence of significant symptoms such as pathological fractures or neurovascular compromise.  Following the successful surgical intervention and rehabilitation, it is crucial to provide systematic long-term follow-up care for patients with enchondroma. This includes regular clinical examinations along with radiographic imaging to monitor any potential recurrences or complications.  Additionally, educating patients about self-assessment for concerning signs such as new onset pain or swelling should be emphasized so they can promptly seek medical attention if needed. The importance of maintaining good joint hygiene through appropriate exercises and activities modifications should also be stressed upon to minimize any potential limitations in hand function.  In conclusion, even though recurrent enchondromas are rare after initial successful treatment with curettage and back-filling with CPC; when they occur they necessitate surgical intervention followed by reconstruction using autogenous bone grafting. Adequate preoperative planning including thorough evaluation of medical history along with physical examination; utilization appropriate imaging studies such as X-rays is integral to ensure correct diagnosis and develop an effective surgical strategy tailored specifically towards each patient's individual needs.  Long-term follow-up care, including regular clinical evaluations and radiographic evaluations, is essential to monitor for any recurrences or complications. By providing comprehensive care and individualized treatment plans, patients can achieve favorable outcomes with improved pain relief and restoration of function.",continue
"A gummy smile, also known as excessive gingival display, is a condition in which an individual's gums are prominently visible when they smile. Although it does not pose any significant medical health risks, it can lead to aesthetic concerns and self-consciousness in individuals affected by the condition.  After thorough clinical examination and a review of the patient's medical history, it was determined that the 24-year-old man did not have any underlying medical conditions that could hinder surgical intervention. This was a positive indication for potential treatment options to address his excessive gingival display.  Upon observation of the patient's face, it was noted that his lips were incompetent or unable to fully cover his teeth when at rest. Intraorally, there appeared to be an adequate amount of attached gingiva present. The diagnosis of gummy smile was confirmed due to the noticeable 7-8 mm gingival display from maxillary right first molar to maxillary left first premolar while smiling. Notably, the proportions of his maxillary anterior teeth were deemed normal.  To address this cosmetic concern and enhance both functionality and aesthetics for the patient's oral cavity, a treatment plan was devised. While different treatment modalities could be considered depending on severity and associated factors specific to each case, one potential solution for this particular patient would involve surgical intervention.  The proposed surgical procedure involved crown lengthening through a technique known as osseous resective surgery. This method would entail removing excess gum tissue and bone surrounding certain teeth within the maxilla where excess gingiva is seen during smiling.  The advantages of utilizing this technique include ensuring optimal tooth proportions while minimizing post-operative complications such as root exposure or tooth sensitivity due to exposing too much tooth structure. Additionally, crown lengthening through osseous resective surgery would facilitate improved oral hygiene practices by creating easier access for efficient plaque control in areas previously concealed by excessive gum tissue.  Before proceeding with surgery, a comprehensive treatment plan was discussed with the patient. The discussion included detailing the procedure, expected outcomes, potential risks and complications, and post-operative care instructions. Informed consent was obtained before moving forward.  During surgery, local anesthesia was administered to ensure patient comfort. A series of precise incisions were made in the gingival tissue to access the underlying bone. The excess gingiva and bone were then carefully removed using a combination of hand instruments and rotary burs until ideal tooth proportions were achieved.  Following the surgical procedure, post-operative instructions were provided to facilitate proper healing. These included maintaining oral hygiene practices through gentle brushing using a soft-bristled toothbrush and avoiding hard or abrasive foods that could aggravate or damage the surgical site.  Periodic follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor healing progress and address any concerns or complications that may arise during recovery. Additionally, psychological support was offered to help alleviate any residual self-consciousness associated with the gummy smile prior to surgery.  In conclusion, excessive gingival display can be a source of aesthetic distress for individuals affected by a gummy smile. However, with advancements in oral surgery techniques such as osseous resective surgery for crown lengthening, there are effective treatments available to address this concern. By tailoring treatment plans specific to each case while considering individual factors such as severity and underlying bone structure, clinicians can provide satisfactory outcomes both functionally and aesthetically for patients seeking intervention for excessive gingival display during smiles.

"There was no palpable mass or rigidity, and the bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness on percussion over the left costovertebral angle.  Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, several differential diagnoses came to mind. The first possibility that needed to be ruled out was renal colic, which occurs when kidney stones block the urinary tract causing severe flank pain that radiates to the groin. However, the absence of hematuria made this diagnosis less likely.  Another potential diagnosis was acute pyelonephritis, an infection of the kidneys typically caused by bacteria ascending from the bladder. It is often associated with fever and flank pain but can present without significant urinary symptoms in older adults.  Other considerations included a urinary tract infection (UTI), which could present with lumbar pain and dysuria, as well as urolithiasis (normal urinalysis finding made this diagnosis less likely).  Laboratory investigations were ordered to further evaluate these possibilities. A complete blood count revealed a slightly elevated white blood cell count (11.8 x 10^9/L) with neutrophilic predominance. Renal function tests revealed mild elevation of serum creatinine (1.3 mg/dL) compared to his baseline value of 1 mg/dL.  A urine analysis showed pyuria (>10-15 leukocytes/hpf). Urine culture was sent for further evaluation of a possible UTI or pyelonephritis. Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein levels were also elevated at 34 mg/L.  Based on these findings, along with clinical suspicion for acute pyelonephritis given his history and examination findings, intravenous antibiotics were initiated promptly while awaiting urine culture results.  In addition to empiric antibiotic therapy targeting common pathogens such as Escherichia coli, anaerobic coverage should also be considered due to risk factors like diabetes mellitus or anatomical abnormalities. Fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins are often used as initial empirical therapy.  Further imaging studies were considered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying pathology contributing to the patient's symptoms. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, which showed inflammation in the left kidney consistent with acute pyelonephritis. No stones or obstructive lesions were identified.  Over the next few days, the patient's clinical condition improved significantly with antibiotic therapy. His lumbar pain subsided, and his urinary symptoms resolved. Repeat laboratory investigations demonstrated declining inflammatory markers and improvement in renal function.  Once culture results became available, tailored antibiotic therapy based on sensitivity testing was initiated to ensure effective eradication of the causative pathogen. The patient was continued on oral antibiotics for a total of 14 days in accordance with guidelines.  After completion of treatment, a follow-up visit was scheduled to monitor renal function as well as reassess blood pressure control given his history of hypertension.  In summary, this case highlights the importance of considering acute pyelonephritis as a potential diagnosis when an older adult presents with severe lumbar pain associated with urinary symptoms and signs of systemic infection. Prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial in managing this condition effectively and preventing complications such as renal abscess formation or sepsis.  Furthermore, it emphasizes that while COVID-19 has been dominating medical headlines globally, other common conditions such as urinary tract infections can still cause significant morbidity if left untreated. Thus, clinicians must maintain vigilance for alternate diagnoses during these challenging times to provide optimal care for their patients.",continue
"Upon further examination, it was revealed that Mr. X had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, which had been diagnosed 10 years prior. His treatment mainly consisted of dietary modifications and oral hypoglycemic agents, but there were several instances of poor glycemic control.  Considering his age and comorbidities, it was important to initiate a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. The chronic ulcerated wound on his left foot raised concerns about potential infection or peripheral vascular disease complicating his diabetes. Additionally, the development of a burgeoning wound accompanied by persistent bleeding indicated that the condition might have worsened over time.  Given Mr. X's unsuccessful treatment with cloxacillin, it was crucial to reassess the possibility of an infectious etiology and consider other differential diagnoses such as necrotizing fasciitis or cellulitis with abscess formation. It was decided to perform blood cultures and a deep tissue biopsy from the foot wound to identify any causative microorganisms and guide subsequent treatment.  Further investigations included comprehensive diabetic foot exams, vascular Doppler studies, HbA1c levels assessment for glycemic control monitoring, as well as renal function tests since long-standing diabetes can lead to kidney damage.  The results revealed elevated levels of HbA1c (indicating poor glycemic control), confirming diabetes-related complications in Mr. X's case. Vascular studies demonstrated diminished dorsalis pedis arterial pulses bilaterally along with mild peripheral artery disease (PAD). Moreover, both blood cultures and tissue biopsies showed growth of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  To address MRSA infection adequately while considering potential drug-drug interactions due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics or possible renal impairments related to long-standing diabetes, close consultation with an infectious disease specialist became indispensable.  The treatment plan focused on aggressive antimicrobial therapy tailored according to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic specifically effective against MRSA, was administered intravenously after taking into account the patient's renal function and weight.  In addition to antimicrobial therapy, wound care management and local infection control were crucial for healing Mr. X's ulcerated foot. A multidisciplinary team comprising nurses, podiatrists, and diabetes educators collaborated to provide meticulous wound care. The wound was regularly cleaned with sterile saline solution and dressed appropriately to maintain a moist environment conducive to healing while minimizing the risk of infection.  To improve glycemic control and prevent further complications related to his diabetes, Mr. X received intensified oral hypoglycemic agents in combination with dietary modifications under close monitoring by an endocrinologist.  Education played a vital role in managing Mr. X's condition effectively. He received guidance on diabetes self-care practices such as foot hygiene, regular self-examinations for any signs or symptoms of infections or ulcers, wearing appropriate footwear to alleviate pressure on affected areas, recognizing warning signs requiring immediate medical attention (e.g., increased pain or swelling), as well as proper administration of medications.  Throughout treatment and follow-up visits over several months, Mr.X demonstrated significant improvement in his symptoms with excellent glycemic control and wound healing apparent during subsequent evaluations.  The case of Mr. X emphasizes the complexity involved in managing diabetic foot complications in older individuals effectively. It highlights the significance of comprehensive assessments involving multiple disciplines collaborating closely for accurate diagnosis followed by individualized treatment plans tailored according to patients' unique needs and circumstances.

"The patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc) approximately 10 years ago. Systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorder that affects the skin and various internal organs. It can lead to widespread fibrosis and vascular abnormalities, causing significant morbidity and mortality.  Upon physical examination, the patient demonstrated limited mouth opening, measuring about 25 mm (normal range being 35-45 mm). The jaw movements were restricted due to pain and stiffness. Significant tenderness was noticed on palpation of the right and left pre-auricular regions. The muscles of mastication, particularly the masseter muscles, exhibited increased sensitivity upon pressure.  Further assessment involved a thorough examination of her temporomandibular joints (TMJ), which are responsible for jaw movement and chewing function. A clicking sound was elicited from the right TMJ when she opened her mouth wide. This finding suggested possible internal derangement within the joint.  To determine an appropriate treatment plan for this patient's orofacial pain and temporomandibular dysfunction, several diagnostic tests were performed. These included dental radiographs to assess for signs of degenerative changes or dislocation in the TMJ. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered to better visualize the joint structures in order to identify any structural abnormalities or inflammation.  The results of these diagnostic tests confirmed suspected findings related to SSc-induced orofacial pain symptoms. The dental radiographs indicated no significant pathological changes in relation to TMJ involvement; however, slight erosion was noted on one condylar head suggesting early osteoarthritic changes.  The MRI revealed bilateral synovial effusion within both TMJs with mild condylar deformities indicative of early temporomandibular joint arthritis associated with SSc involvement.  Considering all clinical findings along with imaging results associating masticatory muscle pain, joint sounds, and limited mouth opening, a diagnosis of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) secondary to systemic sclerosis was made.  Treatment options were then discussed with the patient. Due to the progressive nature of her condition and the presence of synovial effusion indicating inflammatory changes, conservative management techniques were initially employed. These included education about lifestyle modifications, oral habits re-education (e.g., avoiding excessive gum chewing), and jaw exercises for enhancing jaw mobility.  The patient was also referred to a rheumatology specialist to address the underlying autoimmune disorder contributing to her orofacial pain symptoms. Medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were prescribed by the rheumatologist in order to manage inflammation and slow down disease progression.  Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled at three-month intervals to monitor treatment progress, assess any further deterioration or need for escalation of treatment regimen.  In conclusion, this case highlights an example of temporomandibular dysfunction secondary to systemic sclerosis. Early recognition and appropriate interventions are crucial in managing these conditions effectively. Collaboration between dental professionals, rheumatologists, and healthcare providers from various disciplines is essential for optimal patient care in cases involving complex chronic diseases such as SSc-associated orofacial pain. The patient was also referred to an orofacial pain specialist for additional management of her symptoms. The orofacial pain specialist conducted a thorough examination of the patient's orofacial structures and determined that she exhibited signs of myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).  Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by the development of trigger points in the muscles, which can cause localized and referred pain. These trigger points can be a result of muscle overuse, stress, or trauma.  Considering this diagnosis, the treatment plan was adjusted accordingly. The patient was advised to undergo physical therapy sessions focusing on jaw exercises and relaxation techniques aimed at reducing muscle tension and improving mobility. In addition, trigger point injections were administered to directly target and alleviate the painful areas.  During her follow-up appointments, it became evident that the combination therapy approach had been beneficial for managing her symptoms. Her mouth opening gradually improved, reaching approximately 35 mm after several months of treatment. She reported experiencing less facial pain and masticatory difficulties compared to before.  However, it is important to note that managing temporomandibular dysfunction in patients with systemic sclerosis can be challenging due to their underlying autoimmune condition. Scleroderma-related involvement may persist despite adequate management of TMD symptoms.  In cases where conservative measures fail to provide sufficient relief or if there is evidence of disease progression, more invasive interventions such as arthrocentesis or arthroscopy may need to be considered.  Arthrocentesis involves flushing out the joint space with sterile fluids while arthroscopy allows for direct visualization and intervention within the joint using specialized instruments. These procedures aim at relieving joint inflammation and improving overall function by removing any adhesions or pathological tissues present within the TMJ.  Before pursuing these more invasive options, further collaboration between healthcare providers involved in her care would be necessary to ensure optimal decision-making regarding potential risks versus benefits based on her individual circumstances.  It is worth emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing orofacial pain and temporomandibular dysfunction associated with underlying systemic conditions such as systemic sclerosis. This approach ensures that the patient receives comprehensive care that addresses both their autoimmune condition and its specific manifestations in the orofacial region.  Regular follow-up appointments should be continued to monitor disease progression, adjust treatment plans as necessary, and provide ongoing support for symptom management. Additionally, patient education regarding self-care strategies can empower individuals to take an active role in their own oral health.  Ultimately, through integrated teamwork and individualized care, patients with systemic sclerosis-related orofacial pain can achieve improved quality of life while effectively managing their symptoms.",continue
"Upon examination, the neonate appeared distress and was crying inconsolably. The mother reported no history of any previous injury or trauma to the child. There were no obvious signs of external bleeding or swelling, except for the extensive loss of tissue on the left side of the face.  The immediate concern was to stabilize the patient and control any potential sources of bleeding. Dressings were applied to prevent infection and maintain moisture at the site of tissue loss, especially around the eyes and nares. The patient's vital signs were monitored closely, including oxygen saturation levels.  Due to the complex nature of these injuries, a multidisciplinary team was immediately involved in assessing and managing this case. Plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, pediatricians, and nurses worked together to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for this fragile newborn.  Initial investigations were carried out to exclude any underlying medical conditions that could have contributed to this presentation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities in clotting factors or biochemical markers indicative of systemic disease.  Considering that there were no eye witnesses present during the incident, various differential diagnoses had to be considered in order to determine possible causes for these unusual injuries. Non-accidental trauma (NAT) or child abuse was amongst them but appeared unlikely considering there had been no prior incidents reported by family members or healthcare professionals involved with routine check-ups.  With careful scrutiny and detailed discussions with family members about their daily activities leading up to this incident, attention focused on environmental factors that may have played a role in causing such injuries. It became apparent that while breastfeeding approximately 30 minutes before discovering her injured child's condition, an older sibling had placed her inside a zip-up net placed on a bed about 60cm from the floor after wrapping her in a shawl.  Further evaluation revealed significant damage caused by pressure necrosis due to prolonged entrapment within an inflexible material like a zip-up net combined with positional forces exerted during breastfeeding interaction within an unmonitored setting. The zip-up net had created pressure points on delicate facial structures, resulting in tissue ischemia and subsequent necrosis.  The parents were devastated upon learning the possible cause of their newborn's injuries, as they had intended to ensure safety by using the net to prevent accidental falls from the bed. However, they were unaware of the potential harm it could cause if not used properly.  Upon explanation and counseling regarding this unfortunate incident and alternative measures for ensuring infant safety, parents felt guilt-ridden yet relieved to have an explanation that did not involve abuse or neglect. The importance of safe sleep practices and appropriate monitoring during breastfeeding was emphasized to both parents.  Following careful consideration by a multidisciplinary team, surgical interventions were planned in stages to provide optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes for the affected areas of the neonate's face. Tissue expansion techniques were utilized along with grafting procedures to restore lost eyelid structures and reconstruct nasal integrity.  Over time, with counseling, support groups, and regular follow-up visits from healthcare professionals experienced in pediatric trauma care, both parents began recovering from their emotional distress associated with this unfortunate incident. They advocated for increased awareness about potential risks associated with misuse or improper use of baby products through local parenting networks.  This case serves as a reminder for healthcare professionals of all disciplines about the importance of providing comprehensive education regarding infant safety practices. While neonatal facial injuries may be rare occurrences associated with unusual circumstances such as this one described here, it is crucial to always consider environmental factors when confronted with puzzling presentations in pediatric patients.  Education campaigns targeting new parents should focus on providing information about recommended safe sleep practices (including avoiding elevated surfaces), monitoring infants during breastfeeding sessions, and proper usage guidelines for baby products such as nets or carriers meant to prevent accidental falls or injury. It is our hope that raising awareness can prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future while promoting a culture that prioritizes child welfare above all else.",continue
"Further investigations were carried out to determine the nature and extent of the testis tumor. Blood tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and tumor markers were within normal limits.  A decision was made to proceed with a left inguinal orchiectomy to remove the testicular mass. The surgery was successful, and histopathological examination of the excised tissue confirmed the presence of a germ cell tumor - specifically a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT).  Based on this diagnosis, further staging workup was performed to assess if there was any spread of cancer beyond the testis. A chest X-ray revealed no evidence of metastasis in the lungs. However, given the presence of abdominal mesenteric lymph nodes noted on imaging earlier, it was decided to perform a surgical exploration with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) for both therapeutic and staging purposes.  During RPLND surgery, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found in close proximity to major blood vessels in the retroperitoneum. These lymph nodes along with some adjacent tissues were meticulously dissected and sent for histopathology analysis.  The pathology report indicated that several lymph nodes from different regions tested positive for malignancy consistent with NSGCT metastasis. Following these findings and considering all available information such as type and extent of disease involvement based on imaging results, it was concluded that adjuvant chemotherapy would be necessary.  The patient received systemic chemotherapy using a combination regimen consisting of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). This therapy is considered standard treatment for patients presenting with advanced NSGCT.  Throughout his treatment course lasting several cycles over months following surgery; clinical assessments including regular physical examinations along with laboratory investigations such as blood counts were conducted periodically to monitor his response to therapy as well as potential side effects associated with chemotherapy.  Fortunately for our patient at each assessment, he demonstrated a favorable response to chemotherapy with resolution of metastatic lesions in the lymph nodes based on imaging studies. Moreover, tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) also returned to normal levels indicating tumor regression.  Following chemotherapy completion, the patient remained under close surveillance with regular follow-up visits and imaging studies such as CT scans performed at predetermined intervals to monitor for any signs of recurrence. Given his advanced age and potential long-term consequences of therapy, it was crucial to strike a balance between ongoing monitoring and minimizing undue interventions.  Over subsequent years during follow-up appointments, our patient continued to show no evidence of disease recurrence or progression. Careful review of serially obtained images consistently demonstrated no new lesions or abnormalities.  The successful treatment outcome in this case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis, appropriate staging investigations, multidisciplinary treatment planning involving surgical and medical oncology expertise in testicular cancer management. Additionally, it emphasizes the significance of ongoing surveillance after completion of therapy for prompt detection and intervention if needed.  This case also serves as a reminder that testicular enlargement should not be ignored or attributed solely to aging. Any persistent mass in the scrotum warrants evaluation by a healthcare professional since early diagnosis leads to more favorable outcomes in testicular cancer cases.",continue
"Mrs MNO, a 61-year-old retired teacher, was referred to our unit for better management of a leiomyosarcoma. The diagnosis was made in a secondary hospital through an endometrial biopsy (curettage) performed due to painless mild per vaginal bleeding that had been evolving for one year.  Taking a detailed medical history, we discovered that Mrs MNO had her first menses at the age of 14. She has been menopausal for the past nine years and has not engaged in sexual intercourse for the past fifteen years. There is no history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and she has never undergone a pap smear cervical cytology. Furthermore, there is no personal history of gynecological malignancies.  Upon further investigation, we found that leiomyosarcomas are rare malignant tumors arising from smooth muscle cells within the uterus. Although their occurrence is rare overall, they tend to affect women during their reproductive years or after menopause as in Mrs MNO's case.  Additionally, it is important to note that per vaginal bleeding after menopause should raise concern and prompt further evaluation as it can be an indication of serious underlying conditions such as endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.  Given Mrs MNO's age and presenting symptoms, it was crucial to ensure proper management and intervention without delay. We initiated several diagnostic procedures including pelvic ultrasound imaging which revealed an enlarged uterus with irregular thickening of the endometrium.  To confirm the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma and stage its extent accurately, additional investigations were performed. These included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans along with chest X-ray examination which showed no evidence of metastasis or involvement beyond the confines of the uterus.  Considering various treatment options available for uterine leiomyosarcoma at different stages including surgery (hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy), radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof, we discussed the potential benefits and risks with Mrs MNO in detail.  Due to the presence of localized disease confined to the uterus, surgical intervention was deemed appropriate as the primary treatment modality. The procedure was performed successfully, removing the affected uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Histopathology analysis confirmed leiomyosarcoma without lymphovascular invasion or involvement of adjacent structures.  Post-surgery evaluation revealed that Mrs MNO's recovery process was satisfactory with no immediate complications or evidence of metastasis. She received appropriate postsurgical care including pain management and follow-up appointments for monitoring her overall health condition.  Considering her age and menopausal status prior to diagnosis, hormonal therapy was not recommended as it is typically reserved for women who are still premenopausal. Instead, a multidisciplinary approach involving regular follow-up visits along with periodic imaging (MRI scans) were scheduled every three months to closely monitor any signs of recurrence or metastasis.  In conclusion, Mrs MNO's case demonstrates the importance of thorough investigation and prompt action when presented with concerning symptoms such as painless per vaginal bleeding after menopause. Timely referral allowed us to diagnose and manage her leiomyosarcoma appropriately through effective surgical intervention followed by structured surveillance measures tailored specifically for her unique circumstances. Continued close monitoring will ensure any potential recurrence or metastatic spread is promptly detected and addressed in order to provide optimal long-term care for Mrs MNO's overall well-being.",continue
"ARVD, or Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia, is a rare inherited heart disease that primarily affects the right ventricle of the heart. It is characterized by the progressive replacement of healthy heart muscle with fibrous and fatty tissue, leading to enlargement and dysfunction of the affected ventricle.  In this particular case, the patient's initial symptoms were palpitations associated with ventricular arrhythmias. This prompted further investigation into the cause of these arrhythmias, which eventually led to a diagnosis of ARVD. The diagnostic criteria included right ventricular dilation and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 45%. Additionally, frequent premature ventricular complexes were observed during stress testing and late potentials were detected in an electrocardiogram with high amplification.  Given the patient's personal history of type II diabetes and dyslipidemia treated with diet alone, as well as their family history of atrial fibrillation in their mother, it is crucial to evaluate any possible links between these conditions and ARVD. While there is yet no established connection between diabetes or dyslipidemia and ARVD specifically, it is important to consider them as potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease in general.  The management plan for this patient involves multiple aspects including medical therapy, lifestyle modifications, genetic counseling/testing for family members at risk, implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and regular follow-up evaluations by an expert cardiac electrophysiologist.  Medical therapy typically includes antiarrhythmic drugs such as beta-blockers or sodium channel blockers to suppress abnormal electrical signals originating from the diseased region. These medications aim to reduce arrhythmic episodes as well as control heart rate during exercise or stress situations.  Lifestyle modifications are equally important in managing ARVD. Patients are advised against engaging in vigorous physical activity that may place excessive strain on their hearts. Instead, low-impact exercises like swimming or cycling are recommended, under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol, and managing diabetes effectively are crucial to preventing further progression of the disease.  Genetic counseling/testing is strongly advised due to ARVD's inheritable nature. Family members at risk should undergo genetic testing to identify potential carriers or affected individuals. This allows for early detection and implementation of appropriate management strategies.  Implantation of an ICD is essential for patients who have experienced life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or are at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to severe ARVD. The ICD constantly monitors heart rhythms and delivers electrical shocks whenever dangerous arrhythmias are detected, effectively restoring normal heart rhythm.  Regular follow-up evaluations by a cardiac electrophysiologist ensure proper monitoring of the disease's progression and adjustment of treatment strategies if necessary. These evaluations may include echocardiograms, stress tests, Holter monitoring (where patients wear portable electrocardiogram devices), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to assess cardiac structure and function.  In conclusion, this case highlights the diagnosis and management approach for a patient with ARVD who presented with palpitations related to ventricular arrhythmia. Timely diagnosis is essential in order to implement appropriate management strategies aimed at reducing symptoms, preventing complications such as heart failure or sudden cardiac death, as well as offering genetic counseling/testing for family members at risk. A comprehensive multidisciplinary team comprising cardiologists specializing in electrophysiology along with other healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in effectively managing this complex condition.",continue
"Leigh syndrome, also known as Leigh's disease, is a rare inherited neurological disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the brain and leads to a wide range of symptoms including developmental delays, muscle weakness, movement disorders, and respiratory problems.  In the case of our patient, the onset of symptoms began at an early age. The loss of walking ability at age 5 was a significant milestone in his decline. This progressive loss of motor function resulted in severe difficulties in speech and movement, hampering his ability to perform daily activities independently.  To alleviate some of the extra pyramidal symptoms caused by Leigh syndrome such as dystonia and rotatory nystagmus, our patient has been prescribed L-Dopa medication. L-Dopa is typically used to treat Parkinson's disease but can also be effective in managing some motor symptoms associated with other movement disorders.  Despite being on medication, our patient's condition has significantly impacted his life. The combination of physical limitations and cognitive impairments led him to discontinue his education at the secondary level. This has been a source of frustration for him and has further contributed to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.  The diagnosis of Leigh syndrome was made based on various clinical findings. The presence of both axial (affecting the trunk) and peripheral (affecting limbs) extra pyramidal syndrome along with dystonic movements supported this diagnosis. Additionally, radiological investigations using cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed signal abnormalities in the central gray nucleus - another characteristic feature seen in Leigh syndrome cases.  Biographical indices also played a role in confirming this diagnosis. The patient's family history was significant as two sisters had died during infancy due to complications related to Leigh syndrome. This genetic link strongly pointed towards an inherited form of the disorder within their consanguineous marriage.  Managing patients with Leigh syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach involving various healthcare professionals. Physiotherapists can help with maintaining and improving mobility through exercises and assistive devices. Speech therapists play a crucial role in improving communication skills, while occupational therapists focus on enhancing daily living activities and independence.  In addition to symptomatic treatment, genetic counseling is often recommended for families with Leigh syndrome cases. Understanding the inheritance pattern and the risk of recurrence can help individuals make informed decisions about family planning.  It is important to note that there is currently no cure for Leigh syndrome. Treatment mainly focuses on supportive care and symptom management to improve quality of life for affected individuals. Research into potential therapies is ongoing, including gene therapy approaches that aim to correct the underlying genetic mutations responsible for the disorder.  In conclusion, the case of our 20-year-old patient with Leigh syndrome highlights the devastating impact this rare neurological disorder can have on an individual's life. It emphasizes the need for early detection, comprehensive care, and ongoing support for both patients and their families in managing this complex condition. Despite the challenges our patient faces, it is important to provide him with a holistic approach to care that focuses on addressing not only his physical and cognitive limitations but also his emotional well-being. Mental health support, such as counseling or therapy, can help him cope with the psychological impact of living with a chronic condition and assist in building resilience.  Assistive technology can also play a significant role in improving our patient's quality of life. Devices such as mobility aids, communication tools, and adaptive equipment can enhance his independence and enable him to engage more actively in various activities.  Moreover, social integration is crucial for individuals with Leigh syndrome. Encouraging participation in community events, support groups, or disability-friendly programs can provide opportunities for socialization and interaction with others facing similar challenges. This sense of belongingness can alleviate feelings of isolation and foster a sense of community.  Regular monitoring of our patient's health status is vital to ensure that any changes or complications are identified early on. Regular check-ups, regular blood tests, and other relevant investigations will help assess the progression of the disease and guide treatment adjustments accordingly.  Genetic research into Leigh syndrome continues to advance our understanding of this complex disorder. Identifying specific genetic mutations associated with Leigh syndrome subtypes may open doors for targeted therapies in the future. Clinical trials evaluating potential treatments are ongoing and offer hope for improved outcomes in affected individuals.

"The patient's medical history reveals some concerning factors that contribute to her current condition. The pathologic contractions and maternal edema with albuminuria during pregnancy indicate the presence of gestational complications, which could have potentially affected fetal development. Despite a normal delivery, anomalies became apparent during the neonatal period.  The initial manifestations observed in the neonatal period include dolichocephalism (abnormal elongation of the head), hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of both the liver and spleen), amaurosis (partial or complete blindness), osteosclerotic bone changes discernible on X-ray, and hematologic aberrations. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of osteopetrosis was made.  Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective bone resorption, leading to increased bone density and susceptibility to fractures. This condition typically arises from abnormalities in osteoclasts, cells responsible for breaking down old bone tissue so that new bone can form properly. As a consequence of this impairment, patients often exhibit dense bones with reduced marrow spaces.  Upon diagnosis of osteopetrosis in this patient at such an early age, corticosteroid therapy was initiated as part of her treatment plan. Corticosteroids possess anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly prescribed in diverse medical scenarios; therefore we can assume they were used here either to alleviate specific symptoms or slow down disease progression.  However, despite ongoing treatment with corticosteroids, additional complications arose later on. In November 2008, the patient developed right mandible edema requiring surgical intervention due to suspected osteomyelitis – an infection involving the jawbone.  Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition usually caused by bacteria entering through open wounds or spreading from nearby infections via blood circulation. It can lead to severe pain and swelling around the affected area as well as systemic symptoms like fever or chills if left untreated.  Given the patient's history of osteopetrosis and previous manifestations such as hepatosplenomegaly, it is plausible that her compromised immune system made her more susceptible to infections, including osteomyelitis. The surgical treatment likely involved debridement (removal of infected tissue) and administration of antimicrobial agents to control the infection.  Managing a case like this requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists in genetics, orthopedics, ophthalmology, and infectious diseases. Ongoing assessment of bone density progression, regular monitoring for infections or complications related to osteopetrosis, and prompt intervention when necessary are essential for optimized patient outcomes.  Educating the family about the condition and potential complications is crucial as well. Genetic counseling may be recommended to explain inheritance patterns and assist with informed family planning decisions. Additionally, psychosocial support should be provided to help the patient cope with any disabilities resulting from osteopetrosis or its associated complications.  In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the challenges posed by osteopetrosis in a young girl's life. The pathologic contractions during pregnancy raised early concerns about her well-being which were confirmed by various anomalies detected soon after birth. Timely diagnosis allowed for the initiation of corticosteroid therapy but subsequent development of mandible edema necessitated surgical intervention due to suspected osteomyelitis. Continued monitoring and interdisciplinary management will be vital in addressing present difficulties while minimizing long-term consequences associated with this rare genetic disorder.",continue
"On examination, the patient appeared anxious and mildly uncomfortable. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed no remarkable findings. On digital rectal examination, the prostate was slightly enlarged but non-tender.  In order to determine the cause of his condition, several investigations were carried out. A urinalysis did not show any abnormalities or presence of red or white blood cells. The initial complete blood count revealed normal hemoglobin and white blood cell count.  A transrectal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the prostate and surrounding structures for any abnormalities that might contribute to the symptoms. The ultrasound showed an enlarged prostate with areas of calcification but no evidence of any abnormal masses or lesions in other structures.  Given these findings, a prostatic biopsy was performed under local anesthesia to further investigate the possibility of prostate cancer or any other pathological conditions contributing to bloody ejaculate. The biopsy results showed benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with chronic inflammation consistent with chronic bacterial prostatitis.  Although BPH is mostly associated with lower urinary tract symptoms such as hesitancy, weak urinary stream, and frequent urination, it can rarely present with hematospermia (bloody ejaculate). This condition occurs due to congestion and an increased vascularity within the prostate gland as a result of enlargement.  Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by recurrent urinary tract infections caused by bacteria that have colonized the prostate gland. It often presents as recurrent episodes of dysuria, pelvic pain or discomfort without systemic signs such as fever or chills.  The patient was started on oral antibiotics targeting common pathogens implicated in chronic bacterial prostatitis such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis based on local antibiotic resistance patterns. He was also advised to follow-up regularly for blood pressure monitoring and management since uncontrolled hypertension could contribute to worsening BPH symptoms.  At a 2-week follow-up visit, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms. He had no further episodes of bloody ejaculate, and his urinary symptoms had also improved. Repeat urinalysis showed no abnormalities.  The association between hematospermia and prostate cancer is rare but still warrants investigation, particularly in older patients or those with risk factors. However, the absence of abnormal masses or lesions on imaging studies and benign biopsy results provided reassurance in this case.  In conclusion, hematospermia is an alarming symptom that often causes anxiety for patients and prompts medical consultation. While it can be associated with serious conditions such as prostate cancer or infections, non-malignant causes such as BPH should also be considered.  Timely evaluation and appropriate investigations are necessary to identify the underlying cause accurately. Management should be tailored towards treating any identified pathology while providing reassurance to alleviate patient concerns. Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor response to treatment and ensure proper management of comorbidities such as hypertension in order to optimize overall health outcomes for patients presenting with hematospermia. Furthermore, educating patients about the potential causes and reassuring them about the generally benign nature of hematospermia is essential in order to alleviate their anxiety.  In addition to BPH and chronic bacterial prostatitis, there are other possible causes of hematospermia that should be considered. These include sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, urethral strictures, prostate or bladder infections, and even rare conditions like cystic lesions or tumors within the genitourinary system. Therefore, a thorough history including sexual practices and previous exposure to STIs should be obtained to guide further investigations.  If there are any suspicions of an underlying infection or STI, appropriate tests such as urine culture or specific tests for STIs can be ordered. In cases where there is persistently recurrent bleeding without a clear cause identified on initial evaluation, further imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to visualize the prostate gland and surrounding structures in more detail.  It's worth noting that most cases of hematospermia resolve spontaneously without intervention within a few weeks or months. However, if symptoms persist or worsen over time or if additional concerning symptoms develop such as blood in the urine (hematuria), difficulty urinating (urinary retention), pelvic pain, weight loss or bone pain; further evaluation by a urologist may be warranted.  The management of hematospermia depends on its underlying cause. In cases where an infection is confirmed, appropriate antibiotic therapy targeting the responsible pathogen(s) should be initiated. For non-infectious causes like BPH-related hemospermia with no bothersome urinary symptoms requiring treatment; conservative management with reassurance and observation may suffice.  For patients with persistent bleeding despite conservative measures or those with significant physical discomfort related to their condition; surgical intervention such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be considered after careful discussion of the risks and benefits.  In conclusion, the case described highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation in patients presenting with hematospermia. While it can be linked to serious underlying conditions, including prostate cancer, benign causes like BPH and chronic bacterial prostatitis should also be considered. A stepped approach involving history-taking, physical examination, imaging studies, and targeted investigations is essential for accurate diagnosis. Prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and regular follow-up are crucial to ensure optimal outcomes in these patients while addressing their concerns and providing reassurance throughout the process.",continue
"During the surgical procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia to ensure she remained unconscious and pain-free throughout. The surgeon made an incision along the jawline to gain access to the fractured mandible. Intra-operative pictures were taken, which revealed excellent access to the fracture fragments.  The surgeon carefully reduced and aligned the fractured fragments using specialized instruments. Comminuted fractures can be challenging due to multiple fragment segments, but with sufficient access, the surgeon was able to successfully reduce them.  To stabilize the fracture and promote proper healing, three miniplates were placed strategically along the jawline. Miniplates are small metal plates that are screwed into place to hold the fractured bones in position while they heal. They provide stability and support for bone repair.  In this case, intra-operative pictures showed that adequate reduction had been achieved, and miniplates were securely fastened in place.  Post-surgery care involved close monitoring of wound healing and infection control. Given that this patient initially presented with an infected wound at admission, it was crucial to address any infection concerns post-operatively as well. Antibiotics were prescribed accordingly to prevent further infection or complications.  To aid in recovery, a soft diet was recommended for several weeks after surgery while allowing time for bone healing and minimal strain on the repaired area. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for regular check-ups and assessments of progress.  Additionally, depending on individual circumstances such as dental alignment or occlusion issues resulting from mandible fractures near symphysis region injuries (as seen in this case), further dental interventions may be necessary later on.  Overall outcomes depend on factors such as age, overall health condition before injury presentation at hospital along with adherence post-surgery instructions by patients etc., but when properly managed like in this case with early intervention choosing appropriate surgical technique considering factors like infected wounds including comprehensive care; patients can typically expect a successful recovery with restored functionality of their jawline over time.  It is worth noting that this case highlights the importance of careful surgical planning, patient assessment, and suitable treatment selection based on individual circumstances. In cases of comminuted fractures with infected wounds where closed reduction is not feasible, open reduction with miniplate fixation can provide a successful outcome.  The utilization of intra-operative pictures assists in evaluating the success of the surgical procedure and ensuring accurate alignment and stabilization of fractured fragments. These images also serve as documentation for future reference in the patient's medical records.  In conclusion, this case presented a 28-year-old female patient with comminuted mandible fractures on one side along with a fracture at the symphysis region resulting from a fall. The infection in her wound required open reduction treatment rather than closed reduction. With precise surgical intervention under general anesthesia, excellent access to the fracture fragments was achieved, allowing for proper reduction and placement of three miniplates for stabilization. Successful management post-surgery included close monitoring of wound healing and infection control while following appropriate dietary recommendations. Overall outcomes are expected to be positive with restored functionality over time through comprehensive care and adherence to post-operative instructions by the patient.",continue
"The patient reported experiencing pain in the right mandibular region for two weeks. She also mentioned difficulty in opening her mouth fully and discomfort while chewing. The continuous nature of the pain and the presence of a palpable submandibular lymph node raised concerns about a possible underlying pathology.  Upon further examination, it was observed that the patient had poor oral hygiene, with plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation evident throughout her mouth. In relation to the second premolar (45), a distinct lesion characterized by gingival bleeding, ulcerated raised edges, and class 3 mobility was noted.  Given the patient's medical history, it was important to consider any potential systemic involvement or complications related to her pre-existing conditions. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is known to significantly impact wound healing and increase susceptibility to infections. Hypertension can affect vascular health, while ischemic heart disease may pose challenges during treatment procedures due to potential cardiovascular risks.  To determine the cause of the pain and discomfort in this case, additional investigations were deemed necessary. A combination of imaging techniques such as panoramic radiography or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) could provide valuable information about bone density, tooth root integrity, and potential odontogenic infections affecting adjacent structures.  Furthermore, an incisional biopsy from the lesion site would be essential for accurate diagnosis. A biopsy would allow histopathological examination by a pathologist who could identify any cellular abnormalities or signs of malignancy if present.  Considering both age-related factors as well as comorbidities associated with this specific case prompted cautious decision-making when formulating a treatment plan. Collaborative efforts between oral medicine specialists and oral surgeons at SAHLOUL Hospital ensured comprehensive evaluation of all aspects involved in managing this complex situation.  Pending biopsy results indicating either benign or malignant pathology within the lesion site would greatly influence subsequent steps taken in planning appropriate treatment modalities. Benign lesions might require localized therapies like scaling and root planing, as well as necessary periodontal procedures to promote oral health and comfort.  However, if the biopsy revealed malignancy or suspected malignancy, prompt referral to an oncologist would be essential. In such cases, further imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be required to assess potential metastatic spread. Treatment options for malignant lesions could entail a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or targeted therapies tailored to the patient's overall health status and prognosis.  As part of the management plan regardless of the biopsy results, emphasis on improving oral hygiene through proper education and motivation was crucial. Implementing strict plaque control measures and regular follow-up visits would aid in preventing further complications related to her existing medical conditions.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluation in patients with complex medical histories presenting with symptoms such as pain and discomfort in oral regions. The need for collaboration between different specialties within healthcare institutions cannot be understated when formulating appropriate treatment plans tailored to each patient's individual needs while considering their specific comorbidities. To ensure the best possible outcome for the patient, close communication and coordination between the oral medicine and oral surgery department and other healthcare providers involved in her care were essential. This included consulting with her primary care physician, endocrinologist, cardiologist, and any other specialists as needed to optimize her overall health before proceeding with any invasive procedures.  Taking into consideration her insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, careful monitoring of blood glucose levels before and after treatment was imperative to prevent any potential complications. Ensuring adequate glycemic control would contribute to better wound healing and decrease the risk of post-operative infections.  In addition, close attention was given to managing her hypertension during dental procedures. Appropriate measures such as stress reduction techniques, avoiding vasoconstrictors in anesthetics when possible, and constant blood pressure monitoring played a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular stability throughout treatment.  Furthermore, precautions were taken regarding potential drug interactions with the patient's current medications. It was important to review her medical history thoroughly before prescribing any additional medications or adjusting existing ones.  The patient's age also required special considerations to ensure a comfortable experience during treatment. Adequate pain management protocols were established to minimize post-operative discomfort while taking into account any contraindications related to the patient's medical conditions or medication regimen.  Once all necessary investigations were completed and biopsy results confirmed a diagnosis of either benign or malignant pathology within the lesion site, appropriate treatment options could be discussed with the patient. In cases of odontogenic infection or localized pathologies such as gingivitis or periodontal disease necessitating intervention on tooth 45 specifically, targeted therapies like scaling and root planning would be performed under strict aseptic conditions.  If malignancy was identified within the lesion site or suspected based on biopsy results indicating malignant features such as cellular atypia or invasion beyond basement membrane integrity oncologic referral for further workup would be made urgently by involving multidisciplinary teams including oral surgeons head-neck surgeons medical oncologists and radiation oncologists.  Throughout the entire treatment process, supportive care and patient education were emphasized. The patient's understanding of the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene, managing her diabetes and hypertension, as well as the potential implications of her medical conditions on oral health was crucial for long-term success.  Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor overall oral health, glycemic control, blood pressure management, and any potential complications or recurrence. Ensuring ongoing collaboration between healthcare providers involved in her care allowed for coordinated efforts in providing optimal patient-centered treatment.  In conclusion, this case illustrates the complex nature of managing a patient with a history of multiple comorbidities presenting with pain and discomfort in the oral region. A multidisciplinary approach involving coordination between different specialties within healthcare institutions is essential to ensure comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment planning tailored to each patient's specific needs. By addressing both systemic factors along with localized oral conditions, the goal is to achieve improved overall health outcomes while maximizing comfort and quality of life for the individual patient.",continue
"Upon examination, the patient appeared visibly uncomfortable and had a limited range of motion in his knees due to pain. His abdominal enlargement was apparent, with the right side significantly larger than the left. The skin overlying the enlarged area was stretched and had a red-purple appearance.  In order to determine the cause of his symptoms, further investigations were required. Laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes, but other organ functions were within normal limits. Imaging studies such as ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan were performed to assess the extent of abdominal enlargement and evaluate any possible underlying pathology.  The CT scan revealed a large lipoma located in the right lower abdomen extending from below the ribs to just above the pelvis. A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fat cells that can develop anywhere in the body where fat tissue exists. In this case, it seemed to be responsible for both his abdominal enlargement as well as his mechanical symptoms such as difficulty lying down or walking without support.  A multidisciplinary team comprising a general surgeon and anesthesiologist developed a treatment plan for this patient. Due to its size and location, surgical intervention was deemed necessary to alleviate his symptoms and improve overall quality of life.  The patient underwent an elective surgical procedure called liposuction-assisted debulking under general anesthesia. The aim was not complete removal but rather reduction in size to help alleviate symptoms caused by mechanical compression on surrounding structures such as nerves and blood vessels.  During surgery, several liters of fatty tissue were aspirated from the lipoma using specialized cannulas connected to suction devices. The surgeon also carefully preserved important surrounding structures during removal process, ensuring minimal damage or trauma.  Postoperatively, there was an immediate relief of pressure symptoms experienced by this patient after debulking procedure. He could lie down comfortably without any discomfort or requirement for support aids like walking sticks while walking decreased significantly due improved mobility following surgery.  Histopathology confirmed that it was indeed a lipoma, and the patient was advised regular follow-up to monitor for any recurrence or complications.  While lipomas are generally harmless and tend to grow slowly, they can cause discomfort and restrict daily activities if they become large enough. In this case, the abdominal enlargement had progressed over 15 years, leading to significant impairment in quality of life.  It is important for individuals to seek medical attention if they notice any unusual growths or changes in their body, especially if these growths are associated with persistent symptoms. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can help prevent complications and alleviate discomfort caused by conditions such as a lipoma.  Ultimately, surgical intervention in this case resulted in an improved quality of life for the elderly patient who had been struggling with mobility issues for several years. The reduction in size of the lipoma relieved mechanical compression on surrounding structures, allowing him to resume normal activities without pain or difficulty. The patient was advised to make some lifestyle modifications to maintain his overall health and well-being. This included regular exercise, a healthy diet, and weight management strategies to prevent any further complications or the development of additional lipomas in the future.  Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled with his healthcare team to monitor for any signs of recurrence or new symptoms. The surgical site was monitored for proper healing, and the patient was educated on how to identify any concerning changes or potential complications that may arise.  Emotionally, the patient experienced a significant improvement in his mental well-being as he no longer had to deal with chronic pain and limitations on daily activities. He reported feeling a renewed sense of freedom and independence, which also positively impacted his relationships with family and friends.  This case highlights the importance of considering uncommon causes when evaluating patients with atypical symptoms. While abdominal enlargement may initially be dismissed as weight gain or aging-related changes, it is crucial for physicians to be vigilant in identifying underlying pathologies that could be causing these symptoms.  In conclusion, this 75-year-old man's 15-year history of asymmetrical abdominal enlargement turned out to be caused by a large lipoma. His presenting symptoms including difficulty lying down, knee pain, dragging weight tilt, and occasional waist pain were all attributed to mechanical compression from the lipoma. Surgical intervention through liposuction-assisted debulking provided significant relief from his symptoms and improved his quality of life. Regular monitoring will continue to ensure long-term success without any recurrences or complications.  It is essential for individuals experiencing unusual growths or persistent symptoms like those described here seek medical evaluation promptly rather than dismissing them as normal signs of aging or weight gain. Early intervention can lead to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans contributing positively towards overall health outcomes. ",continue
"The young barber, named Ravi, was shaken up after the road traffic accident that left his right upper extremity injured. He was thankful that he hadn't sustained any head trauma and was conscious and oriented throughout the ordeal. Ravi was swiftly taken to Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital (AVBRH) in Sawangi Meghe for immediate medical attention.  Once at the hospital, Ravi was examined by an orthopedic surgeon who specialized in treating upper extremity injuries. The surgeon requested various investigations to fully understand the extent of Ravi's injury: X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies.  The X-ray images revealed no fractures or bone involvement, easing some of Ravi's concerns about potential long-term disabilities. However, the MRI scan showed significant damage to his radial nerve on the right side—specifically classified as axonotmesis according to Sunderland's classification system (Grade 3). This meant that while his nerve fibers had been severely damaged, there remained a possibility for regeneration.  To stabilize Ravi's wrist and hand during this critical healing period, a static cock-up splint was applied. This would help prevent further aggravation of the injured area and allow it to heal properly without unnecessary movement or strain. Alongside this treatment plan, analgesic medications were prescribed primarily to manage pain resulting from both trauma and inflammation caused by the injury.  Ravi received detailed instructions from both the orthopedic surgeon and nursing staff on how to take care of himself at home during his recovery period. Emphasizing rest as a key aspect of healing, they advised him not to put excessive pressure or weight on his injured hand and arm while performing daily activities.  The medical team also suggested that Ravi engage in regular physiotherapy sessions once sufficient healing had taken place—an essential step towards restoring full functionality of his affected limbs through exercises aimed at strengthening the surrounding muscles and promoting nerve regeneration.  To closely monitor Ravi's progress, a follow-up appointment was scheduled for 15 days later. During this visit, the orthopedic surgeon intended to assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan so far and make any necessary adjustments based on Ravi's recovery trajectory.  During his time at home, Ravi dealt with various emotional and physical challenges. As a barber, his livelihood depended on both hands being fully functional. The prospect of weeks or even months without being able to work normally worried him deeply. However, with support from his family and friends, he found solace in knowing that he had sought medical attention promptly and was in good hands at AVBRH.  Relying on their reassurances and determined to regain full use of his injured hand as soon as possible, Ravi committed himself wholeheartedly to adhering to the prescribed treatment plan during this crucial healing period. He eagerly anticipated his upcoming follow-up appointment as an opportunity for progress evaluation and potential adjustments in therapy that would bring him closer to resuming normal professional life once again. As the days passed, Ravi diligently followed the instructions given to him by the medical professionals. He wore the static cock-up splint consistently, ensuring that his wrist and hand remained stable. The analgesic medications provided him with some relief from the pain associated with his injury, allowing him to focus on his recovery.  Throughout this time, Ravi was grateful for the support of his family and friends who encouraged and motivated him during moments of doubt or frustration. They helped with household chores and offered words of encouragement when he felt discouraged about not being able to work.  After what felt like an eternity, Ravi finally reached the day of his follow-up appointment. Nervously but optimistically, he made his way back to AVBRH where he would find out how much progress he had made in healing.  Upon meeting with the orthopedic surgeon again, Ravi was relieved to hear that there were signs of improvement in his condition. The swelling had reduced significantly around his injured extremity, indicating that inflammation was subsiding. Additionally, slight improvements were noted in nerve conduction velocities during follow-up nerve conduction velocity studies compared to previous readings.  Encouraged by these positive developments on physical examination and test results, a modified rehabilitation plan was suggested for Ravi's continued healing journey. Physiotherapy sessions were scheduled for two times a week instead of waiting for complete resolution of swelling before initiating rehabilitative exercises.  The physiotherapist guided Ravi through a series of exercises aimed at retraining and strengthening the muscles around his affected limb while promoting nerve regeneration. These exercises included range-of-motion exercises to improve flexibility as well as resistance training using therapeutic bands or weights carefully selected based on Ravi's ability at each stage of recovery.  Ravi learned how to perform these exercises correctly under close supervision at first before incorporating them into a daily home exercise routine recommended by the therapist. Adhering strictly to this regimen would help him regain strength, coordination, and ultimately achieve a full recovery of his right upper extremity.  Slowly but surely, Ravi noticed improvements in his hand and wrist mobility. His grip strength increased gradually over time. Although he still experienced occasional discomfort during certain movements or activities, he remained optimistic and focused on achieving his ultimate goal—returning to work as a barber.  With each passing week, Ravi's determination grew stronger. He continued attending physiotherapy sessions diligently, giving the exercises his all. The support of the medical team at AVBRH and the unwavering encouragement from loved ones motivated him through even the toughest moments.  Months later, after rigorous rehabilitation efforts and consistent follow-up visits to AVBRH’s orthopedic clinic, Ravi finally reached a milestone in his recovery. He was given approval by the orthopedic surgeon to gradually return to work as a barber with certain modifications initially for limited hours until he regained full confidence in performing all tasks without any hindrance.  Overjoyed by this news, Ravi resumed his profession with caution but enthusiasm. With time and perseverance combined with ongoing rehabilitation exercises to refine motor skills lost during recovery phase gradually resolved completely allowing him to fully return to normal occupational life as if no injury had occurred.  Ravi’s journey showcased not only the importance of timely medical attention but also highlighted the potential for individuals like him to overcome physical adversity through sheer determination supported by proper healthcare intervention coupled with strong emotional pillars from family members and friends providing vital encouragement along the way.  As he continued working diligently at restoring function in his injured extremity day by day after such an unfortunate accident earlier in life that seemed impossible;  it was evident that Ravi's resilience served as an inspiration not just for himself but for others facing similar challenges on their road to recovery.",continue
"On examination, the index patient appeared lethargic and had a fever of 38.5°C. There were no signs of respiratory distress or dehydration. Neurological examination revealed decreased muscle strength in the right upper limb and both lower limbs, with a power grade of 2/5. Muscle tone was flaccid, and deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally.  The patient's speech was severely slurred, making it difficult to understand him. There was also noticeable mouth deviation to the left side when he attempted to speak or smile.  Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of these symptoms. Blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count (14,000 cells/mm^3), indicating an inflammatory response in the body. Other laboratory parameters such as liver function tests, renal function tests, electrolyte panel, and blood glucose levels were within normal limits.  Brain imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to assess for any structural abnormalities or lesions in the brain. The scans revealed multiple areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images involving bilateral frontal lobes and left parietal lobe.  Based on these findings, a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was considered in this case. ADEM is a demyelinating disorder that typically follows an infectious or post-infectious event such as a viral infection or vaccination.  Prompt management was initiated to alleviate symptoms and prevent further neurological deterioration. The patient received intravenous corticosteroids along with supportive care including physical therapy for maintaining muscle strength and speech therapy for addressing his aphasia.  Over time, significant improvements were observed in the index patient's clinical condition. His slurred speech gradually improved into coherent conversation without any difficulty expressing himself verbally or understanding others' speech properly.  Muscle weakness also improved gradually through physical therapy sessions that focused on strengthening exercises for his limbs. Within a few weeks, the patient regained his ability to walk independently without any support.  Follow-up neuroimaging studies were conducted to assess the resolution of brain lesions. A repeat MRI showed marked improvement, with partial resolution of previously identified hyperintense areas.  After several weeks of close monitoring and rehabilitation, the index patient was discharged from the hospital. He continued to attend outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy sessions to further enhance his motor skills and speech fluency.  Long-term prognosis for patients with ADEM varies depending on the extent of neurological involvement during the acute phase and response to treatment. Some patients may experience residual neurological deficits or relapses in their condition, while others may fully recover without any long-term complications.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and management of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in pediatric patients presenting with neurological symptoms such as progressive slurred speech, limb weakness, and mouth deviation. Early intervention in terms of immunomodulatory therapies like corticosteroids along with supportive care can lead to significant improvement in symptoms and overall outcomes for these patients. Regular follow-up visits are vital to monitor the patient's progress and ensure the effectiveness of ongoing therapies. During these visits, the healthcare team assesses the patient's neurological status, conducts physical examinations, and evaluates any potential relapses or complications.  In addition to medical treatments, emotional and psychological support is also crucial for both the index patient and their family. Coping with a neurological disorder can be challenging for children and their loved ones, so counseling services may be offered to help them navigate through this difficult time.  Furthermore, it is imperative to identify any underlying triggers that may have contributed to the development of ADEM in order to prevent future episodes. In this case, a thorough review of the patient's medical history was conducted in search of potential infections or vaccinations that could have triggered an immune response leading to ADEM. Educating patients and their families about preventive measures regarding infections or vaccinations may reduce the risk of recurrence.  Research on ADEM is ongoing as scientists seek a deeper understanding of its causes, mechanisms, and optimal management strategies. This will aid in refining diagnostic criteria and improving treatment protocols for better outcomes.  It is worth noting that while ADEM primarily affects children, it can also occur in adults although less frequently. The precise incidence rate remains unknown due to variations across different populations but estimates suggest it affects approximately 0.4-0.8 per 100,000 individuals per year.  Cases like the index patient emphasize the significance of careful evaluation in pediatric patients presenting with relevant symptoms. Prompt diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment significantly contributes not only to symptom resolution but also reduces long-term complications associated with ADEM.  As research continues into demyelinating disorders like ADEM, advancements in diagnostic techniques such as neuroimaging will likely lead to more accurate identification of brain lesions associated with these conditions as well as better prognostic tools for healthcare providers moving forward.  In summary, recognizing early signs and symptoms along with prompt management is crucial in cases of ADEM. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, pediatricians, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care to patients.  Through further research and continued advancements in medical treatments, the prognosis for individuals with ADEM is expected to improve. Increased awareness among healthcare providers will aid in early identification and timely management of this condition. With appropriate intervention and ongoing support, patients like the index patient can regain function and experience improved quality of life.",continue
"Upon admission to the ICU, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. He appeared severely dyspneic and was in respiratory distress. His heart rate was elevated at 110 beats per minute, and his blood pressure was within normal limits.  Further investigations were conducted to determine the underlying cause of the patient's acute respiratory failure. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation in both lungs. These findings were suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane.  To assess lung function more precisely, a pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed. The results showed severely impaired lung volumes with reduced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was also significantly reduced, indicating impaired gas exchange at the level of the alveoli.  Based on these findings, a diagnosis of ARDS secondary to heavy smoking-induced lung damage was made. The patient's history of being a 10 pack-years smoker suggested chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an underlying condition contributing to his current illness.  The management plan for this patient primarily focused on providing high-flow oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation mask to improve oxygenation while minimizing intubation risks. In addition, bronchodilator medications such as short-acting beta-agonists were administered to relieve bronchospasm and alleviate airway obstruction caused by COPD.  Due to persistent hypoxemia despite maximal medical therapy, it became necessary for the patient to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Lung-protective ventilation strategies were employed using low tidal volumes and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels to prevent further lung injury associated with ventilator-induced trauma. The care team closely monitored the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters, including arterial blood gases, to optimize ventilatory support.  In an effort to manage the underlying etiology of ARDS, systemic corticosteroids were initiated to reduce lung inflammation. However, it should be noted that the use of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial and must be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition.  Throughout his ICU stay, the patient received aggressive pulmonary rehabilitation measures, including physiotherapy exercises and mobilization techniques to prevent complications related to immobility. Multidisciplinary consultations involving respiratory therapists, nurses specialized in critical care medicine, and pulmonologists were conducted regularly to ensure comprehensive care.  Despite intensive management efforts, the patient's clinical course was complicated by developing a secondary infection requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, he experienced episodes of hemodynamic instability necessitating vasopressor therapy.  After several weeks of meticulous medical management and supportive care in the ICU setting, there was gradual improvement in his overall respiratory function. Serial chest X-rays revealed resolution of alveolar opacities with gradual re-expansion of collapsed lung regions.  Eventually deemed stable enough for transfer out of ICU into a general ward for continued recovery and weaning from mechanical ventilation support. The patient was advised on smoking cessation strategies and offered guidance for long-term respiratory rehabilitation programs aimed at optimizing lung function.  In conclusion, this case highlights the complexity involved in managing acute respiratory failure resulting from extensive smoking-related damage leading to ARDS in a young adult. It underscores the importance of early recognition and timely intervention with appropriate ventilatory support strategies along with treating underlying causes such as smoking-induced COPD. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative throughout all stages of treatment to optimize outcomes for these patients. ",continue
"Further examination revealed that the patient's blood pressure was significantly elevated at 160/100 mmHg. Her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her respiratory rate was normal at 18 breaths per minute. The patient appeared uncomfortable and complained of a severe headache that had been ongoing for several hours. She described her vision as blurry, particularly in her right eye.  Upon assessing the patient's medical history, it was discovered that she had a previous uncomplicated pregnancy with no apparent issues or complications. However, this time around, she had developed hypertension during the third trimester along with associated symptoms of preeclampsia.  Preeclampsia is a condition that affects pregnant women and is characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organ systems, most commonly the liver and kidneys. It usually occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and can be potentially life-threatening if left untreated.  Given the severity of her symptoms and concerns about potential complications related to preeclampsia, immediate intervention measures were taken to stabilize both the mother and fetus. The patient was admitted to the obstetric ward for further monitoring and management.  Initial treatment involved strict blood pressure control using antihypertensive medications deemed safe for use during pregnancy. Monitoring of fetal well-being through regular ultrasound examinations was initiated to assess growth parameters such as fetal weight, amniotic fluid index, Doppler studies of umbilical artery waveforms, etc.  Laboratory investigations were also carried out on admission to identify any underlying conditions or possible exacerbating factors leading to preeclampsia development in this otherwise healthy individual. Urine analysis showed proteinuria (protein levels higher than normal), which further confirmed the diagnosis of preeclampsia.  Further evaluation included complete blood count tests along with liver function tests (LFTs) and renal function tests (RFTs) which all came back within acceptable limits except mildly elevated liver enzymes. No evidence of chronic liver disease or other autoimmune disorders was found.  To minimize the risk of complications such as eclampsia (seizures) or placental abruption, continuous monitoring of the patient's blood pressure, urine output, and fetal well-being was maintained throughout her hospital stay. Additionally, non-pharmacological measures like bed rest and salt restriction were advised to help manage the symptoms and decrease the severity of preeclampsia.  During her hospitalization, the patient received counseling regarding her condition and potential complications associated with preeclampsia. She was educated on self-monitoring techniques at home and instructed to report any changes in symptoms promptly.  After comprehensive management consisting of regular antenatal check-ups, routine laboratory investigations to monitor organ functions, medication adherence for blood pressure control along with close fetal surveillance through ultrasound studies over a course of three weeks in-patient care setting following admission eventually led to stabilization of both maternal blood pressure and symptom improvement.  At 33 weeks gestation, due consideration given keeping in view anticipated fetal maturity besides prevailing maternal parameters it became necessary for an early delivery plan via cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.  Ultimately a healthy baby girl weighing 2.5 kg with adequate Apgar scores at birth followed by uneventful postoperative recovery experienced thus confirming full resolution postpartum evidenced by normalization maternal BP levels along with cessation visible clinical complaints(reported headaches and visual disturbances).",continue
"During his hospital stay, the neonate's respiratory distress improved, and he was feeding well without any issues. The mother's blood group was O positive, and the baby's ABO blood group was also determined to be O positive. Blood tests were conducted to assess the neonate's liver function, coagulation profile, and complete blood count which all returned within normal ranges.  After four days, the baby was discharged home with his family. Over the next few weeks at home, the parents noticed that their baby had some intermittent episodes of lethargy and poor feeding. Initially attributing it to normal newborn behavior, they became concerned when these symptoms persisted.  Concerned about their baby's well-being, they sought medical attention at a nearby pediatric clinic where a thorough examination was performed. The physician noticed that although there were no apparent abnormalities in appearance or growth pattern for this age group (based on standard growth charts), there were some minor dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism (increased distance between eyes), broad nasal bridge, flattened philtrum (the vertical groove between nose and upper lip) with thinning vermilion border (outer part of lips), low-set ears with posterior rotation of helixes (outer rim of ear).  Based on these physical findings along with developmental concerns expressed by both parents during consultation sessions regarding delayed milestones such as lack of social interactions/engagements when compared to their older children at this age point; further investigations including genetic testing for chromosomal abnormalities were recommended.  A chromosomal microarray analysis was performed on peripheral venous blood samples from both parents and their child using high-density oligonucleotide-based array platforms capable of detecting copy number variations/alterations across the genome. This analysis revealed a 4 Mb deletion on chromosome 7p22 encompassing several genes including HDAC9 gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.  Genetic counseling provided detailed information about potential implications/repercussions of this diagnosis.  The baby was diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called Williams Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, cardiovascular abnormalities (such as supravalvular aortic stenosis), intellectual disability or learning difficulties, and certain personality traits such as friendly/outgoing personalities. The parents were informed that management would involve multidisciplinary approach including medical surveillance and providing early intervention services to optimize the child's development and quality of life.  In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of considering genetic causes in neonates presenting with dysmorphic features and developmental concerns. Prompt evaluation and appropriate genetic testing enable accurate diagnosis leading to better understanding of the condition, along with appropriate counseling for affected families. Early intervention programs are essential for optimizing developmental outcomes in children with genetic disorders like Williams Syndrome. The parents were understandably shocked and overwhelmed by the diagnosis, having never heard of Williams Syndrome before. The healthcare team reassured them that they would provide ongoing support and guidance throughout their journey.  A referral was made to a pediatric cardiologist to assess the baby's cardiovascular system due to the known association between Williams Syndrome and supravalvular aortic stenosis. An echocardiogram confirmed mild narrowing of the ascending aorta, but no immediate intervention was required. The parents were relieved to hear that although there was a potential cardiac issue, it could be managed with regular monitoring.  The family was also connected with early intervention services, which provided therapies tailored to their baby's specific needs. These interventions included physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and special education programs aimed at promoting language development and improving social interactions.  As time passed, the parents noticed improvements in their baby's feeding abilities as he started gaining weight at an appropriate pace. He began to show more engagement with his surroundings and became more interactive with his family members.  Regular visits were scheduled with the genetics team for follow-up assessments, including developmental screenings and targeted evaluations such as hearing tests and ophthalmologic exams due to associated issues like sensorineural hearing loss or vision problems in individuals with Williams Syndrome.  As he grew older, it became evident that their little one had extraordinary musical abilities - a characteristic commonly observed in individuals with this syndrome. Encouraged by this talent, his parents sought opportunities for him to explore music further through specialized classes specifically designed for children with neurodevelopmental disorders.  Throughout their journey raising a child with Williams Syndrome, the family faced challenges but also experienced incredible moments of joy and fulfillment as they witnessed their son's progress in different areas of development. They joined support groups both online and within their local community which provided them invaluable emotional support from other families who had walked similar paths.  In conclusion, this case emphasizes not only the importance of recognizing and investigating dysmorphic features and developmental concerns in newborns but also the vital role of proper genetic testing and counseling. Early diagnosis allows for proactive management plans, access to appropriate interventions, and the provision of support services that can significantly impact the long-term outcomes for children with genetic disorders like Williams Syndrome.  The journey may be full of ups and downs, but with a dedicated team of healthcare professionals alongside supportive families, children affected by Williams Syndrome can lead fulfilling lives empowered by their unique strengths.",continue
"The boy underwent an extensive surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, despite the treatment, hydrocephalus developed postoperatively due to obstructed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. A ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt was initially placed to divert CSF from the ventricles of the brain into his peritoneal cavity.  Unfortunately, two years later, the VP shunt malfunctioned, and there were no alternatives available for immediate intervention. The child's condition deteriorated rapidly as his intracranial pressure increased, leading to symptoms such as severe headache, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Recognizing the urgency of the situation and considering various factors such as his previous medical history and physical examination findings like papilledema (swelling of optic disc), it was decided to proceed with a ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt insertion through the subclavian vein.  Under sterile conditions in an operating room equipped with fluoroscopy guidance, a small incision was made in his neck near the clavicle region. The surgeon carefully accessed one of his subclavian veins using ultrasound guidance. A guidewire was then inserted through a needle into the vein while being monitored continuously on fluoroscopy for accurate placement.  Once confirmed that the guidewire was correctly positioned within a superior vena cava branch extending towards right atrium on fluoroscopy images; subsequent dilatation of this tract allowed for inserting a valve mechanism attached catheter that passed through this subcutaneous tunnel created from neck to abdomen along with exiting silicon tube outside body wall which could drain collected cerebrospinal fluid from ventricle(s) into venous circulation constantly without backing off or creating any adverse effects.  Postprocedure antibiotic prophylaxis helped prevent local or systemic infection complications which are associated risks when inserting any foreign material inside blood vessels leading up from cephalic circulation to the heart.  After successful completion of the procedure, the child's neurological symptoms gradually improved as his intracranial pressure normalized. He no longer experienced severe headaches, vomiting, or visual disturbances. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor his progress and ensure appropriate function of the VA shunt.  Although this percutaneous VA shunt placement was considered a short-term solution due to its inherent risks such as higher infection rates and higher incidence of venous occlusion; it provided immediate relief for this critical situation where other means were unavailable. Its functioning would be closely monitored in subsequent years so that a revision can be done at an appropriate age with alternative options like programmable valve VP shunts or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) if deemed feasible.  Additionally, due to his previous intramedullary spinal cord tumor diagnosis, long-term neurosurgical management was also essential. He continued to receive regular follow-ups in coordination with an oncology team for surveillance scans and assessments regarding any potential recurrence or metastasis.  The multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals played a crucial role in providing comprehensive care to address both his hydrocephalus and underlying neoplastic condition. With ongoing surveillance and timely interventions when needed, it was hoped that he would continue to thrive despite these challenging circumstances. Throughout the follow-up period, the young boy experienced significant improvement in his overall health and neurological function. Regular MRI scans were conducted to monitor the status of his brain and spinal cord, ensuring that no signs of tumor recurrence or metastasis were present. The multidisciplinary team closely analyzed each scan to identify any abnormalities or changes.  Several years passed without any major complications or issues relating to the VA shunt. The child's physical health improved, enabling him to participate in age-appropriate activities and develop normally alongside other children his age. His parents were overjoyed with his progress, grateful for the medical interventions that had saved their son's life.  However, during a routine follow-up visit when he turned 9 years old, a suspicious lesion was detected on an MRI scan of his brain. Further investigations revealed that it was indeed a recurrent tumor in close proximity to the site where the original intramedullary spinal cord tumor had been resected.  The multidisciplinary team promptly scheduled a neurosurgical intervention comprising tumor resection and subsequent oncological treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although this news was devastating for the boy's family, they remained hopeful as they had witnessed their son's resilience throughout their journey together.  The neurosurgeon skillfully performed another surgical procedure to remove as much of the recurring tumor as possible while sparing healthy tissues surrounding it. With ongoing postoperative care from an expert oncology team, including regular imaging scans and follow-ups targeting residual cells within reach, extensive therapies commenced soon after surgery in order to increase chances of success.  Despite facing multiple challenges during this prolonged course of treatment – including temporary side effects such as hair loss from chemotherapy and fatigue –the young boy remained strong-willed throughout each step of his recovery process with unwavering support from friends and family by his side.  Over time, he gradually regained vitality and strength while adapting with resilience evident through physical therapy sessions aimed at improving his gait and overall coordination. Supportive care specialists, including mental health professionals, provided comprehensive psychosocial support as he learned to cope with the emotional toll of his medical journey.  Now a teenager, this resilient young boy has defied all odds stacked against him. He is an inspiration not only to his loved ones but also to the healthcare professionals who have been involved in his care over the years.  As he continues with regular surveillance scans and follow-ups, this remarkable individual remains determined to achieve his dreams despite facing numerous obstacles along the way. His story serves as a reminder that with accurate diagnosis, timely interventions, multidisciplinary collaboration amongst experts from various medical fields combined with unrelenting hope and perseverance – amazing outcomes can be achieved even in the face of adversity.",continue
"Observation 2: Ms. V.B.'s medical history indicates that she has had a bypass surgery in November 2009, uterine fibroids, and gave birth to a child via normal delivery in March 2012. However, she recently developed a chronic progressive muscle weakness in both of her lower limbs starting in mid-August. As a result, she was admitted to the hospital from September 14th to September 21st for further evaluation and management.  Upon clinical examination upon admission, it was found that Ms. V.B. had symmetrical paresis (partial paralysis) of both lower limbs with decreased muscle strength observed as 2/5 proximally (near the trunk of the body) and slightly improved at 3/5 distally (closer to the feet). A positive Tabouret's sign was also noted, which is an indicator of weakness or limited endurance when performing repetitive muscle movements such as tapping on a surface with her foot.  Furthermore, additional neurological findings were evident during examination. The knee jerk reflex and ankle jerk reflex were absent on both sides of her lower limbs, indicating potential dysfunction or damage to the spinal cord or associated nerves responsible for these reflexes. In addition, there was no idiomuscular response observed when testing deltoid and psoas muscles – this refers to the absence of spontaneous contractions or muscular responses when stimulating these muscles.  Given these clinical findings, several diagnostic possibilities can be considered regarding the cause of Ms. V.B.'s chronic progressive muscle weakness in her lower limbs:  1) Neurological disorder: This could include conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury/compression due to degenerative disc disease or herniated disc.   2) Metabolic disorder: Muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis or myopathy are possible considerations due to potential underlying biochemical abnormalities affecting muscle function.  3) Toxic/malignant cause: Exposure to toxins or cancer-related complications can also result in progressive weakness and neurological symptoms.  To further investigate the underlying cause of her symptoms, Ms. V.B. may need additional diagnostic tests, including blood work to assess for metabolic disorders or toxins, electromyography (EMG) to evaluate the integrity of peripheral nerves and muscles, nerve conduction studies (NCS) to assess nerve function, and imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine to identify any structural abnormalities.  Additionally, a thorough medical history review should be conducted with attention given to any prior infections or recent illnesses that might have triggered an immune response leading to GBS. It would also be crucial to rule out any adverse effects related to her previous bypass surgery or uterine fibroids treatment.  The management plan should be individualized based on the final diagnosis. If a specific underlying disorder is identified, appropriate treatments such as immunoglobulin therapy for GBS, immune-modulatory medications for MS, physical therapy for disc disease-induced compression/injury could be initiated accordingly.  In conclusion, Ms. V.B.'s clinical presentation of chronic progressive muscle weakness in both lower limbs raises several possible differential diagnoses including neurological disorders like GBS or MS; metabolic disorders like muscular dystrophy; myasthenia gravis; toxic/malignant etiologies from exposure/toxins/cancer-related complications. Further investigations through diagnostic tests are warranted for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management planning tailored specifically towards her condition.",continue
"Upon examination, the fisherman appeared otherwise healthy with no signs of systemic illness. However, on closer inspection of his right knee, a raised red-purple rough spot was observed. The lesion had a crusty appearance and the adjacent skin appeared slightly inflamed. Multiple small lumps could be felt within the lesion.  Moving on to the left foot, reddish patches were noted. These patches were slightly scaly and had a well-defined border with normal-looking skin surrounding them. The patient mentioned that these patches occasionally became itchy but did not cause any pain.  To further investigate these symptoms, a thorough medical history was taken from the patient. It was discovered that he had been working as a fisherman for over 30 years, exposed to various aquatic environments and marine organisms. He reported frequent injuries while fishing, often resulting in minor cuts or wounds.  Based on this information and clinical findings, several possible diagnoses came to mind. One possibility was an occupational dermatosis caused by prolonged exposure to certain substances in marine environments or trauma from handling fishing equipment.  Another consideration was an infection caused by bacteria present in marine organisms or contaminated water sources. This would explain the recurrent pus discharge observed in the lesion on his right knee.  Given the long-standing nature of these symptoms and lack of response to self-treatment or over-the-counter remedies, further investigations were deemed necessary for an accurate diagnosis.  A skin biopsy of both lesions (the one on his right knee and left foot) was performed under local anesthesia for histopathological examination and culture studies.  Histopathological analysis revealed hyperkeratosis (thickening of stratum corneum) along with mild acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia), consistent with chronic inflammation seen in both lesions.  The presence of chronic inflammation in both lesions suggested a long-standing, ongoing problem. The culture studies performed on the samples collected from the lesions aimed to identify any specific pathogens that may be responsible for the patient's symptoms.  In addition to these diagnostic tests, blood work was ordered to assess the patient's overall health and check for any signs of systemic infection or underlying medical conditions. The results came back within normal ranges, ruling out any major underlying issues.  While waiting for the test results, a thorough examination of the patient's occupational history was conducted to gather more information about potential exposures. The fisherman mentioned handling various types of fish and marine organisms, as well as being frequently exposed to seawater.  Considering all this information together, a couple of possible diagnoses were considered: one being an occupational skin condition known as ""Fish Handler's Disease,"" and another being an infection caused by marine-based bacteria or fungi.  Fish Handler's Disease is a form of contact dermatitis that occurs due to repeated exposure to certain marine organisms such as fish scales or slime. Symptoms typically include redness, scaling, itching, and sometimes small blisters or pustules. This condition seemed relevant given the patient's occupation and prolonged exposure history.  On the other hand, infections caused by marine-based bacteria or fungi can occur through cuts or wounds when working with marine organisms or contaminated water sources. These infections often present with redness, swelling, drainage of pus mixed with blood (as observed in this case), and sometimes necrotic ulcers if left untreated.  Once the test results were available after several days from collection time were obtained they indicated negative cultures for bacterial pathogens but showed growth consistent with fungi commonly found in aquatic environments on both samples collected from his knee lesion and left foot patches. Based on these findings combined with clinical presentation it was concluded that a fungal infection called Chromoblastomycosis was most likely responsible for his symptoms.  Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by certain types of fungi found in soil, plants, and water. It often affects individuals with frequent outdoor or occupational exposure to these environments. The infection starts as small papules or nodules that slowly enlarge over time and become verrucous or cauliflower-like in appearance. The lesions may also ulcerate and discharge pus mixed with blood, similar to what the patient experienced.  Treatment for Chromoblastomycosis typically involves a combination of antifungal medications, such as itraconazole or terbinafine, taken orally for an extended period. Additionally, proper wound care should be implemented to prevent secondary infections.  The fisherman was counseled about his condition and provided with the necessary medications for treatment. He was instructed on meticulous wound care techniques to promote healing and prevent further complications. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his progress.  In conclusion, the fisherman's long-standing symptoms of raised red-purple rough spots on his knee along with reddish patches on his left foot were determined to be caused by chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection commonly seen in individuals exposed to aquatic environments. With appropriate treatment and ongoing care, it is expected that the patient will experience improvement in his symptoms over time.",continue
"Upon arrival at the pediatric emergency room, the medical team swiftly assessed the five-year-old girl's condition. The sudden onset of pain in her right lower limb, accompanied by coldness and inability to use it, raised concerns regarding a potential vascular issue. Additionally, the dark discoloration observed in the limb was indicative of compromised blood flow.  The primary focus was on understanding any possible underlying causes for this concerning presentation. The fact that an intramuscular injection had been given on the same limb hours prior raised suspicions of a potential adverse reaction to medication administration.  The medical team began by carefully evaluating her medical history for any preexisting conditions or risk factors that may have played a role in this current scenario. However, they found no evidence of sickle cell disease or bleeding tendencies which commonly result in similar symptoms.  Due to ongoing pain and worsening discoloration, urgent intervention was required to prevent further damage and salvage proper blood flow to her affected limb. An immediate doppler ultrasound scan was ordered to assess arterial blood flow through her lower extremity.  While waiting for imaging results, doctors carried out clinical examinations to gain additional insights into her condition. They noted that she complained more about exacerbating pain along with growing numbness throughout her right lower limb as time progressed.  Eventually, the doppler ultrasound scan confirmed their initial suspicions - acute arterial occlusion from an embolism had occurred within the patient's right leg due to inadvertent intra-arterial injection during benzathine penicillin administration.  Within minutes of receiving these findings, appropriate treatment measures were put into action. This vitally broke down unwanted deposits blocking proper blood circulation within her vital arteries. A skilled interventional radiologist used catheter-directed thrombolysis technique aimed at restoring regular blood flow rapidly without surgical intervention whenever possible.  As this procedure commenced promptly after diagnosis thanks to early recognition by vigilant healthcare staff members and fast availability of necessary resources such as interventional radiology, the girl could avoid potential devastating complications like compartment syndrome or irreversible tissue damage.  Subsequently, the patient was admitted for close monitoring and further management aimed at ensuring her optimal recovery. Pain control measures were initiated, and she was carefully assessed for any signs of limb-threatening compartment syndrome.  With each passing day under expert care and attention from her medical team, there were encouraging signs of progress. The pain gradually subsided, allowing the young girl to regain some mobility within her previously affected limb. The dark discoloration began to fade as blood flow progressively returned to normal.  To prevent future occurrences of such adverse events in pediatric medication administration, this incident prompted a thorough review of protocols surrounding injection practices in young children. Emphasis was placed on confirming proper needle placement prior to medication delivery and raising awareness about potential complications resulting from intra-arterial injections.  Throughout her hospital stay, healthcare professionals continued their diligent efforts towards complete restoration of both functionality and appearance within the patient's right lower limb. Various therapeutic modalities such as physiotherapy were employed to ensure optimal recovery over time.  As weeks turned into months, the girl's remarkable resilience combined with dedicated rehabilitative care yielded significantly positive outcomes. Her ability to walk normally returned, along with gradual improvement in muscle strength and coordination. The discoloration that once haunted her leg faded entirely until finally matching its counterpart on the left side.  This incident served as a reminder that prompt recognition and efficient response are crucial when confronted with potentially severe medical situations like inadvertent intra-arterial injections in pediatric patients. Its successful resolution highlighted not only the invaluable expertise found within healthcare teams but also the strength children possess during challenging times - ensuring they continue their journey towards a healthy future full of joyous playfulness once more.

"The pelvic ultrasound scan revealed a viable intrauterine pregnancy with a regular fetal heartbeat. However, it also identified a subchorionic hematoma, which is a blood clot located between the uterine wall and the chorionic membrane. This finding provided an explanation for the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.  Upon receiving these results, the gynecologist referred the patient to our hospital for further evaluation and management. On arrival, her vital signs were within normal limits, and she appeared pale but not in distress. A thorough physical examination was performed, which revealed mild tenderness on palpation of her lower abdomen.  Given her stable condition and ongoing pregnancy with a viable fetus, conservative management was chosen as the initial approach. The patient received intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and underwent serial ultrasounds to monitor both the size of the hematoma and fetal well-being.  Over the course of several weeks, there was gradual resolution of symptoms including vaginal bleeding as well as improvement in abdominal pain. Repeat ultrasounds showed that the subchorionic hematoma had decreased in size without compromising fetal growth or development.  During this time period, close monitoring by our obstetric team assured constant reassurance to alleviate concerns about possible complications such as miscarriage or premature labor. The patient reported feeling more at ease knowing that progress was being made towards resolving her symptoms while maintaining a healthy pregnancy.  At 26 weeks gestation, however unexpected circumstances arose when she experienced sudden onset severe abdominal pain associated with increased vaginal bleeding. Given this change in clinical status indicating potential complications such as placental abruption or uterine rupture related to an expanding subchorionic hematoma; immediate intervention became necessary.  An emergency cesarean section was performed promptly under general anesthesia due to maternal distress necessitating quick access to both mother and baby wellbeing. Intraoperatively significant active bleeding from an irregularly shaped hematoma at uterocervical junction became evident. It was deemed safer to proceed with a cesarean section, understanding that delivery at this time would maximize both maternal and fetal safety.  Following successful delivery, the patient was closely monitored in the postoperative period for any signs of complications such as infection or hemorrhage. She required blood transfusions due to significant blood loss during surgery and her recovery was slower compared to uncomplicated cesarean deliveries.  Histopathological examination of the removed uterus confirmed placental abruption as a result of an expanding subchorionic hematoma. The findings emphasized the importance of early detection and management of such hematomas to prevent potentially life-threatening complications for both mother and child.  The patient's clinical course also highlighted how conservative management can be effective for smaller subchorionic hematomas, but prompt intervention is warranted when faced with increasing size associated with significant symptoms or potential harm to either mother or baby.  In conclusion, this case illustrates the challenges encountered in managing a pregnant woman with a subchorionic hematoma. Early diagnosis through pelvic ultrasound scan enabled appropriate monitoring and reassurance during conservative management. However, when faced with clinical deterioration or high-risk circumstances, timely intervention becomes crucial in order to ensure the best possible outcome for both mother and baby.",continue
"Further investigations should be carried out in order to determine the cause of the patient's deteriorated general condition, fever, and abnormal blood test results. Given the presence of microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and lymphocytopenia, several differential diagnoses should be considered.  One possibility is that the patient may have an underlying infectious disease leading to her symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings. Infections such as viral illnesses or bacterial infections can often cause a decrease in white blood cell counts and platelet counts. However, it is important to note that these types of infections usually do not result in microcytic anemia.  Another consideration is a systemic autoimmune disease which can present with similar hematologic abnormalities. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for example may lead to fever along with anemia and decreased white blood cell count. Joint pain or rash might also be associated with autoimmune disorders like SLE but are not mentioned in this case presentation.  One potential explanation for the microcytic anemia could be iron deficiency. This could result from chronic bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding) or inadequate dietary intake of iron. Iron-deficiency anemia does not typically cause thrombocytopenia or leukocyte abnormalities unless there is another concurrent condition involved.  Furthermore, considering the patient's weight loss and altered general condition prior to admission, malignancy should also be considered as a potential diagnosis. Hematological malignancies such as leukemia can manifest with similar laboratory findings including pancytopenia (low numbers of red cells white cells and platelets).  To reach a definitive diagnosis for this patient’s symptoms further investigations will need to take place targeting multiple systems including more detailed hematologic investigations along side imaging for chest abdomen pelvis considering patients weight loss seemly deteriorated clinical condition especially when there was no evident heptosplenomegaly mentioned on initial examination. Additionally, the patient's medical history should be reviewed for any potential risk factors or relevant family history.  To confirm or rule out different possibilities, the following tests may be necessary: - Blood culture: This would help identify if there is an active infection present. - Viral serologies: Specific tests for viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done to determine if an underlying viral infection is causing the symptoms. - Iron studies: Measuring serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation, and total iron-binding capacity may help determine if iron deficiency is a contributing factor. - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: A bone marrow examination can provide valuable information regarding the presence of malignancy or other hematological disorders. - Imaging studies: Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound may reveal any abnormalities that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  In summary, this 28-year-old woman presents with asthenia, weight loss, fever, microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia with associated neutropenia and lymphocytopenia. Multiple differential diagnoses such as infections( including common bacterial/viral infections), systemic autoimmune diseases(like lupus Erythomatus SLE) , hematology malignancies like leukemia etc are considered. Further investigations including blood cultures,viral serology,Iron studies,bone marrow examinination alongside imaging modalities should take place in order to reach definitive diagnosis",continue
"Upon admission, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient appeared fatigued and had bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.  Laboratory investigations were conducted to further evaluate the patient's condition. Complete blood count showed leukopenia with lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests exhibited elevated liver enzymes, while renal function tests were within normal limits. Serological testing for common infectious diseases such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis A, B, C viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) all yielded negative results.  Considering the clinical presentation along with laboratory findings, viral infections remained a possibility. However, given the persistence of symptoms for more than a week and the presence of specific symptoms such as sore throat and rash without oral or nasal ulcers raised concerns about other potential etiologies.  In order to investigate further and determine an accurate diagnosis for this puzzling case, additional diagnostic procedures were conducted. A lumbar puncture was performed to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis which showed pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytes indicating possible central nervous system involvement.  To rule out any potential bacterial causes that can mimic viral infections in their presentation characteristics or secondary bacterial infections caused by an underlying viral illness; blood cultures were taken along with throat swabs for microbiological analysis. These investigations would provide valuable insights into identifying any bacterial pathogens that might be responsible for this patient's symptoms.  During hospitalization at CHBAH's isolation ward dedicated to infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB) meningitis or other airborne transmissible pathogens causing neurological manifestations; respiratory precautions such as the use of face masks were implemented to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and fellow patients.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested to evaluate whether there were any neurological abnormalities. The scan revealed leptomeningeal enhancement along with patchy nodular enhancements suggestive of meningeal inflammation, further supporting the suspicion of meningitis.  In light of these findings, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for tuberculosis was conducted on both CSF and sputum samples. This test confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in both specimens, confirming a diagnosis of tuberculosis meningitis.  The patient was promptly started on an appropriate anti-tuberculosis treatment regimen consisting initially of intravenous antibiotics followed by oral medications. Supportive care measures such as analgesics for headache relief and hydration therapy were also provided to alleviate symptoms and aid in recovery.  As Tuberculosis is an airborne disease with high transmission potential, contact tracing was performed to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the patient during his infectious period. These individuals were advised to undergo screening tests for TB infection and depending on their results, initiate preventive treatment if necessary.  Throughout his hospital stay at CHBAH, close monitoring was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team comprising infectious disease specialists, neurologists, nurses specialized in caring for patients with TB meningitis among other healthcare professionals ensuring optimal management and support.

"Upon arrival at the emergency department, the healthcare team quickly assessed the patient's vital signs. His temperature was recorded as 39.5°C (103.1°F), his blood pressure was within normal limits, and his heart rate and respiratory rate were slightly elevated. The physical examination revealed no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular or respiratory system.  Considering his symptoms and occupation, the healthcare team suspected that he might have contracted a vector-borne disease prevalent in agricultural areas. Malaria was initially ruled out due to the ineffective response to anti-malarial medications. To further investigate, a series of laboratory tests were ordered.  Blood samples were taken from the patient for complete blood count (CBC), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), and blood culture analysis. The laboratory results showed a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 13,000 cells/mm³ with neutrophilia but without significant abnormalities in liver or kidney function tests.  The healthcare team then decided to conduct a serological investigation for diseases transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes commonly found in agricultural settings such as dengue fever, chikungunya virus infection, rickettsial infections such as spotted fever group rickettsiosis (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis or Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.  The patient felt visibly fatigued with ongoing spikes of high-grade intermittent fever during his stay at the hospital. He received symptomatic management consisting of intravenous fluids for rehydration along with antipyretic medication to bring down his temperature whenever necessary.  While awaiting further investigation results, additional history was obtained from him regarding other potential exposures during recent months. On further questioning about any insect bites or rashes on skin exposure sites after outdoor activity in farms/fields/lakes/rivers/local areas he visited; he reported noticing multiple insect bites around two weeks earlier but had not given them much importance at the time. The bites were primarily around his lower extremities and forearms, with some associated itchiness that resolved spontaneously.  As the serological test results started to become available, it was discovered that the patient had significantly raised titers against rickettsial antigens: Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia conorii (a probable cause of Mediterranean spotted fever), and Borrelia burgdorferi. These findings were in line with a diagnosis of African tick-bite fever (ATBF) caused by Rickettsia africae and Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.  The patient was started on antibiotics specific for rickettsial illnesses like doxycycline while awaiting confirmatory tests for Lyme disease. Lifestyle modifications were also advised, including wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers tucked into socks when outdoors in tick-infested areas to prevent further exposure.  After thorough counseling about the diseases he had contracted along with appropriate antibiotic therapy and precautions for avoiding future ticks or insect bites, the patient showed considerable improvement in his symptoms within a few days. He was discharged from the hospital on oral doxycycline for two weeks duration along with antipyretics as needed upon follow-up outpatient care provided by an infectious disease specialist.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering vector-borne diseases as a differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with high-grade intermittent fever following outdoor activities in endemic areas. Timely recognition and appropriate management can lead to improved outcomes, preventing potential complications associated with these infections. ",continue
"Upon physical examination, the patient appeared tired and had moderate tenderness in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Her vital signs were stable, and there were no signs of jaundice or hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, as well as increased levels of C-reactive protein and liver enzymes.  To further investigate her symptoms and determine the cause of the sub-capsular hematoma, a thorough workup was initiated. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed a large hematoma involving segments VI and VII of the liver, measuring approximately 6 cm in diameter. The hematoma appeared to be compressing adjacent hepatic parenchyma but there were no signs of active bleeding or rupture.  Considering the patient's history and imaging findings, two diagnostic possibilities were considered: either spontaneous bleeding due to an underlying liver pathology or a ruptured hepatic adenoma. In order to differentiate between these two conditions, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered.  The CT scan revealed a well-defined encapsulated mass within segment VII that demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement before contrast administration and hypoattenuating lesions after administration. These imaging findings strongly suggested that this was indeed a ruptured hepatic adenoma rather than spontaneous bleeding.  Hepatic adenomas are rare benign tumors arising from hepatocytes that predominantly affect young women who are taking oral contraceptives or have underlying metabolic disorders such as obesity or diabetes mellitus type 2. Rupture is a serious complication associated with these tumors that can lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage.  Due to active bleeding being ruled out in this case by imaging studies, immediate surgical intervention was not deemed necessary at this point. The patient was started on intravenous fluids along with broad-spectrum antibiotics for infection prophylaxis due to concern for secondary infection within the hematoma.  Subsequent histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a hepatic adenoma. The patient was then counseled regarding the potential risks associated with hepatic adenomas, including the possibility of future rupture and hemorrhage. As a result, it was recommended that she undergo elective surgery to prevent any future complications.  The surgical approach chosen for this patient was a laparoscopic liver resection. A preoperative liver volumetric study was performed to assess the feasibility of this approach and ensure an adequate functional remnant liver volume after resection. The study showed that there would be sufficient residual liver function following resection, thus confirming the suitability for laparoscopic surgery.  During the surgery, the ruptured hepatic adenoma measuring approximately 7 cm in diameter was identified and carefully dissected from its surrounding tissues using laparoscopic techniques. Hemostasis was achieved, and an intraoperative ultrasound confirmed complete removal of the lesion without any residual hematomas or active bleeding.  The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery period and was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with appropriate pain management and follow-up instructions. She remains under regular surveillance to monitor for any recurrent lesions or complications.  In conclusion, we present a case of a middle-aged woman with a sub-capsular hematoma in her right liver attributed to a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Timely diagnosis through imaging modalities allowed us to differentiate between spontaneous bleeding and hemorrhage related to an underlying tumor pathology. Surgical intervention via laparoscopic liver resection proved successful in managing this rare complication while minimizing invasiveness for the patient.",continue
"Upon arrival at the emergency unit, medical staff quickly assessed the 4-year-old girl's condition. It was clear that she was experiencing severe symptoms and required immediate attention. The initial assessment revealed a number of concerning signs, including abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, vomiting, and anorexia.  The parents informed the medical team that these symptoms had been present for the past 48 hours. They explained that they had attempted to treat their daughter's condition using local herbs infused in various remedies. However, it was evident that these treatments had not yielded any positive results.  The patient appeared agitated and confused, indicating a further cause for concern. Her Glasgow Coma Scale reading of 12 (E3, V4, M5) indicated moderate neurological impairment. This was consistent with her restlessness and confusion.  The medical team continued their evaluation and recorded other vital signs as well. The patient's arterial blood pressure measured at 75/50 mm Hg which indicated low blood pressure levels which can be a sign of dehydration or infection. Her heart rate was elevated at 135 beats per minute – higher than the normal range for her age group – suggesting increased stress on her cardiovascular system due to her illness.  Body temperature is an important indicator of underlying infection or inflammation within the body – in this case; it registered at 38.9°C (102°F), indicating a high-grade fever. Additionally, respiratory rate monitoring showed she was breathing at approximately 22 cycles per minute – slightly above average but still within normal limits.  Given all these signs pointing towards a serious illness affecting multiple body systems coupled with her young age put this little girl's health under jeopardy requiring utmost care from medical professionals attending to her case.  Doctor Josué Lefèvre quickly ordered IV fluids to address hypotension caused by dehydration secondary to prolonged vomiting along with antibiotics to combat any possible bacterial infection underlying such classic symptoms like fever &amp;amp; abdominal pain.  While the medical team attended to the immediate needs of hydration and infection treatment, they also discussed possible causes for her symptoms. In this region, several endemic diseases needed to be considered. These included malaria, typhoid fever, gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria or parasites, as well as common viral illnesses.  To identify the specific cause of her symptoms and ensure appropriate treatment would be given, the doctors ordered various diagnostic tests. This would include blood tests to check for signs of infection or inflammation and a complete blood count (CBC) to assess underlying hematological conditions.  Additionally, a stool sample test was requested to screen for any bacterial or parasitic pathogens in her gastrointestinal tract. Lastly, a rapid malaria test was performed due to its high prevalence in the area.  The initial management focused on stabilizing her vital signs while waiting for test results determined likely causes that could further inform appropriate therapy decisions tailored accordingly fulfilling principles set by Benin's Ministry of Health protocol guidelines such as providing timely care using available resources with cost-effectiveness priorities without compromising quality standards while minimizing expensive investigations without clinical justification accompanying stewardship strategies protecting patients from avoidable harm associated directly with unnecessary testing at given clinical presentations presented here beforehand aiming ultimate health outcome efficiency positively impacting similarly situated vulnerable populations over time showing profound importance integrated Patient Safety &amp;amp; Efficiency concepts go hand-in-hand transcending cultural barriers fundamentally carrying significance improving global standards vastly expanding beyond singular localized objectives pivotal towards constructive outcomes realizing equal access health equity matters etc.  As time passed and results from diagnostic tests began rolling in progressively unveiling more about this little girl's mysterious illness led physicians through evidence-based optimization cycle interventions continually reevaluating prioritizing predictive factors closely collaborating exchanged insights shared experiences within their multidisciplinary teams comprising caring advanced practice registered nurses (APRN) nurse practitioners (NP) supporting patient-centered care models shared decision-making frameworks partnering collaborative worthwhile healthcare journeys families empowered facilitating do-no-harm-oriented environments promoting trustful effective communication all-inclusive among all stakeholders engaged concurrently respect one another significantly fostering constructive productive outcomes calling implicated truly capable sustainably catalyzing meaningful societal transformations across societies contributing multi-generational well-being re-echeloned systemically exponential diffusion behavioral changes continue imprinted posterity impact &amp;amp; proactive global health exemplum public paradigm shifting manifestations generatively serving contemporary humanity humanitarian resourcefulness hereby embarked influential virtuous evidence-based strategies thereby joining forces global initiatives captivating resonating universally expanding awareness sharing knowledge promoting equal access harmoniously traditional lore blending ethically mainstream medical practices transformative healthcare rapports forever evolving positively harmoniously day-to-day practicalities sacred missions assiduously affirming never underestimating potential patients' psychosocial powers extra clinical therapeutic interactions synergistically capitalizing empowerment crucial incidents impactful appreciating continuously unfolding patient storytelling chronicles enlighten illuminate narratives exercising autonomy courageously advocating wellbeing incorporated humility demonstrating adoptively embedded relentless determination unequivocally delivering universal consciousness throughout ultimately solidifying paramount sociobehavioral feedback motor providing ultimate win-win scenarios unitedly finalizing participatory inclusive formulation compassionate collaborative trustworthy safe care models ensuring shared objectives met collectively safely ambitions health capabilities potentials mutate promising progenies hopeful tomorrows transcending foreseeable realms fascinating journeys thrive taking newly paved paths blending core cultural elements future generations unanimously inviting actively engaged remarkable transitions enter renaissance-like eras exceeding expectations bravely journeyed together crossing frontiers unexplored rewarding maelstrom unforeseen improvements uplifting destinies blessing humanity perpetuity strengthening fabric building trust uniting brighter horizons plowing daunting terrains welcoming optimism's successors empowering ever-emerging exemplary individual grand architect currently threading visionaries boundlessly exegetic miles few charismatically navigating human marvels pathways sculpting memories fondly cherished earmarking timeless compassion.",continue
"Further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of a mobile mass attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The mass exhibited characteristics consistent with infective endocarditis, such as irregular shape and echogenicity, which suggested vegetation.  Blood cultures were obtained, and empiric therapy with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated to cover possible pathogens involved in infective endocarditis. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess any underlying coronary artery disease that could be contributing to his symptoms. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis or obstructions.  The blood cultures eventually grew Streptococcus viridans, confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis caused by this pathogen. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted accordingly based on susceptibility testing results.  The patient's fever subsided after a few days of appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, he continued to experience persistent chest pain and arthralgia despite improvement in his other symptoms. A thorough rheumatologic workup was initiated to evaluate for any underlying connective tissue disorders that could explain his symptoms.  Laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Additionally, antinuclear antibody (ANA) test was positive at a titer of 1:640 with speckled pattern.  Based on these findings, further autoantibody testing was performed which showed positive anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies and anti-Smith antibodies along with low complement levels.  These findings were consistent with an overlap syndrome between infective endocarditis-induced lupus-like syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Although rare, this condition has been described in literature where certain infections can trigger an autoimmune response resulting in systemic signs and symptoms usually seen in rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.  The patient was started on a low dose of prednisone along with his antibiotic treatment to control the autoimmune-mediated symptoms. Over the next few weeks, he experienced significant improvement in his chest pain and arthralgia.  Serial echocardiograms were performed to monitor the size of the mitral valve vegetation. Six weeks after initiation of antibiotics, repeat TEE showed a decrease in size and mobility of the vegetation, indicating a favorable response to treatment.  The patient was discharged with a plan for close outpatient follow-up. He continued to take appropriate antibiotic therapy for a total duration of 6 weeks based on guidelines for infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans.  At his follow-up appointments, he reported resolution of his initial symptoms and no further systemic signs indicating ongoing autoimmune activity. Repeat blood tests showed normalization of inflammatory markers and complement levels.  In conclusion, this case illustrates an uncommon overlap syndrome between infective endocarditis-induced lupus-like syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis in a patient presenting with severe chest pain, persistent fever, and arthralgia. Timely recognition and appropriate management of both infectious and autoimmune components were crucial for achieving favorable outcomes in this individual. This case highlights the importance of considering infective endocarditis as a potential cause of symptoms in patients with risk factors such as underlying cardiac disease or a history of recent infection. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.  The presence of a systolic regurgitant murmur over the mitral valve area on physical examination raised suspicion for valvular involvement, which was confirmed by echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography provided detailed imaging of the vegetations on the mitral valve, aiding in the diagnosis.  Furthermore, this case emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation when patients continue to experience symptoms despite appropriate treatment. In this patient, persistent chest pain and arthralgia prompted further investigation into possible underlying connective tissue disorders. The positive ANA test, along with specific autoantibodies and low complement levels, supported an overlap syndrome between infective endocarditis-induced lupus-like syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis.  The management approach in this case involved both antibiotics targeting the infective component as well as immunosuppression with glucocorticoids to address the autoimmune-mediated symptoms. A careful balance between controlling inflammation caused by infection while minimizing immunosuppression is necessary to optimize outcomes in these challenging cases.  Long-term follow-up is essential to ensure resolution of symptoms, complete eradication of infection, and monitor for any potential relapses or complications. Serial echocardiograms were performed to monitor changes in vegetation size and mobility over time, providing valuable feedback on treatment efficacy.  Education regarding good oral hygiene practices should be emphasized to prevent recurrent infections that could lead to recurrent episodes of infective endocarditis or exacerbation of underlying autoimmune conditions.  In conclusion, this case underscores the complexities encountered when dealing with overlapping clinical syndromes like infective endocarditis-induced lupus-like syndrome combined with rheumatoid arthritis. It highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between cardiology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases specialists in managing these challenging cases.  Recognizing and promptly addressing both the infectious and autoimmune components of the disease are vital to achieve favorable outcomes and prevent long-term complications. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of such overlap syndromes and develop optimal treatment strategies specific to each individual case.",continue
"At 3 years old, the male child presented with symptoms of fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. The parents reported that the child had been experiencing recurrent episodes of high-grade fevers for the past few months. Despite multiple visits to various healthcare providers, no specific diagnosis or treatment was suggested.  Upon examination, the child appeared pale and lethargic. His vital signs were stable except for a persistent low-grade fever of 99°F (37.2°C). A thorough physical examination revealed enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions and an enlarged liver and spleen on palpation. Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL (reference range: 11-14 g/dL), platelet count of 45,000/μL (reference range: 150,000-450,000/μL), and total leukocyte count of 2 ×10^9/L (reference range: 4-11 ×10^9/L). Peripheral smear examination revealed macrophages filled with phagocytosed blood cells.  Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) was made. MAS is a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled activation and proliferation of histiocytes leading to hypercytokinemia. It can occur as a complication in patients with underlying immunodeficiencies such as Griscelli syndrome type 2.  Griscelli syndrome type 2 is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by silvery-gray hair hypopigmentation along with immunodeficiency due to mutations in the RAB27A gene resulting in dysfunctional cytotoxic lymphocytes causing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or MAS-like features.  Further investigations were undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation in exon three of the RAB27A gene, confirming the diagnosis of Griscelli syndrome type 2. The child was started on high-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone) and specific therapy for MAS, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and cyclosporine-A.  Over the course of several weeks, there was a gradual improvement in the child's clinical condition. His fever subsided, lymphadenopathy regressed, hepatosplenomegaly decreased in size and blood counts normalized. Long-term treatment for Griscelli syndrome type 2 includes aggressive infection control measures, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine-A or etoposide to suppress immune system hyperactivity as well as genetic counseling for affected families.  The case emphasizes the importance of considering rare genetic disorders in children presenting with atypical clinical features. It also highlights the need for a multi-disciplinary approach involving pediatricians, hematologists/oncologists, geneticists, and immunologists to achieve an accurate diagnosis and initiate appropriate management promptly.  In conclusion, this case illustrates a rare presentation of Macrophage Activation Syndrome associated with Griscelli syndrome type 2 in a 3-year-old male child. It is crucial for healthcare providers to be aware of such unusual manifestations so that early recognition and treatment can be initiated to improve patient outcomes. Additionally, further research is needed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions and develop targeted therapies that can effectively manage them. Given the rarity of Griscelli syndrome type 2, there is limited information available regarding long-term prognosis and management strategies. The primary goal of treatment is to control the hyperinflammatory response associated with MAS and prevent organ damage.  In addition to the initial therapy with corticosteroids, IVIG, and cyclosporine-A, close monitoring of the child's clinical status and laboratory parameters was essential. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to evaluate response to treatment, assess for any adverse effects, and adjust medication dosages if necessary.  Genetic counseling played a crucial role in providing the family with information about the inherited nature of Griscelli syndrome type 2. The parents were counseled on potential recurrence risks in subsequent pregnancies and options for prenatal genetic testing. Supportive care measures such as education on infection prevention practices were also emphasized to minimize the risk of complications.  With ongoing treatment and support from a multidisciplinary team, including specialists in genetics, immunology, hematology/oncology, as well as nutritionists and social workers, significant progress was observed in the child's overall health.  Over time his energy levels improved significantly; he exhibited better appetite and gained weight appropriately. Follow-up laboratory tests demonstrated sustained improvement in blood counts along with regression of lymphadenopathy.  However, it is important to note that long-term management for children with Griscelli syndrome type 2 remains challenging due to potential recurrent episodes of MAS or other complications related to immunodeficiency within this population. Regular surveillance for signs or symptoms suggestive of disease flare-ups is necessary so that early intervention can be initiated promptly if needed.  Continued research into novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific molecular pathways involved in abnormal immune cell function may provide more effective treatment options for children with rare genetic disorders like Griscelli syndrome type 2.  In summary, this case report highlights an unusual presentation of Macrophage Activation Syndrome associated with Griscelli syndrome type 2 in a 3-year-old male child. Through timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and comprehensive multidisciplinary care, significant improvements were achieved in the child's health status. However, long-term management and close monitoring are essential to prevent disease recurrence and complications associated with this rare genetic disorder. Continued research efforts are necessary to further understand the underlying mechanisms of this condition and develop targeted therapies for better outcomes in affected individuals.",continue
"Further investigations were ordered for the patient to determine the cause of his symptoms. Blood tests revealed elevated liver enzymes, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), indicating liver inflammation or injury. The white blood cell count was also slightly elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection.  An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed to assess the liver and surrounding organs. It showed an enlarged liver with a hypoechoic mass within it. These findings were concerning for an abscess or a tumor in the liver. To further investigate this, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was done, which confirmed the presence of a 5 cm hepatic abscess in segment VIII of the liver.  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics immediately to target potential bacterial pathogens causing an abscess formation in the liver. A broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen that covered gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms was initiated pending results from blood cultures.  Blood cultures later returned positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common Gram-negative bacterium associated with hepatic abscesses. This finding guided antibiotic therapy adjustments to more specifically target this pathogen effectively.  As part of investigating possible sources of infection leading to hepatic abscess formation by K.pneumoniae,Serology tests were ordered which revealed positive hepatitis B surface antigen levels and antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen IgM indicating acute hepatitis B infection.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be associated with severe complications such as fulminant hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma but not necessarily linked primarily or secondarily directly causing hepatic abscesses rather what is conflicting here is how Kpneumonia bacteria could have infected him initially directly introducing itself into portal arteries staphlococcus aureus more commonly affiliated with direct seeding from bacteraemia rather than direct invasion like gas-producing organisms classically implicated in infection originating from abdominal and biliary sources.  An important consideration was to investigate the relationship between the hepatic abscess and hepatitis B infection. It is known that immunocompromised individuals, such as those with chronic hepatitis B, are at a higher risk of developing liver abscesses due to impaired immune response. However, in this case, the presence of an acute HBV infection raises questions about the potential association between primary HBV infection and hepatic abscess formation.  Given the rarity of direct invasion by K.pneumoniae causing liver abscesses originating from infections other than gastrointestinal sources typically mentioned having protean presentations like pneumonia, urinary tract infections as initially regarded as more common primary isolates through bacteriaemia before it is directly implicated it might be required to investigate hidden sources which usually would require imaging modalities such as gastrointestinal endoscopy or appropriate radiological means like CT abdomen without contrast looking for any evidence of diverticula or bowel abnormalities atypical for his age however immune status given underlying hepatitis may be contributory with subsequent investigations have been planned for appropriate diagnosis.  The patient's condition gradually improved over the course of several days on broad-spectrum antibiotics specific to K.pneumoniae. Repeat blood cultures were negative after five days indicating an adequate response to therapy. He remained afebrile, and his abdominal pain significantly improved. Serial ultrasound scans showed decreased size and resolution of the hepatic abscess.  The patient was ultimately discharged home on oral antibiotics with close follow-up planned for monitoring both his hepatitis B infection and ongoing resolution of the hepatic abscess.  In conclusion, this case illustrates a rare presentation of a hepatic abscess in a previously healthy young man associated with acute hepatitis B infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae.It highlights that clinicians should consider less common etiologies when confronted with unusual clinical scenarios guiding them towards appropriate diagnostic investigation leading to timely interventions improving their outcomes rather than ordinarily encountered organisms can have protean presentations confounding diagnosis and delayed interventions.",continue
"Upon admission, the infant appeared restless and agitated, with intermittent crying spells. Her vital signs were within normal limits, showing no signs of distress. The physical examination revealed a slightly distended abdomen with moderate tenderness on palpation. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.  Given the history provided by the parents, it was essential to assess each symptom and potential factors contributing to the infant's distress separately.  Firstly, addressing the difficulty in bowel movements over the past two days suggested a possible gastrointestinal issue. A thorough abdominal examination warranted further investigation into possible causes such as constipation or obstruction. An abdominal X-ray was ordered to rule out obstructive causes and assess for any signs of bowel dilation or free air.  Secondly, considering that she had vomited earlier in addition to being irritable after head trauma raised concerns regarding an intracranial injury. It was crucial to evaluate for any neurological deficits or changes in mental status indicating potential brain damage resulting from her fall.  The infant was admitted for observation and obtained a head CT scan to assess any underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI). It revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture but indicated mild cerebral edema likely related to her fall. Neurological examinations were performed frequently over 24 hours to ensure there were no neurological sequelae evolving as a result of this TBI.  Concurrently, laboratory investigations were conducted including complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and blood gas analysis - all returning normal values within range except slightly elevated white blood cell count indicative of inflammation or infection process ongoing in her body.  Intravenous fluids were administered along with nasogastric decompression due to persistent episodes of vomiting experienced by the patient since admission. Gastroenteritis secondary to viral infection could be considered given her symptoms including vomiting and abdominal distention; thus we initiated empiric antibiotics therapy until we obtained stool culture results excluding bacterial enteritis.  While awaiting the stool culture results, a contrast enema study was performed to visualize any possible anatomical abnormalities or rectal obstruction that may have contributed to her constipation. The study revealed no structural abnormalities, further supporting the diagnosis of functional constipation.  Efforts were made to relieve her constipation through dietary modifications such as increased fluid intake and fiber-rich foods. Additionally, laxatives were administered under close monitoring to avoid dependency on them in the long term.  During her hospital stay, with meticulous observation by nursing staff and frequent reassurance from healthcare providers, the infant displayed gradual improvement in signs and symptoms. Her bowel movements became more regular without added discomfort. The vomiting episodes subsided entirely after initiation of nasogastric decompression, replenishment with intravenous fluids, and anti-emetic medications.  As she continued responding positively to treatment for both head injury and gastrointestinal complaints over the next few days, it became evident that her clinical picture was multifactorial - a combination of an acute head injury following a fall along with functional constipation exacerbating abdominal discomfort leading to vomiting spells.  Before discharge from the hospital, thorough counseling regarding prevention strategies were provided including maintaining safe surroundings for infants who are at risk of falls due to increasing mobility. Furthermore, educating parents about normal bowel habits in infants as well as appropriate dietary modifications aimed at preventing functional constipation proved vital in this case.  Follow-up appointments ensured ongoing support and evaluation of the infant's progress regarding resolution of both conditions experienced during this admission - providing reassurance not only for parents but also promoting their confidence in managing future medical issues which may arise.  In conclusion, this case emphasizes how seemingly unrelated symptoms can converge into one complex clinical presentation requiring thorough evaluation and management. The comprehensive approach taken by our medical team helped identify separate contributing factors involving both head trauma secondary to falling incident along with gastrointestinal disturbances leading towards an optimal outcome for this otherwise healthy infant.",continue
"On examination, the patient appeared to be in discomfort and was slightly anxious. The right labia majora was significantly enlarged, red, and tender to touch. There were no obvious signs of trauma or lacerations on the external genitalia.  The patient gave a detailed history of her sexual activity with her partner. They had been engaging in regular consensual sexual intercourse without any issues or complications prior to this incident. She denied any previous episodes of similar swelling or discomfort after sexual activity.  Considering the rapid onset and severity of symptoms, a thorough evaluation was carried out to identify the underlying cause. The patient's vital signs were stable, with no signs of systemic illness or fever.  A complete blood count (CBC) was performed, which revealed slightly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count but within normal range for an infection response. The differential count showed a predominance of neutrophils which indicated an acute inflammatory process occurring in response to an infection.  Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of Bartholin's gland abscess was made. Bartholin's glands are small glands located near the opening of the vagina that secrete fluids to lubricate and protect during sexual activity.  In some cases, these glands can become blocked leading to accumulation of fluid and subsequent infection. This can result in the formation of an abscess causing pain and swelling in the affected area.  To confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment options, further investigations were required. Ultrasound imaging was performed on the right labia majora region which revealed a collection consistent with abscess formation within one Bartholin's gland duct.  The patient was prepared for immediate incision and drainage under local anesthesia as it is considered both diagnostic and therapeutic for such cases. Informed consent regarding possible complications including bleeding, scarring or recurrence after drainage procedure were discussed thoroughly before proceeding with intervention under strict sterilized conditions.  Once anesthesia was administered locally by infiltrating lidocaine into the area, a small incision was made over the abscess site. Pus and necrotic debris were then drained from the cavity, and appropriate culture samples were taken for microbiological analysis.  Post-drainage, the patient experienced immediate relief from pain and swelling. Instructions for wound care including warm compresses, sitz baths with antiseptic additives and analgesics were provided. Antibiotics were prescribed based on culture reports to target potential causative organisms.  The patient was advised to return for follow-up examination in one week to assess healing progress and address any concerns or complications that may arise.  Bartholin's gland abscess is a relatively common gynecological condition that can occur in women of reproductive age. The most common causative organisms are usually sexually transmitted bacteria such as Escherichia coli or various anaerobes.  Prevention involves good personal hygiene practices including regular washing of the genital area with mild soap after sexual activity, avoiding aggressive instrumentation during intercourse, and using appropriate barrier methods such condoms.  This case exemplifies the importance of prompt evaluation and early intervention in managing gynecological conditions like Bartholin's gland abscess. Timely treatment not only relieves symptoms but also prevents complications such as cellulitis or sepsis.  ANAKO Mother and Child Medical Centre is dedicated to providing comprehensive care for women's health issues by offering prompt diagnostic capabilities coupled with effective treatment options.",continue
"Further examination was carried out to determine the cause of the woman's symptoms. Blood tests were performed, revealing a mild leukocytosis with a left shift and thrombocytopenia. Her liver function tests showed elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). A peripheral blood smear was also obtained, which revealed the presence of atypical lymphocytes.  Given her clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a suspicion of an infectious etiology was raised. The ulcer on her arm near the axilla seemed particularly concerning. The medical team decided to collect samples from the ulcer for further investigation.  A skin biopsy was performed on the ulcer site, and histopathological analysis indicated features suggestive of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Additional testing confirmed this diagnosis when Leishmania parasites were identified in the tissue sample using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.  Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted through bites from infected sandflies. In Tunisia, this disease is endemic in certain regions, including areas surrounding Tunis. Infected sandflies are commonly found in rural or peri-urban areas where humans come into contact with them while engaging in activities such as agriculture or construction work.  The characteristic skin lesions seen in cutaneous leishmaniasis can vary widely depending on the infecting species of Leishmania and individual host factors. Lesions may appear as erythematous plaques with rolled borders, ulcers with crusts or erosions like those observed on this patient's arm near her axilla.  Though most cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis present solely with skin lesions that heal spontaneously within months without scarring, systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue may occasionally occur along with visceral involvement if left untreated. Given this patient's persistent fever and fatigue along with other non-specific symptoms, it was essential to evaluate for possible visceral leishmaniasis involvement. Visceral leishmaniasis is a more severe form of the disease that affects internal organs and can be life-threatening if left untreated.  Further investigations were initiated to assess for potential visceral involvement. A bone marrow aspirate was obtained, and microscopic examination revealed the presence of Leishmania amastigotes, confirming disseminated visceral leishmaniasis.  The patient was promptly started on a treatment regimen consisting of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, which is the drug of choice for severe or complicated cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Oral paromomycin was also added as a secondary therapy to ensure complete eradication of the infection.  During her hospitalization, her fever resolved gradually over one week following initiation of treatment. Her other symptoms also improved significantly, including the fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints she had been experiencing.  After completion of her inpatient treatment course, she continued receiving oral paromomycin as an outpatient for several weeks until further follow-up evaluation confirmed clinical resolution and parasitological cure.  This case highlights the importance of considering infectious causes when evaluating patients with persistent fever accompanied by constitutional symptoms. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can present with diverse clinical manifestations depending on multiple factors; thus, careful assessment through dermatological exam and appropriate laboratory investigations are crucial for accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation to prevent complications associated with this neglected tropical disease.",continue
"The patient was immediately given a diagnostic workup to determine the cause of his sudden onset dysarthria and mental confusion. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed no acute intracranial lesions or evidence of bleeding. The next step was to perform blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests, liver function tests, lipid profile, and coagulation studies.  The CBC showed no abnormalities, ruling out the possibility of an infection or hematological disorder. Renal and liver function test results were within normal limits, indicating that these organs were functioning properly. The lipid profile showed mildly elevated levels of LDL cholesterol but did not appear to be significantly related to the patient's current condition.  Further investigations included an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmias. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function without any evidence of valvular abnormalities or intracardiac masses.  Given the patient's medical history as a diabetic and hypertensive individual who also had a previous history of alcoholism, an ischemic stroke seemed plausible. However, considering that his symptoms were relatively mild in comparison to typical stroke presentations and there were no focal neurological deficits found upon examination, another possible diagnosis came into consideration: hypoglycemia-induced encephalopathy.  Given his low capillary blood glucose level and glycosuria on urine dipstick test without ketonuria (indicating absence of ketoacidosis), it became evident that hypoglycemia was indeed the cause behind his sudden onset dysarthria and mental confusion. Although metformin is not typically associated with hypoglycemic episodes due to its mechanism of action in reducing glucose production rather than increasing insulin secretion like sulfonylureas do; however metformin can lead rarely to lactic acidosis when concurrent acute impacting diseases that could deteriorate the patient’s clinical condition occur, so treatment with insulin was considered instead, which can cause hypoglycemia (although metformin should have been discontinued during hospitalization).   The patient was promptly administered 25 grams of intravenous glucose, and his symptoms started to improve within minutes. His dysarthria resolved, and his mental confusion began to fade away. Continuous monitoring of his blood glucose levels indicated a successful recovery from hypoglycemia.  Further discussions were held with the patient regarding lifestyle modifications to better manage his diabetes and hypertension. He was advised to closely monitor his blood sugar levels throughout the day and adjust his diet accordingly. The importance of regular exercise, limiting alcohol consumption (due to history), medication adherence (metformin proper use), and regular follow-ups were emphasized.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering hypoglycemia as a potential cause for sudden onset dysarthria and mental confusion in patients with risk factors like diabetes or alcoholism. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential in preventing further complications or neurological damage associated with prolonged hypoglycemia episodes. Healthcare professionals must be thorough in their investigations to differentiate between various etiologies for similar presentations and provide appropriate management plan accordingly Moreover, it is crucial to assess a patient's medication regimen and history, as certain medications like insulin can induce hypoglycemia. In this case, although metformin was the patient's primary medication for diabetes management, the possibility of other contributing factors cannot be ruled out. It is possible that interactions between metformin and other medications or underlying physiological changes played a role in his hypoglycemic episode.  To prevent future hypoglycemic episodes, close monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be imperative. The patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia so that he can take immediate action if such an episode occurs again. Additionally, regular follow-ups with healthcare professionals will help ensure that his diabetes management plan remains effective and appropriate modifications are made as needed.  Given the patient's history of hypertension and alcoholism (even though he has been weaned off alcohol for several years), steps should also be taken to optimize his blood pressure control. Lifestyle changes including maintaining a healthy diet low in sodium and saturated fats along with regular physical activity should be encouraged. In some cases, antihypertensive medications may need to be adjusted or added to achieve optimal blood pressure control.  Education about the risks associated with alcohol consumption, particularly in individuals with a history of alcoholism or those taking certain medications like amilodipine (calcium channel blocker), should also be provided. It is important for patients to understand the potential interactions between alcohol and their current medication regimen.  Regular medical check-ups will also aid in monitoring any complications associated with these chronic conditions such as diabetic neuropathy or retinopathy. Furthermore, mental health support may benefit older patients who have experienced mental confusion episodes due to underlying medical conditions like hypoglycemia.  In summary, this case underscores the importance of considering various etiologies when presented with sudden onset dysarthria and mental confusion in older patients, especially those with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Hypoglycemia should be included in the differential diagnosis, particularly when there is a history of diabetes or alcoholism. Prompt recognition and immediate management of hypoglycemic episodes are vital to prevent further complications and optimize patient outcomes. With proper medication adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-ups, the patient can attain better control over his chronic conditions and reduce the likelihood of future episodes. Effective multidisciplinary care involving healthcare professionals from various specialties will be essential to address all aspects of the patient's health needs comprehensively.",continue
"Further laboratory tests revealed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3,000/mm³ and lymphopenia with a lymphocyte count of 700/mm³. Additionally, the patient had thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 80,000/mm³. These findings indicated a possible hematological disorder.  Autoimmune markers were also tested and antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive at a titer of 1:640 with homogeneous pattern. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected, supporting the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Complement levels were decreased; C3 was at 60 mg/dL (normal range: 90-180 mg/dL) and C4 was at 10 mg/dL (normal range:10-40 mg/dL).  To assess any organ involvement, further investigations were performed. Echocardiography showed no significant abnormalities in cardiac structure or function. Renal function tests showed elevated creatinine levels at 1.8 mg/dL (normal range:0.6-1.2 mg/dL) and proteinuria at 2000mg/24h (normal range:<150mg/24h), indicating possible renal involvement.  A kidney biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate disease severity. The biopsy revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis characterized by mesangial proliferation, endocapillary proliferation, subendothelial deposits, cellular crescents formation indicating severe renal involvement in SLE.  Considering all these clinical findings along with the diagnostic assessment results, it was clear that this patient had developed systemic lupus erythematosus affecting multiple organs including her joints, skin, kidneys and hematological system.  Treatment for SLE involves both symptomatic management to control symptoms such as joint pain and inflammation, as well as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to slow down the progression of the disease and prevent complications. In this case, the patient was started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management and high-dose corticosteroids to control inflammation.  Due to the severity of renal involvement, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide was also initiated. The patient was closely monitored for potential side effects such as myelosuppression and bladder toxicity associated with cyclophosphamide.  As part of long-term management, the patient was educated about self-care strategies including sun protection due to photosensitivity associated with SLE, regular exercise to maintain joint flexibility and general well-being, and adherence to medications as prescribed. Close follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her response to treatment and adjust therapy if needed.  Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can have devastating effects on various organ systems. Early recognition of symptoms along with prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment is crucial in order to prevent irreversible organ damage and improve quality of life for individuals affected by this condition. With adequate support from healthcare professionals, patients can effectively manage their symptoms and achieve better long-term outcomes. In addition to pharmacological management, the patient was advised to make certain lifestyle modifications to help manage her condition. This included adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting processed foods and saturated fats. Regular exercise and stress management techniques such as meditation or yoga were also recommended.  Furthermore, the patient was educated about the importance of sun protection to prevent flare-ups of her malar rash and photosensitivity. She was advised to use sunscreen with a high SPF, wear protective clothing, and avoid direct sunlight during peak hours.  Psychosocial support was offered to the patient as well because living with a chronic illness like SLE can have significant emotional impact. Support groups or counseling services were suggested to help her cope with any anxiety or depression that may arise from managing this complex disease.  As part of her ongoing care plan, regular monitoring of laboratory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), complement levels, complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests including creatinine and urine protein levels would be carried out. These tests would serve as indicators for disease activity and response to treatment.  The multidisciplinary approach involved rheumatologists who specialized in treating autoimmune diseases like SLE, nephrologists for managing renal involvement, dermatologists for addressing skin manifestations such as malar rash and alopecia, along with other healthcare professionals who provided holistic care tailored specifically for each organ system affected by the disease.  Patient education played a pivotal role in ensuring adherence to medication regimens, recognizing early signs of flare-ups or complications that required immediate medical attention. The importance of routine check-ups even during periods of remission were emphasized so that any potential relapse could be detected early on.  Over time with proper management strategies in place coupled with regular follow-up visits closely monitored by healthcare professionals specialized in autoimmune diseases like SLE; it is possible for patients to achieve disease control and minimize long-term organ damage.  In this case, the patient responded well to the initial treatment plan. Her joint pain and inflammation reduced, while her renal function stabilized over time. Regular check-ups ensured early detection of any signs of disease activity or organ involvement, allowing prompt adjustment of treatment as needed.  Living with systemic lupus erythematosus can be challenging, but with ongoing medical support, adherence to treatment plans and lifestyle modifications; individuals can lead fulfilling lives by managing their symptoms effectively. It is crucial for patients to be aware that they are not alone in this journey and that a network of healthcare professionals is available to provide guidance, support, and personalized care every step of the way.",continue
"Upon returning to the emergency room, the 9-month-old boy was immediately assessed by medical personnel. His vital signs were stable, but he appeared irritable and in distress. The parents reiterated their concern about his inability to bear weight on his right lower extremity and the persistence of both ankle pain and fever.  The attending physician performed a thorough physical examination of the child's ankle. It was evident that there was swelling and tenderness overlying the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. Further evaluation with a series of X-rays was requested to investigate any possible fractures or other abnormalities.  The X-ray results came back, showing no signs of acute fracture or dislocation in the ankle joint. However, there were radiolucent areas within the talus bone suggestive of osteomyelitis, which is an infection within the bone tissue itself. This finding raised concerns among the medical team as osteomyelitis in infants can be a serious condition requiring immediate treatment.  Given these findings, blood samples were taken from the child for laboratory testing including complete blood count (CBC) and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The results showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) along with increased levels of CRP and ESR, confirming an active inflammatory process within his body.  Consequently, intravenous antibiotics were initiated promptly to target potential bacterial pathogens causing osteomyelitis. Pain management measures were also implemented to alleviate discomfort experienced by this young patient during treatment.  As part of ongoing monitoring for complications associated with osteomyelitis in infants, close evaluation by specialists such as pediatric orthopedic surgeons or infectious disease physicians was considered essential throughout his hospital stay.  In consultation with an orthopedic specialist familiar with pediatric cases like this one, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans became necessary for assessing bone involvement more precisely and identifying any potential abscess formation around the infected area. The MRI revealed an abscess within the talus bone, thereby confirming the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.  Over the next few days, the child showed gradual improvement with a decrease in his ankle pain and fever. His appetite improved, and he became more active and responsive. This favorable response to treatment was a promising sign that his body was effectively combating the infection.  However, it was important to complete the full course of intravenous antibiotics to ensure eradication of all bacteria causing osteomyelitis to prevent relapse or development of chronic disease. Close follow-up appointments were scheduled after discharge for regular monitoring of his progress and evaluation for any complications or recurrence.  In conclusion, this 9-month-old boy initially presented with symptoms suggestive of a talus fracture following an ankle trauma but continued to experience pain and fever despite immobilization and initial treatment measures. Further investigation revealed osteomyelitis in the talus bone as an underlying cause for these persistent symptoms. Prompt recognition, appropriate diagnostic imaging studies such as X-rays and MRI scans, along with early initiation of intravenous antibiotics proved crucial in managing this serious condition effectively. Collaboration between specialists from various disciplines further ensured optimal care delivery throughout this challenging case.",continue
"Upon admission to the emergency room, immediate medical intervention was required to address the patient's loss of consciousness and recurrent seizures. The medical team quickly conducted a physical examination, which revealed an altered level of consciousness and postictal confusion in the patient.  Considering the patient's history of epilepsy, it was crucial to assess any potential triggers or underlying causes that may have led to this severe seizure episode. The parents mentioned that their child had been regularly taking sodium valproate, an antiepileptic drug known for its efficacy in controlling seizures. However, they also noted that there had been a significant increase in seizure frequency recently.  The preceding flu-like syndrome raised concerns as a possible precipitating factor for these severe seizures. It is well-established that infections can provoke seizures in individuals with epilepsy due to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased excitability in neural networks. Additionally, inadequate control of fever during an infection can further lower seizure threshold.  The unsuccessful management using acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ascorbic acid indicated a need for more effective management strategies targeting both symptom relief and underlying inflammation. The medical team promptly initiated appropriate treatments to halt the ongoing seizure activity while also addressing potential causes.  As part of diagnostic workup, laboratory investigations were ordered to assess the patient's current condition comprehensively. Blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel analysis, liver function tests (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs), inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) were conducted.  In addition to blood tests, lumbar puncture was considered to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for any signs of infection or inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). This procedure would help rule out other potential causes such as encephalitis or meningitis.  Neuroimaging studies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were contemplated after stabilizing the patient to assess any structural abnormalities or possible causes for the severe seizure episode. It would aid in detecting any lesions, hemorrhages, or underlying conditions that may influence the management and prognosis of epilepsy.  To manage the ongoing seizures, a combination of antiepileptic medications was administered intravenously to quickly achieve seizure control. Benzodiazepines, such as midazolam or lorazepam, were commonly used for their potent anticonvulsant effects in emergency settings. Additionally, other antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin or levetiracetam could be considered to maintain seizure control in the long term.  While managing acute symptoms and addressing potential triggers is crucial in this case, long-term management aiming at better control of seizures becomes paramount after stabilizing the patient's condition. Close monitoring by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy would ensure adjustments in medication dosages and possible addition of new treatment modalities.  Furthermore, counseling sessions with both the patient and his parents regarding adherence to medication schedules, recognizing prodromal symptoms or triggers for seizures become necessary for optimal management. The importance of continuous communication between healthcare professionals and patients/families should also be emphasized.  In conclusion, this case highlights a 14-year-old epileptic patient presenting with loss of consciousness and severe tonic-clonic seizures following a flu-like syndrome. Prompt medical intervention involving comprehensive diagnostic investigations helped determine potential triggers and manage acute symptoms effectively through a combination of antiepileptic medications. Long-term management focusing on optimizing seizure control through medication adjustments and adherence support is crucial in ensuring improved outcomes for this patient living with epilepsy.",continue
"Further investigations were carried out to determine the cause of the baby's lethargy and decreased oxygen saturation. Blood tests revealed a low hemoglobin level of 8.5g/dL, with normal white blood cell count and platelet levels. The baby's blood gas analysis showed mild metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.25 and base deficit of -6 mmol/L.  An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the suspicion of duct dependent congenital heart disease. It revealed no structural abnormalities in the heart or major vessels; however, it did show evidence of severe anemia. The baby was subsequently transfused with packed red blood cells, resulting in improvement in his overall condition.  Given the absence of structural heart defects on echocardiography and considering the severity of anemia in this newborn, further investigations were pursued to identify potential causes for his presentation. Coombs test was negative ruling out hemolytic disease due to ABO or Rh incompatibility.  Additional laboratory investigations including serum iron studies, vitamin B12 level, folic acid level, peripheral blood smear examination for red cell morphology were all within normal limits ruling out common causes such as iron deficiency anemia or megaloblastic anemia.  The next step was to investigate for any underlying genetic factors that could be contributing to this newborn's presentation. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed which revealed a previously unreported microdeletion on chromosome 1p36 region.  The parents were counseled regarding the findings and implications associated with this microdeletion syndrome. They underwent genetic counseling aimed at estimating recurrence risks as well as providing support for future pregnancies.  Microdeletion syndromes are rare chromosomal disorders caused by small deletions involving one or more genes along a particular chromosomal region resulting in distinct phenotypic features associated with each syndrome. The 1p36 deletion syndrome is one such example characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and in some cases, congenital heart defects.  The severe anemia observed in this newborn is an atypical feature of 1p36 deletion syndrome; however, there have been few reported cases describing the association of 1p36 deletion syndrome with various hematological abnormalities. The exact mechanism underlying these hematological manifestations remains unclear and requires further investigation.  In conclusion, we present a case of a newborn boy with lethargy and decreased oxygen saturation initially suspected to have duct dependent congenital heart disease. However, subsequent investigations revealed a previously unreported microdeletion on chromosome 1p36 region associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. The presence of severe anemia in this infant is an atypical finding for this microdeletion syndrome but highlights the need for thorough investigation in cases where the clinical presentation deviates from the expected phenotype. Further research is warranted to better understand the genetic basis of these hematological manifestations and their potential implications for patient management. The baby was closely monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to manage his condition appropriately. He received transfusions of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels and improve his anemia. Regular assessments of his oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory status were conducted to ensure stable vital signs.  Developmental support services were also involved to assess the baby's developmental milestones and provide early intervention resources if required. The parents were provided with information about developmental surveillance, therapy services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy that could potentially benefit their child.  In addition, the multidisciplinary team included a geneticist who discussed the chromosomal microarray analysis findings with the parents. They were educated about the possible implications of 1p36 deletion syndrome on their child's overall development and potential associated medical concerns in order to address any future challenges proactively.  Regular follow-up visits were scheduled for this newborn with different specialties including cardiology for continued monitoring of cardiac function despite no major structural abnormalities found initially. Genetic counseling sessions continued providing emotional support and answering any questions or concerns raised by the parents regarding future pregnancies or familial recurrence risks.  As this case highlights an atypical presentation of 1p36 deletion syndrome including severe anemia in a newborn, it underscores the importance of considering chromosomal microarray analysis as part of initial investigations in cases where there is unexplained clinical deterioration or suspicion for underlying genetic disorders even when typical features may be absent.  Genetic testing provides crucial information essential for accurate diagnosis which then leads to appropriate management plans tailored specifically for each patient. In cases involving rare conditions like microdeletion syndromes, such comprehensive evaluations can contribute towards expanding our understanding about unusual presentations and further improving patient care through early detection.  This case also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration involving various medical specialties from pediatrics to genetics as well as supportive services like developmental support teams. Such collaborative efforts enable comprehensive care and ongoing follow-up to address the complex needs of patients with rare genetic disorders.  As more cases are reported and studied, we can increase our knowledge about these microdeletion syndromes, their associated manifestations, and potential treatment modalities. This will aid in better counseling for parents and families affected by these conditions, improving long-term outcomes for children with chromosomal abnormalities.  In conclusion, this case report presents a newborn boy with an atypical presentation of 1p36 deletion syndrome including severe anemia. Genetic testing revealed a previously unreported microdeletion on chromosome 1p36 region. Multidisciplinary management involving neonatology, cardiology, genetics, developmental support services played a crucial role in providing appropriate care to this infant and counseling his parents for future implications. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms contributing to such hematological abnormalities in microdeletion syndromes to enhance patient care strategies further.",continue
"On further examination, the patient exhibited a wide range of dental abnormalities. Her oral hygiene was fair with no visible signs of decay or periodontal disease. However, her upper front permanent teeth were indeed unerupted, causing concern for both the patient and her parents.  The patient's medical and dental history was thoroughly assessed to determine any underlying causes for her dental abnormalities. The absence of significant systemic illness ruled out several conditions, such as endocrine disorders and certain genetic syndromes that can affect tooth eruption. Additionally, there were no signs of harmful habits like excessive thumb sucking or tongue thrusting that might hinder normal tooth development.  However, the physical characteristics observed in the patient raised suspicion for a particular condition called Turner syndrome (TS). This genetic disorder affects females and is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome in some or all body cells. TS can lead to a variety of physical traits and medical issues including short stature, delayed puberty, heart problems, hearing loss, and infertility.  To confirm this suspicion and to assess any other possible associated anomalies related to TS, various diagnostic tests were conducted. These included a karyotype analysis that confirmed an abnormality involving one X chromosome in the patient's cells consistent with Turner syndrome diagnosis.  Further investigations revealed additional signs commonly associated with TS such as hypothyroidism (indicated by thin eyebrows), nail abnormalities (spoon-shaped slow-growing nails with onychorrhexis), webbed neck (not mentioned previously), short stature relative to age group norms—for instance being shorter than peers at 18 years old—and renal abnormalities like horseshoe kidney anomaly (not mentioned previously).  Treatment planning focused not only on addressing the unerupted upper front permanent teeth but also on managing other potential health concerns associated with TS. In consultation with an inter-disciplinary team including endocrinologists and gynecologists specializing in adolescent medicine among others—specific plans were made tailored to the patient's needs.   For her dental concerns, orthodontic treatment was proposed after further evaluation of the position and condition of the unerupted teeth using radiographic imaging techniques such as a panoramic radiograph or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). This would help determine whether a simple orthodontic approach, such as creating space for eruption by expanding the upper jaw arch or surgical intervention, would be necessary.  In addition to orthodontics, regular dental check-ups were recommended to closely monitor oral health and address any issues promptly. Given TS predisposes individuals to increased risks of dental anomalies such as delayed eruption and enamel hypoplasia among others—diligent care is essential for maintaining optimal oral health.  For her overall well-being, hormone therapy was initiated to address her hormonal imbalances related to puberty and potential fertility issues. Regular follow-ups with endocrinology specialists were scheduled to monitor hormone levels and ensure proper growth and development through adolescence.  Emotional support was also emphasized throughout treatment due to the potential impact that Turner syndrome can have on body image perception and self-esteem. Counseling services were made available for the patient and her family members as needed.  This case highlights not only the importance of careful observation during physical examinations but also demonstrates how dentists may play an instrumental role in identifying underlying systemic conditions through oral manifestations. By working in collaboration with other medical professionals, comprehensive care can be provided for patients like this young female with Turner syndrome, ensuring both their oral health needs are met while addressing their overall physical well-being.",continue
"As a language model AI, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or ethical for me to make assumptions about the medical condition of the patient without the necessary expertise. However, I can suggest a possible direction for the story based on the information provided.  Upon hearing the patient's comment about his ""different appearance,"" Dr. Patel, an experienced physician at RK Khan Hospital, became intrigued and decided to further investigate. He asked the patient about his specific concerns regarding his appearance and patiently listened as he explained that he had noticed some unusual features such as dark spots on his skin and patches of thicker hair growth in certain areas.  Recognizing these symptoms as potential indicators of a genetic disorder or syndrome, Dr. Patel ordered a detailed physical examination and consulted with other specialists in dermatology and genetics within the hospital. The young man underwent various tests including bloodwork, skin biopsy, and genetic analysis.  After weeks of testing and waiting anxiously for results, Dr. Patel finally received confirmation from genetics specialists that their suspicions were correct - the young man had been living with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal cell growth in numerous parts of the body.  With this diagnosis in hand, Dr. Patel sat down with Mark (the patient) along with his parents to discuss their findings in detail. NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17q11 which affects approximately 1 out of every 3-4 thousand people worldwide.  Dr. Patel emphasized that although NF1 is typically diagnosed during childhood due to its characteristic signs such as cafe-au-lait macules (dark spots) on the skin and benign peripheral nerve tumors known as neurofibromas; it can sometimes present later or have milder symptoms initially.  Mark was relieved to finally understand why he looked different from others around him but was also concerned about potential future complications. Dr. Patel explained that NF1 is highly variable in its expression, meaning that it can manifest itself in different ways for each individual. While some people with NF1 have minimal symptoms and lead relatively normal lives, others experience more severe complications such as learning disabilities, vision problems, or even tumors affecting the nervous system.  To ensure proper management and monitoring of Mark's condition, Dr. Patel referred him to a team of specialists including dermatologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, and genetic counselors who would work together to create a comprehensive care plan tailored to his specific needs.  Over time, Mark learned how to manage his symptoms with the help of various treatment options including regular check-ups (skin examinations), specialized glasses for visual impairments related to NF1-related optic pathway gliomas (tumors), and educational support to assist with any learning difficulties he might encounter.  Through this journey of self-discovery and medical intervention at RK Khan Hospital in Durban-South Africa; Mark realized that though he may look different from others due to his neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosis - it does not define him as a person. With ongoing care from knowledgeable healthcare professionals like Dr. Patel and the loving support of his family, he was able to embrace himself fully despite any challenges ahead.  In conclusion, this young man's journey reminds us about the importance of both physical and mental health support for individuals living with rare medical conditions such as neurofibromatosis type 1. It also highlights the crucial role played by skilled doctors like Dr. Patel who are dedicated to helping their patients overcome obstacles while affirming their unique identity",continue
"Upon examination, baby NU presented with a remarkable physical appearance. The absence of skin and skull bone resulted in his brain being exposed, giving the impression that his head was only comprised of brain matter. This condition is known as anencephaly.  Anencephaly is a severe birth defect where the neural tube does not close completely during early embryonic development. As a result, most infants diagnosed with this condition do not survive beyond a few hours or days after birth. This diagnosis was devastating news for baby NU's parents, who were hopeful of delivering a healthy child.  To better understand the reasons behind this congenital anomaly, further investigations were conducted. Genetic counseling was provided to both parents to explore any potential genetic factors involved in this condition. Given that the parents were cousins, consanguinity could have played a role in increasing the risk of genetic disorders.  Additionally, it was crucial to rule out any exposure to teratogenic substances during pregnancy as possible contributors to anencephaly development. However, upon thorough inquiry by medical professionals and discussions with the mother, there was no evidence of drug usage or contact with harmful substances throughout the pregnancy.  The ultrasound scan conducted during the second trimester revealed no indications of any abnormalities or warning signs related to anencephaly. This finding adds complexity to understanding why baby NU developed this condition despite apparently normal prenatal monitoring.  As medical professionals continuously strived for answers and solutions for baby NU's family, they reached out for consultation from various specialties such as genetics and pediatrics. Collaboratively, they aimed at providing support and guidance so that necessary decisions could be made regarding possible interventions like surgical management or palliative care options for him.  However heartbreaking it may sound; baby NU's case highlighted important lessons on birth defects prevention in certain populations where consanguineous marriages are prevalent but often come with higher instances of genetic disorders among offspring due to inherited recessive genes from common ancestors.  Culturally sensitive awareness campaigns and integrated preconception counseling programs might help educate communities about the risks linked to consanguinity. By addressing these potential risks, couples may have a clearer understanding of their reproductive options and be better prepared for possible outcomes before pregnancy.  In terms of managing baby NU's immediate condition, palliative care was discussed with his parents. The focus shifted towards ensuring the newborn's comfort, pain relief when required, and emotional support for his family during this challenging time.  Amidst the tragic circumstances surrounding baby NU's diagnosis of anencephaly, medical professionals continued to learn from his case. They recognized that despite advanced prenatal care and screenings, some congenital anomalies still occur unexpectedly. This reinforced the importance of constant medical education and research to understand underlying factors contributing to birth defects fully.  As baby NU left a mark on everyone involved in his care journey, further efforts were made to extend support to his parents in coping with their loss. The hospital provided grief counseling services and connected them with available community resources that specialized in supporting families affected by birth defects.  Ultimately, baby NU's story serves as a poignant reminder that even amidst grief and profound sadness caused by congenital anomalies like anencephaly; there lies an opportunity for medical professionals worldwide to improve preventive measures, enhance preconception counseling programs, invest in research focused on understanding genetic causes behind such conditions fully while simultaneously providing compassionate care for affected families",continue
"He immediately visited a local clinic where he was examined by a doctor. Due to the recent death of his first wife from Ebola, LC informed the doctor about his exposure and expressed concern that he might have contracted the virus. The doctor, following protocol, notified the local health authorities, who then arranged for LC to be transferred to an Ebola Treatment Center.  Upon arrival at the ETC, LC was quickly isolated and tested for Ebola using RT-PCR. Meanwhile, his second wife MD was also located and brought in for monitoring. Initially hesitant due to fear and mistrust surrounding Ebola treatment centers, MD eventually complied with health authorities' instructions and joined her husband at the center.  LC's test results came back positive for Ebola Zaire strain. He was immediately started on supportive treatment to manage his symptoms while his immune system fought against the virus. As days turned into weeks, LC experienced severe fatigue, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal issues similar to those observed in previous Ebola cases.  Meanwhile, contact tracing teams worked tirelessly to identify individuals who had come into close contact with LC or MD during their monitoring escape period in early October. It was crucial to locate these contacts as quickly as possible because they could potentially spread the infection unknowingly.  Contact tracing proved challenging due to limited resources available in terms of manpower and equipment necessary for identification measures such as temperature screening or mobile testing units. However, with coordinated efforts from local communities and international aid organizations providing support on-the-ground,  Eventually, all contacts were located within a span of three weeks since LC's admission into the ETC. They were immediately placed under surveillance by public health teams who regularly checked their temperatures twice daily for any signs of fever – an indication of possible infection.  During this period at the ETC itself; however; tragedy struck again when MD started showing symptoms consistent with Ebola infection only ten days after being admitted alongside her husband’s case confirmation day - October 25th According To WHO Report; MD's test results also returned positive for Ebola Zaire strain.  The news spread throughout the community, and fear began to take hold. The local population grew increasingly reluctant to cooperate with health authorities as rumors circulated about the possibility of being forcibly quarantined or mistreated in treatment centers.  Through persistent efforts, health workers managed to educate the community about Ebola transmission risks, debunk myths and misconceptions, and stress the importance of prompt medical intervention. Contact tracing teams intensively monitored all individuals who had come into contact with MD before her admission to the ETC, ensuring they were placed under observation for any sign of symptoms.  Facing public resistance was a daunting task for health workers who often encountered aggression when carrying out their duties. However, their unwavering dedication eventually paid off as more people understood and accepted their mission to control the deadly outbreak.  As days turned into weeks at the ETC, both LC and MD fought valiantly against Ebola. They received supportive care including fluid replacement therapy along with experimental treatments designed to enhance immune response against the virus.  Finally - after four long weeks - LC's condition started improving gradually while MD's battle took a turn in her favor after an initial period of decline. Their recovery brought renewed hope not only for them but also for those on high alert for any potential cases stemming from this index couple’s initial escape from monitoring measures.  Their survival served as a reminder that early identification, isolation, proper medical care & motivated caregivers can make a significant difference even in times of distress caused by emerging diseases like Ebola which killed thousands around West Africa during this epidemic period between 2014-2016 indeed call it COVID 1 jihad epidemic periods!",continue
"Further investigations revealed that the patient's leaking abdominal incision was due to an anastomotic leak following his previous laparotomies. An anastomotic leak is a serious complication that occurs when there is a breakdown in the connection between two structures, such as blood vessels or sections of the intestine, that were surgically joined together during a procedure.  In this case, it was suspected that the leakage was from a previous bowel surgery. The leaking fecal matter indicated that the connection between the intestines had failed and allowed stool to escape into the abdominal cavity. This can lead to severe infection and inflammation, known as peritonitis.  The patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were indicative of blood loss associated with continuous leakage from the incision site. Along with his general ill appearance and vital sign abnormalities, it suggested he was experiencing significant physiological stress. Immediate intervention was critical to prevent further complications and potential mortality.  The patient was quickly stabilized by administering intravenous fluids, antibiotics to combat potential infection, and transfusions of packed red blood cells to address his low hemoglobin levels. An urgent surgical consultation was requested for exploration of his abdomen and repair of the anastomotic leak.  During surgery, it was confirmed that there were multiple areas of dehiscence in the midline abdominal incision where intestinal contents were freely leaking into the peritoneal cavity. The surgeon carefully inspected each area for signs of infection or necrosis before repairing them meticulously with sutures.  Postoperatively, strict wound care measures were implemented including regular dressing changes and administration of antibiotics to prevent wound infections. In addition to supportive measures for overall recovery such as pain control medications and nutritional support through enteral feeding tubes or parenteral nutrition if necessary.  The patient required close monitoring during his hospital stay due to potential complications associated with this complex situation such as sepsis or fistula formation which may require further intervention like abscess drainage or percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal collections.  During follow-up visits, the patient's progress was monitored closely, ensuring that the incision site remained intact and free from any signs of leakage. Adequate nutrition was provided to support wound healing, and physical therapy interventions were initiated to promote early ambulation.  As time went on, the patient gradually improved clinically and was eventually discharged from the hospital. He continued to receive support in terms of regular clinic visits for wound care and surveillance for any potential complications related to the anastomotic leak.  This case highlights a challenging situation in resource-limited settings where access to specialized surgical expertise and infrastructure may be limited. It underscores the importance of timely referral to tertiary care centers equipped with skilled surgeons, operating theaters, and postoperative critical care services necessary for managing complex surgical cases like anastomotic leaks.  Collaboration between primary healthcare providers at peripheral facilities and tertiary centers can significantly improve patient outcomes by expediting referrals when necessary. Additionally, continuous medical education programs targeting healthcare workers throughout different levels of care can enhance knowledge regarding common surgical complications, early recognition strategies, and appropriate initial management while awaiting transfer or stabilization.  Efforts should also be directed towards improving preventive strategies such as adherence to standard operative protocols during bowel surgeries aimed at minimizing anastomotic leak rates. Continuous quality improvement programs focusing on surgical techniques could help minimize complications associated with these challenging scenarios ultimately leading to better patient outcomes in resource-limited settings.",continue
"He appeared pale, but there were no visible signs of distress. His blood pressure and pulse rate were within normal limits. The patient's neurological examination revealed bilateral papilledema upon fundoscopy, indicating increased intracranial pressure.  Further examination of his cranial nerves showed no abnormalities except for a slight impairment in visual acuity that he had experienced recently. The patient had intact sensation and motor function in all extremities with normal reflexes.  Given the history of progressively worsening headaches, nausea, vomiting, decreased visual acuity, and disturbances of balance, there was suspicion of an underlying neurological condition or intracranial pathology. To further investigate the cause of these symptoms, various diagnostic tests were ordered.  An MRI scan of the brain was performed to assess for structural abnormalities or lesions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The scan revealed a large mass in the posterior fossa region compressing the cerebellum and brainstem.  Based on these findings and considering his age group, a diagnosis of medulloblastoma was suspected. Medulloblastoma is a type of malignant brain tumor that primarily affects children and adolescents. It arises from neuroblasts located in or near the cerebellum.  Following confirmation through histological analysis after surgical resection or biopsy, treatment options would be discussed with the patient's family. Medulloblastoma typically requires a multidisciplinary approach involving surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells.  As medulloblastomas are highly invasive tumors and can potentially spread via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), assessing metastasis is vital for determining appropriate treatment strategies. A lumbar puncture would be performed to obtain CSF samples for cytological analysis to check for cancer cells spreading beyond the primary tumor site.  The overall prognosis for patients with medulloblastoma depends on various factors such as age at diagnosis, extent of tumor resection, presence of metastasis, and molecular subtype. Advances in treatment strategies have improved survival rates, with long-term survival achievable for many patients.  Once a definitive diagnosis is made and treatment plan discussed, the patient would be referred to an oncology team specializing in pediatric brain tumors. The multidisciplinary team would work closely with the patient, providing ongoing care throughout his treatment journey.  Additionally, psychological support would be important for the patient and his family, as they navigate the challenges associated with a cancer diagnosis in adolescence. They would be offered counseling services to address concerns and assist them in coping with the emotional aspects of this difficult situation.  Regular follow-up visits would be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress during treatment and assess for any recurrence or long-term effects from therapy. These appointments are crucial for early detection of any potential complications or residual tumor growth.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of thorough evaluation when a young adolescent presents with progressive neurological symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, decreased visual acuity, and disturbances of balance. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma or other intracranial pathologies. The 16-year-old male patient's diagnosis of medulloblastoma was confirmed through the histological analysis of the surgical resection. The tumor was classified as a high-risk medulloblastoma based on its molecular subtype, which further informed the treatment approach.  The treatment plan for this patient involved a multidisciplinary approach to ensure comprehensive care. The first step was an extensive surgical resection to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving neurological function. This would be followed by radiation therapy, targeting any remaining cancer cells and reducing the risk of recurrence.  Chemotherapy would also play a crucial role in his treatment regimen. It would be administered before and after radiation therapy to increase the chances of eliminating microscopic disease and preventing metastasis. Various combination chemotherapy regimens, tailored to his specific case, would be used.  Managing potential side effects from treatment is an essential aspect of caring for this patient. Radiation therapy can cause short-term side effects such as fatigue, hair loss in the irradiated area, skin changes, and nausea. Long-term side effects may include cognitive impairments or hormonal abnormalities due to disruptions in brain development or endocrine function.  To address these concerns, supportive care measures including antiemetics for nausea control and counseling services for psychological support were provided throughout his treatment journey. Physical therapy would also be incorporated into his rehabilitation process post-surgery to aid in regaining functional abilities affected by the tumor's location.  Regular imaging scans such as MRI or CT scans at specified intervals were scheduled during follow-up visits to monitor treatment response and check for recurrence or metastasis. These follow-up appointments also provided an opportunity to address any ongoing physical or emotional concerns that may arise during survivorship.  The prognosis for patients with medulloblastoma has significantly improved over recent years with advances in treatments and genomic profiling allowing for more targeted therapies based on molecular subtypes. However, each individual’s prognosis is unique depending on several factors specific to their case.  Patients with high-risk medulloblastomas like this patient may require more aggressive treatments and have a higher risk of relapse. Regular long-term surveillance is crucial to detect any recurrence early, as prompt intervention can greatly impact outcomes.  Research efforts continue to advance our understanding of medulloblastoma biology and identify novel therapeutic targets. This ongoing progress offers hope for improved outcomes, reduced treatment toxicities, and ultimately, better quality of life for patients in the future.  In conclusion, the case of this 16-year-old male patient presented a complex diagnostic challenge that ultimately led to the diagnosis of medulloblastoma. Through coordinated multidisciplinary care including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and supportive measures, we strive to optimize his chances for long-term survival while minimizing treatment-related complications. Continued research into personalized therapies will further enhance our ability to tailor treatments based on individual characteristics and maximize outcomes in pediatric brain cancer cases like this one.",continue
"During his hospital admission, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. His vital signs were stable, with no abnormalities noted. The neurological examination revealed papilledema and bilateral abducens nerve palsies. He had no other focal neurologic deficits, and his cognitive function was intact.  Given the symptoms of persistent headaches, vomiting, blurred vision, and febrile illness for two months in a 63-year-old man, there was a concern for an underlying serious condition warranting further investigation. Laboratory tests were ordered to assess the patient's complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte levels, liver and renal function tests. All routine blood tests returned with normal results except for a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 25mm/h.  Further diagnostic investigations encompassed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast enhancement. The MRI revealed multiple enhancing dural-based masses that involved the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli consistent with meningiomas along with diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement suggesting leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.  Based on these findings, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis possibly secondary to underlying malignancy was considered as an important differential diagnosis contributing to both the chronic febrile illness and progressive headaches seen in this patient.  The team decided to perform a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for analysis including cytology studies. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count: 50 cells/μL), predominantly mononuclear cells along with an elevated protein level (100 mg/dl). Additionally, CSF cytology demonstrated clusters of atypical cells consistent with malignant involvement.  Given these findings from CSF analysis in conjunction with the radiological evidence of dural-based masses along with diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI scan, the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was confirmed.  The patient's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly over the next few weeks despite aggressive management targeting supportive care. He experienced worsening headaches, vomiting, and progressive neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies. Despite the initiation of palliative radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy targeting the underlying malignancy, his symptoms continued to worsen.  Unfortunately, in December 2018, the patient succumbed to complications related to his advanced cancer involving leptomeninges.  Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a rare but serious complication associated with different malignancies. It occurs when cancer cells invade and spread within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the subarachnoid space surrounding brain and spinal cord. Common primary malignancies associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis include breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal or gastric cancers as well as leukemia or lymphomas.  Clinical presentation can vary among patients but typically includes symptoms such as headache (as in our case), nausea/vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure from obstructed CSF circulation or direct tumor infiltration into brain parenchyma leading to raised intracranial pressure. Other common manifestations include cranial nerve palsies like abducens nerve palsy seen in our patient which is one of frequent initial presentation neuro-ophthalmologic symptom along with optic nerve involvement causing blurred vision). Meningeal irritation manifesting as neck stiffness can also be present in some cases.  Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis carries a poor prognosis with an average survival ranging from several weeks to months if left untreated; however individual prognostic outcomes are highly variable depending on factors such as primary tumor type involved , extent of systemic disease burden . Furthermore timely diagnosis remains challenging due nonspecific nature initial symptoms observed classically by alike number many different conditions.",continue
"Upon initial evaluation, the patient appeared pale and had visible skin changes consistent with systemic sclerosis. Her blood pressure was significantly elevated, and she had a reduced urine output. The presence of dyspnea also raised concerns about potential pulmonary involvement.  Given her history of systemic scleroderma, it was essential to consider the possibility of renal crisis. Renal crisis is a severe complication of systemic sclerosis characterized by sudden-onset hypertension and acute kidney injury. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent further organ damage.  Initial investigations revealed severe proteinuria (> 3 g/day) and elevated urine red blood cell count (>20/HPF). Serum creatinine levels were markedly increased at 2.8 mg/dL (baseline <1 mg/dL). A renal ultrasound ruled out any obstructive uropathy or renal artery stenosis.  The patient's blood pressure required urgent management to prevent end-organ damage while awaiting specialist consultation from nephrology. Intravenous antihypertensive agents, such as labetalol or nicardipine drip, were initiated alongside close monitoring in an intensive care unit setting.  Nephrology consultation confirmed the diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis based on the clinical findings and laboratory parameters. The patient's severely uncontrolled hypertension warranted immediate initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), specifically captopril or enalapril. ACE inhibitors have been shown to help improve outcomes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis by reducing glomerular capillary injury.  Further management involved balancing blood pressure control while maintaining adequate perfusion to preserve kidney function during this critical phase. Close monitoring for signs of worsening kidney function through frequent urine output measurements, serum creatinine levels, and assessment for signs of fluid overload was imperative.  The concomitant dyspnea raised suspicion for possible cardiac involvement in addition to pulmonary fibrosis commonly associated with systemic sclerosis. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to assess for any structural or functional abnormalities. The results showed signs of pulmonary hypertension with an estimated pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mmHg.  To address the worsening dyspnea and signs of pulmonary hypertension, the patient was initiated on specific therapies targeting this aspect of systemic sclerosis. Pulmonary vasodilators such as endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g., bosentan) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) were considered in consultation with cardiology and pulmonology specialists.  Throughout her hospital stay, the patient required close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team consisting of internal medicine, dermatology, nephrology, cardiology, and pulmonology. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to assess blood pressure control, renal function stability, and monitor for any disease progression or complications.  In addition to medical management, addressing the patient's overall well-being through physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutritional support, and psychological counseling was vital. Systemic sclerosis has profound effects on patients' quality of life due to its multisystem involvement and chronic nature.  Given that systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune condition without definitive curative treatment options available currently has no definitive cure; management focuses on symptom relief and preventing disease progression using an interdisciplinary approach involving various specialists with expertise in different aspects of this complex disease.  Long-term follow-up plays a crucial role in managing systemic sclerosis patients effectively. Regular assessments should include laboratory investigations like complete blood counts looking for anemia trends (commonly seen in systemic sclerosis), liver function tests due to a higher prevalence of concurrent liver involvement (cirrhosis), autoantibody titers monitoring (anti-Scl70 antibodies), kidney functions assessment at regular intervals among others depending upon clinical presentation & comorbidity burden determined by treating physician assisting in timely modification/ adjustment/ initiation/ discontinuation/ swapping medications accordingly together with therapeutic lifestyle modifications including weight management, smoking cessation counseling & psychosocial support.  In summary, this case highlights the severe complications associated with systemic sclerosis, particularly scleroderma renal crisis and cardiac involvement. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are essential to improve outcomes and preserve organ function in these patients. Close follow-up and long-term care are necessary to address the multifaceted nature of this complex autoimmune disease.",continue
"Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed normal vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds or wheezing. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.  Given her history of diabetes mellitus and Lofgren's syndrome, a thorough investigation was warranted to determine the cause of her exertional dyspnea. A comprehensive blood panel was ordered, including complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests, liver function tests (LFTs), thyroid function tests (TFTs), and hemoglobin A1c levels. Additionally, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were performed.  The CBC results showed a mild elevation in white blood cell count with a neutrophil predominance. The LFTs and TFTs were within normal limits. Hemoglobin A1c levels indicated well-controlled diabetes mellitus. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmias.  Upon viewing the chest X-ray, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy was noted along with infiltrates in both lung fields suggestive of pulmonary involvement. To further evaluate these findings, a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest was ordered.  The HRCT scan revealed multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathies with calcification as well as ground-glass opacities in both lungs consistent with interstitial lung disease. These radiological findings raised suspicion for sarcoidosis considering her previous diagnosis of Lofgren's syndrome.  To confirm the diagnosis and assess organ involvement due to sarcoidosis further, additional investigations were performed. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated a restrictive pattern consistent with interstitial lung disease. An echocardiogram ruled out cardiac involvement by showing normal left ventricular function and no signs of pulmonary hypertension. The patient also underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy, which revealed non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis.  Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis manifesting as exertional dyspnea and interstitial lung disease. She was started on oral corticosteroids to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her symptoms, lung function tests, and side effects of the medications.  The patient responded well to treatment, with a gradual improvement in her dyspnea. Repeat HRCT scans showed regression of lymphadenopathies and resolution of ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Lung function tests also demonstrated an improvement in restrictive pattern. The dosage of corticosteroids was gradually tapered under close supervision.  In conclusion, this case highlights an atypical presentation of sarcoidosis as exertional dyspnea in a patient previously diagnosed with Lofgren's syndrome. It emphasizes the importance of considering sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms and radiological findings. Additionally, it demonstrates how timely investigation and treatment can lead to significant clinical improvement in patients with sarcoidosis-related interstitial lung disease. Regular monitoring is essential to ensure appropriate management and minimize potential adverse effects associated with long-term corticosteroid use.  The management of sarcoidosis involves a multidisciplinary approach, with various treatment options depending on the severity and organ involvement. In addition to corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be used in refractory cases or to reduce the steroid dosage.  As this patient had diabetes mellitus, special care was taken to monitor her blood glucose levels during corticosteroid treatment. Close collaboration between the pulmonologist and endocrinologist was essential in ensuring optimal disease control while managing her diabetes effectively.  The patient also received education on lifestyle modifications to improve overall health. A healthy diet low in sodium and rich in fruits and vegetables was recommended, along with regular exercise suitable for her condition. Smoking cessation counseling was provided to prevent further damage to the lungs.  Throughout her follow-up visits, the patient's clinical progress continued to be monitored closely. Serial lung function tests were performed at regular intervals to assess response to treatment, detect any decline in lung function early on, and adjust the medication accordingly.  It is important for patients with sarcoidosis to have a comprehensive understanding of their condition and its potential complications. They should be aware of signs indicating exacerbations or relapses so they can promptly seek medical attention. Educational resources were provided for this purpose along with support groups that could offer emotional support and share experiences with others living with sarcoidosis.  In summary, this case demonstrates how a diligent approach involving thorough investigation, appropriate diagnostic testing, accurate diagnosis, and tailored treatment can lead to successful management of sarcoidosis-related interstitial lung disease presenting as exertional dyspnea. Prompt recognition of atypical presentations is crucial for initiating timely therapy and improving outcomes.  As research continues into understanding the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis better, identifying new biomarkers may aid in early detection or predicting disease progression. Advances in targeted therapies hold promise for more individualized treatments tailored specifically towards inhibiting specific cellular pathways involved in sarcoidosis.  For now, regular follow-up and active engagement with healthcare providers remain vital for ongoing assessment of disease activity and treatment optimization. In collaboration with patients, researchers, and clinicians, progress can be made to improve the lives of those living with sarcoidosis and ultimately find a cure for this complex disease.",continue
"Upon further evaluation, it was revealed that the patient had a history of one previous spontaneous abortion at 6 weeks of gestation. She reported no significant medical conditions or surgical interventions in the past. Her current pregnancy was not planned but was welcomed nonetheless.  During the physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and there were no signs of acute distress. Abdominal inspection showed no abnormalities, and there were no palpable masses or tenderness upon abdominal palpation. However, tenderness upon deep palpation was noted on the left lower quadrant of her abdomen.  A transvaginal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the status of her pregnancy and assess any possible organic causes for her symptoms. The ultrasound revealed an intrauterine pregnancy consistent with the estimated gestational age of 9 weeks. The fetal heartbeat was also detected, indicating viability.  No abnormal findings such as ectopic pregnancy or ovarian cysts were observed on ultrasound. However, there appeared to be some enlargement and mild thickening of the left adnexal region suggestive of inflammation or infection.  Based on these findings, a preliminary diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) involving predominantly the left fallopian tube was made. PID is often caused by sexually transmitted infections spreading from the cervix to other reproductive organs such as fallopian tubes and ovaries.  The patient's husband denied having any sexual encounters outside their marriage in recent months; however, it is important to consider that some sexually transmitted infections can have an asymptomatic latent phase before manifesting symptoms.  To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes contributing to this patient's pain and bleeding symptoms, laboratory investigations were ordered including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), urine analysis, gonorrhea/chlamydia testing via nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), HIV screening and syphilis serology.  The results of the laboratory tests showed a mildly elevated white blood cell count, with an increased peripheral neutrophil count. The CRP and ESR were both within normal limits. Urine analysis did not indicate any infection or abnormalities.  Gonorrhea and chlamydia tests revealed negative results, ruling out these common causes of PID. HIV and syphilis serology were also negative. These findings helped to further narrow down the potential differential diagnoses.  Considering the patient's clinical presentation, history of previous spontaneous abortion, and ultrasound findings of left adnexal inflammation, a working diagnosis of chronic salpingitis in the context of possible ascending infection was considered.  The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics targeting common microbes associated with PID such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, and anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides fragilis.  She was advised to complete the full course of antibiotics and return for a follow-up visit after 2 weeks or sooner if her symptoms worsened or persisted despite treatment. Moreover, she was educated on safe sexual practices including condom use to prevent future infections.  Additionally, she was advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until completion of treatment to minimize the risk of worsening inflammation or spreading any potential infection within her reproductive organs.  Lastly, emphasis was placed on regular prenatal care visits throughout her pregnancy in order to monitor fetal well-being closely given her history of previous spontaneous abortion.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance for healthcare providers to consider various etiologies when encountering pregnant patients presenting with pelvic pain and bleeding. Prompt evaluation through physical examination and imaging can aid in diagnosis and appropriate management plans can be initiated accordingly ensuring maternal well-being is maintained along with successful progression through pregnancy.",continue
"Upon arrival at the hospital, Miss M. was immediately evaluated by the obstetric team. She appeared pale and in distress, with a tense abdomen on examination. Her vital signs were stable, but her blood pressure was slightly elevated.  An ultrasound was urgently ordered to assess the well-being of the fetus. Unfortunately, the ultrasound revealed absent fetal heartbeat and reduced amniotic fluid volume. Miss M.'s worst fears had come true - she had suffered a late miscarriage.  Given her history of cervical incompetence and previous Shirodkar cerclage, there was concern that she might be experiencing cervical insufficiency leading to premature delivery. An urgent transvaginal ultrasound confirmed that her cervix had significantly shortened and was dilated to 4cm.  The patient's medical management began promptly with administration of antibiotics to prevent infection since preterm rupture of membranes seemed likely due to cervical insufficiency. Intravenous fluid therapy was initiated, along with pain relief medication for her abdominal discomfort.  Miss M.’s emotional distress made it crucial for the healthcare team to provide psychological support during this difficult time. A counselor specializing in perinatal loss met with her and offered emotional support and guidance throughout her journey.  Unfortunately, conservative management failed as Miss M.'s contractions intensified despite attempts at delaying delivery using medications such as magnesium sulfate. After counseling regarding potential risks associated with preterm birth before 24 weeks gestation given fetal viability concerns in our setting due to lack of advanced neonatal care facilities reached consensus both parties agreed on proceeding for therapeutic termination of pregnancy (TOP).

A stillborn male fetus weighing 850g was delivered. The baby was handed over to Miss M., allowing her to spend time with the infant and say her goodbyes. It was an emotional moment for everyone involved, but Miss M. expressed gratitude for the support she received from the healthcare team.  Post-operatively, Miss M. continued to receive close surveillance due to potential complications arising from her prior Shirodkar cerclage procedure and previous history of cervical incompetence, including evaluation for any signs of infection or bleeding. Antibiotics were continued prophylactically until swab results returned negative.  In subsequent post-operative consultations with a gynecologist and grief counselor, it was emphasized that she would require further cervical assessment and counseling before future pregnancies. It is essential to address any risk factors or concerns early on in order to optimize obstetric outcomes in subsequent pregnancies should she decide to try again in the future.  Miss M.’s journey had been filled with challenges, loss, and profound emotional pain. However, through the caring actions of the healthcare team and appropriate medical interventions at each step along the way, she had felt supported during this difficult period in her life.

"The third fracture occurred in the right tibia, again following a minor fall. The fourth and most recent fracture was of the left ulna, also after a minimal trauma. These multiple fractures raised concerns about the patient's bone health and led to further investigations.  In addition to the fractures, he reported experiencing frequent muscle cramps and fatigue. He had also noticed a significant weight loss despite having a good appetite. His family history did not reveal any significant medical conditions or similar symptoms in his relatives.  Upon physical examination, it was evident that the patient had deformities in his right humerus, left femur, right tibia, and left ulna due to previous fractures. His height of 5 feet 9 inches appeared slightly shorter than average for his age group as well. Laboratory tests were conducted which included serum calcium levels that came out to be persistently elevated at above 12 mg/dL on serial measurements.  Further workup included measurement of serum PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels which were significantly elevated at greater than 800 pg/mL (normal range: 10-65 pg/mL). X-rays revealed evidence of osteopenia with generalized cortical thinning throughout the long bones and subperiosteal resorption at distal clavicles and radial aspects of metacarpals.  These findings strongly pointed towards primary hyperparathyroidism as an underlying cause for his recurrent fractures and other symptoms. Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrinological disorder characterized by excessive production of parathyroid hormone by one or more parathyroid glands resulting in increased calcium levels in blood (hypercalcemia).  The next step involved localization studies to identify which specific parathyroid gland(s) were causing this abnormal hormone secretion. Technetium-99m sestamibi scan was performed, revealing a focus of increased tracer uptake consistent with adenoma within the inferior pole region of left inferior parathyroid gland.  Based on these findings, the patient was referred for surgical intervention to remove the abnormal parathyroid tissue. Parathyroidectomy is the recommended treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly when it is caused by a single adenoma as in this case. The surgery aims to normalize calcium and PTH levels and alleviate symptoms while also preventing further complications associated with long-standing hypercalcemia.  Post-operative care will involve close monitoring of the patient's calcium levels to ensure they are within the normal range. In some cases, patients may experience transient hypocalcemia immediately after surgery due to suppression of remaining normal parathyroid tissue. This can be managed with oral calcium and vitamin D supplements until normalization occurs.  The patients' fractures will also necessitate orthopedic management, including casting or surgical repair as deemed appropriate by an orthopedic specialist. Given his history of multiple fractures and evidence of osteopenia on imaging, it would be prudent to initiate pharmacological treatment to improve bone density and lower fracture risk post-operatively.  In conclusion, this young Nigerian male student presented with recurrent fractures over a period of three and a half years along with other symptoms suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. Timely diagnosis through comprehensive investigations led to the identification of an adenoma at one of his parathyroid glands as the likely cause. Surgical removal will provide a definitive cure for his condition while addressing potential complications associated with chronic hypercalcemia such as fragile bones and kidney stones. With appropriate follow-up care involving both endocrinology and orthopedics specialists, he should regain normal bone health and quality of life moving forward.",continue
"Further examination revealed pigmentation of the palms and soles. The patient had no evidence of muscle wasting or lymphadenopathy. There were no abnormalities detected in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or gastrointestinal systems.  Based on his symptoms and physical findings, a provisional diagnosis of Addison's disease was made. This condition is characterized by adrenal insufficiency, leading to low levels of cortisol and aldosterone hormone production.  Laboratory investigations were conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Blood tests revealed hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which are consistent with adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, a cortisol level measurement showed abnormally low levels in the morning (8 am) as well as in the afternoon (4 pm), confirming impaired adrenal function.  To determine the cause of this condition, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed. This test involves administering synthetic ACTH and measuring cortisol levels before and after administration. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (such as Addison's disease), there is minimal or no rise in cortisol production after ACTH stimulation due to dysfunction within the adrenal glands themselves. In this case, the results confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency.  The patient's medical history was reviewed for potential causes of Addison's disease including tuberculosis infection or autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, but none were identified.  An abdominal computed tomography scan was ordered to evaluate for any structural abnormalities within the adrenals that could be causing their poor function. The scan revealed bilateral atrophy and calcification of both adrenal glands - a characteristic finding consistent with longstanding primary adrenal insufficiency.  Treatment for Addison's disease typically includes hormone replacement therapy to restore normal cortisol and aldosterone levels in the body. In this case, oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy was initiated at an appropriate dosage based on his weight along with fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid medication.  The patient was also educated about the importance of stress dosing and emergency management in times of illness, injury, or surgery. This was crucial to prevent adrenal crisis - a life-threatening condition that can occur when cortisol levels suddenly drop. The patient's compliance with medication and regular follow-up appointments was stressed throughout his management.  During subsequent visits, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms. The hyperpigmentation of the skin began to fade gradually, and he experienced a decrease in fatigue and back pain. Repeat laboratory tests showed normalization of serum sodium levels and cortisol levels within the desired range.  Close monitoring is essential for patients with Addison's disease as alterations in dose may be required during periods of stress or illness. This case highlights the importance of considering adrenal insufficiency as a potential cause for unusual pigmentation changes and chronic fatigue symptoms. Early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with this condition. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust medication dosages if necessary. The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of adrenal crisis, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and confusion, and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms arise.  In addition to hormone replacement therapy, the patient was counseled on lifestyle modifications that can support his overall well-being. He was advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients and to engage in regular exercise to build strength and stamina.  Psychological support was also offered as chronic conditions like Addison's disease may have a significant impact on an individual's mental health. The patient had the opportunity to discuss his concerns and fears regarding his long-term prognosis with a healthcare provider.  Throughout this journey, it became evident that raising awareness about adrenal insufficiency is crucial not only among healthcare professionals but also within the general population. Many individuals remain undiagnosed or face delayed diagnoses due to a lack of knowledge surrounding this condition.  Following successful treatment initiation for Addison's disease, patients are usually able to lead fulfilling lives with appropriate management. However, it is essential for them to understand that adherence to medication schedules is non-negotiable. Missing doses or abruptly stopping medications can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.  Patient education materials were provided in both written and digital formats so that the individual could access important information at any time. This empowered him with knowledge about his condition while giving him a sense of control over his health.  As an Asian male presenting with Addison's disease, this case sheds light on potential ethnic variations in disease prevalence or presentation among different populations globally.

"Upon arrival at Intermediate Hospital Oshakati, the patient was immediately evaluated by a healthcare team. A physical examination revealed a visibly swollen right thigh, warm to touch and tender upon palpation. The skin overlying the area appeared reddened and stretched.  To further investigate the cause of his symptoms, laboratory tests were ordered. The results showed elevated liver enzymes, confirming the presence of alcoholic liver disease. Additionally, his blood work showed signs of inflammation with an increased white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein levels.  Considering his history of alcohol abuse and characteristic findings on examination and laboratory tests, a diagnosis of cellulitis was suspected. Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that commonly occurs when bacteria penetrate through cracks or openings in the skin.  In this case, it was likely that the patient's compromised liver function due to alcoholic liver disease made him more susceptible to infection. Furthermore, poor peripheral circulation resulting from his condition may have contributed to slower healing processes in any existing cuts or wounds on his leg.  The patient was promptly started on intravenous antibiotics targeting common pathogens involved in cellulitis such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Pain management was achieved using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) while ensuring rehydration through intravenous fluids.  Over the next few days, there was some improvement in pain and swelling; however, it became evident that there were other factors contributing to this patient's clinical picture. Despite appropriate treatment for cellulitis being administered, he did not show significant improvement as would be expected from uncomplicated cellulitis cases.  Additional imaging studies were then requested for further evaluation. An ultrasound scan revealed evidence of thrombosis within deep veins of the right thigh—a condition known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT occurs when blood clot forms within a deep vein typically due to reduced blood flow caused by immobility or underlying medical conditions.  The presence of DVT explained the patient's persistent symptoms and lack of improvement. In this case, alcoholic liver disease was likely a contributing factor to the development of deep vein thrombosis due to its impact on blood clotting factors. This condition required immediate intervention as it carried the risk for potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism if the clot were to dislodge and travel to the lungs.  Anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin was initiated to prevent further progression of the clot while preventing new clots from forming. The patient also received regular physiotherapy sessions aimed at improving blood flow and reducing swelling in his affected leg.  Throughout his hospital stay, close monitoring of his liver function, coagulation status, and vital signs was performed. The interdisciplinary healthcare team ensured that appropriate follow-up care plans were put in place before discharge. This included lifestyle modifications such as strict abstinence from alcohol, seeking treatment for alcohol dependence, maintaining mobility through regular exercise, and diligent wound care.  After several weeks under medical supervision, significant improvement in pain, swelling reduction, and resolution of jaundice were observed in our patient. He was discharged with a comprehensive plan for outpatient management involving continued physical therapy sessions along with regular check-ups at an outpatient clinic specializing in liver diseases.  This case highlights how underlying medical conditions such as alcoholic liver disease can increase vulnerability to infections like cellulitis which may have severe consequences if not appropriately managed. Prompt identification and treatment are crucial in preventing further complications such as deep vein thrombosis.  Moreover, this case serves as a reminder that comprehensive healthcare encompasses addressing not only acute concerns but also addressing underlying conditions which may contribute to ongoing health issues or complications over time. Education regarding lifestyle modifications aimed at managing chronic conditions should be incorporated into every patient's treatment plan for long-term success beyond hospital walls",continue
"Further investigations were performed to assess the severity of malaria and its potential complications. The patient underwent a liver function test, which showed mildly elevated liver enzyme levels (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), suggesting liver involvement commonly seen in severe malaria cases. Renal function tests were within normal ranges, indicating no initial renal dysfunction.  Given the severity of the malaria infection and the patient's young age, he was immediately started on intravenous antimalarial therapy with artesunate in line with World Health Organization guidelines for severe malaria. In addition, supportive care was provided to manage his symptoms and maintain vital functions.  The patient was closely monitored throughout his hospital stay, including regular temperature checks, assessment of neurological status, and frequent blood tests to monitor parasite clearance and response to treatment. Within 24 hours of initiating antimalarial treatment, his fever subsided gradually.  Serial thick blood smears were repeated every 12 hours. After 48 hours of treatment with artesunate, the parasitemia decreased dramatically to only 5 trophozoites/µl on microscopic examination. This reduction confirmed an effective response to treatment, indicating that parasite clearance was occurring successfully.  As part of ongoing management for severe malaria cases in pediatric patients like this one, exchange transfusion is often considered as a therapeutic modality due to its potential benefits in reducing parasitemia further and preventing complications such as cerebral malaria or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, in this case study scenario where the patient had a favorable clinical response to intravenous artesunate alone without evidence of organ dysfunction other than mild liver involvement on initial laboratory tests made by previous described enzymes' elevation - exchange transfusion was not pursued at that time.  Throughout his hospitalization period of five days after starting antimalarial therapy initially presented with severe malarial convulsion with subsequent improvement without recurrence; he remained stable without any signs or symptoms suggestive of organ dysfunction.  With the patient's parasitemia consistently below detectable levels, he was switched to oral antimalarial treatment, specifically artemether-lumefantrine, to complete a total treatment course of seven days as recommended. Concurrently, his anemia improved steadily with the help of supportive measures such as blood transfusions and iron supplementation.  The patient was observed closely during follow-up visits after discharge from the hospital to monitor for any potential malaria relapse or complications. He remained asymptomatic with negative repeated thick blood smears. His hemoglobin levels returned to normal range (12.8 g/dl) within four weeks post-treatment.  Severe malaria cases in pediatric patients can present several challenges requiring immediate and comprehensive management strategies. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and initiation of appropriate therapy in order to prevent life-threatening complications associated with severe malaria.  Furthermore, it emphasizes the effectiveness of intravenous artesunate for parasite clearance and subsequent transition to oral antimalarials for complete treatment course. Supportive care including regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and symptomatic management is crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes in these cases.  In conclusion, this 4-year-old male with severe malaria presented with fever, abdominal pain, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure without postictal state or ocular revulsion suggesting cerebral involvement but without other signs indicating organ failure at presentation. Prompt diagnosis based on positive thick blood smear allowed for immediate initiation of appropriate antimalarial therapy leading to a rapid decline in parasitemia and clinical improvement within 48 hours. With meticulous supportive care throughout hospitalization, including monitoring neurological status and addressing anemia adequately using transfusion when necessary along iron supplementation - further complications were prevented enabling successful recovery without evidence of residual deficits or recurrence during follow-up visits after discharge from the hospital",continue
"On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg, and his heart rate was increased at 110 beats per minute. He had bilateral pitting edema in both lower limbs up to the knees. There were no skin lesions or rashes noted. His heart sounds were muffled, with a third heart sound audible during auscultation.  Laboratory investigations revealed a mild elevation of white blood cells (12,000 cells/mm3) with increased eosinophil count (10%). The rest of the complete blood count was within normal limits. Liver function tests showed mildly raised transaminases (ALT and AST), while kidney function tests indicated mildly elevated creatinine levels.  Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion, confirming the presence of fluid around the heart. An electrocardiogram showed low voltage QRS complexes and electrical alternans - a classic finding in pericardial effusions.  Given the patient's clinical presentation and findings on examination and investigations, a provisional diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis was made. Constrictive pericarditis refers to the thickening and scarring of the pericardium, which eventually restricts cardiac filling during diastole.  The etiology of constrictive pericarditis can vary widely, but in this case, it was suspected to be due to an underlying systemic disease process called eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome.  EGPA is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of small- to medium-sized blood vessels associated with asthma and peripheral eosinophilia. It commonly affects multiple organ systems including lungs, skin, kidneys, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract as well as the cardiovascular system.  Further investigations including echocardiography confirmed thickened pericardium and significant restriction of diastolic filling. Cardiac catheterization was performed to assess hemodynamics, which showed characteristic dip-and-plateau pattern of equalization of diastolic pressures in all cardiac chambers, further supporting the diagnosis.  Treatment was initiated with corticosteroids in high doses to suppress the inflammatory response. As EGPA also involves other organs, additional immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide was also warranted in this case to prevent further disease progression.  Over the next few weeks, there was a gradual improvement in the patient's symptoms. His bilateral leg swelling resolved, and he reported a significant improvement in his exercise tolerance without any shortness of breath. Repeat echocardiography showed decreased pericardial thickness and improved diastolic function.  Long-term management for EGPA involves a careful balance between reducing inflammation with immunosuppressive agents and managing potential side effects from these medications. Regular monitoring is necessary to detect relapse or any complications related to medication use.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering systemic diseases as an underlying cause for atypical clinical presentations such as progressive lower limb swelling and unexplained weight loss. Prompt recognition and appropriate diagnosis are crucial for initiating timely treatment to prevent irreversible organ damage. The role of thorough history-taking, physical examination, and comprehensive investigations cannot be overstated in determining the underlying cause and formulating a treatment plan that offers optimal outcomes for patients with complex medical conditions such as EGPA-induced constrictive pericarditis. Additionally, it is worth noting that the patient's previous course of oral antibiotics and minimal improvement in symptoms could be attributed to the fact that EGPA does not typically respond well to antibiotics. This highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses and conducting further investigations when initial treatment approaches are ineffective.  Furthermore, the presence of eosinophilia in the complete blood count may have provided a clue towards an underlying systemic disease. Eosinophilia is often associated with various allergic and autoimmune conditions, including EGPA. Therefore, a thorough evaluation should always include an assessment of blood counts to aid in narrowing down potential diagnoses.  Another significant aspect of this case is the involvement of multiple organ systems. The patient's symptoms extended beyond just cardiovascular manifestations, as evidenced by his intermittent fevers and unintentional weight loss. This underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists from various fields such as cardiology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and nephrology to ensure comprehensive care.  The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis caused by EGPA may be challenging as it can mimic other cardiopulmonary diseases or even malignancies that present with similar symptoms such as heart failure or pleural effusions. Hence, a high index of suspicion coupled with careful evaluation is paramount for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.  Moreover, early recognition and intervention are crucial in preventing further complications associated with constrictive pericarditis such as right heart failure or even cardiac tamponade – a life-threatening condition characterized by compression of the heart due to excessive fluid accumulation within the pericardial sac.  In terms of prognosis, timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy can significantly improve outcomes for patients with EGPA-induced constrictive pericarditis. Regular monitoring for disease activity and potential side effects from medications becomes crucial during long-term management.  Patient education regarding recognizing signs or symptoms indicative of disease relapse is also essential so that they can seek prompt medical attention. It is important for patients to understand the necessity of adherence to medications and regular follow-up visits with their healthcare providers.  In conclusion, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of considering systemic diseases in patients presenting with atypical symptoms such as progressive lower limb swelling and unintentional weight loss. With a comprehensive approach involving detailed history-taking, thorough physical examination, and appropriate investigations, healthcare professionals can identify underlying conditions like EGPA-induced constrictive pericarditis. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment are vital in optimizing outcomes for patients facing complex medical conditions like this.",continue

"After the crown lengthening procedure, the patient was reassessed for any further dental interventions. Upon examination, it was noticed that the tooth had extensive fracture lines on the mesial and distal surfaces. The fracture extended deep into the root structure, making it difficult to salvage the tooth.  Given the severity of the fracture and inability to preserve the natural tooth, an alternative treatment plan was discussed with patient. The options included extraction followed by implant placement or bridge prosthetics to replace the missing tooth.  The patient expressed concerns about going through another surgical procedure for implant placement and opted for a bridge prosthesis instead. With his consent, a fixed partial denture (FPD) or bridge was planned as an optimal solution for his dental problem.  To begin with, a thorough examination of adjacent teeth alongside radiographic assessment was carried out. This helped in evaluating their health status and determining their stability to support a bridge prosthesis both structurally and functionally.  A conventional three-unit porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) bridge design consisting of two abutment teeth and one pontic were decided upon as a suitable treatment option. Impressions were taken using elastomeric impression material for accurate replica of prepared teeth structure along with surrounding soft tissues.  After obtaining accurate impressions, temporary acrylic crowns were fabricated using preformed temporary crown shells in order to provide immediate provisionalization while permanent restoration is being fabricated at dental laboratory.   During subsequent visits over period of two weeks, adjustments had been made ensuring proper occlusal contacts and esthetics are attained with provisional restorations assisting in maintaining oral hygiene.   Upon completion of fabrication from dental laboratory technician , final cementation appointment was given which involved removing temporary restoration followed by attempt for try-in of permanent PFM restorations over individual prepared abutments ensuring intimacy between underlying natural dentition using appropriate luting cement.   Finally after satisfying clinical results being accomplished through adequate occlusion , esthetics and overall prosthesis stability of the final restoration, permanent cementing was done securing the PFM bridge onto abutment teeth.   The patient was pleased with his new dental restoration as it not only restored his oral function but also improved his smile. He was advised on proper oral hygiene maintenance techniques to ensure longevity of the prosthetic work.  Follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the condition of the bridge, as well as any potential complications or issues that may arise over time.

"Patient 1 was referred to our department for further evaluation and management. Upon physical examination, he exhibited signs of virilization including deepening of the voice, facial hair growth, and muscular development. His blood pressure was within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, confirming the diagnosis of 11β-hydroxylase deficiency.  Treatment for Patient 1 was initiated with replacement doses of glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone). Regular monitoring of hormone levels and adrenal function were conducted to ensure adequate dosage adjustments.  Meanwhile, Patient 2, a 35-year-old female (46, XX karyotype), also from the same consanguineous family, presented with complaints of infertility following four years of unsuccessful attempts at conceiving. Investigations revealed polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) characterized by oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism. Additionally, she had hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans.  Further workup confirmed the presence of 11β-hydroxylase deficiency in Patient 2 as well. Similar to her male counterpart, she started replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone to manage her condition effectively. Hormonal therapy aimed at controlling hyperandrogenism was also initiated to improve her chances of conception.  Patient 3 emerged as a new case during this family's follow-up visits in our department; this time a male infant aged nine months (46, XY karyotype). Routine neonatal screening had identified elevated levels of serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Further investigations confirmed that he too had inherited the same mutation responsible for his siblings' condition – homozygosity for CYP11B1 gene mutations leading to deficient expression or activity of the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme.  Early intervention was essential for Patient 3 to prevent potential complications and ensure normal growth and development. Initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy was crucial to achieve adequate cortisol levels, counteract excess adrenal androgen production, and avoid symptoms associated with salt-wasting.  Lastly, Patient 4, a 28-year-old female (46, XX karyotype), presented with features of oligomenorrhea and obesity. Clinical evaluation revealed increased blood pressure levels along with signs of excessive cortisol production such as moon facies, buffalo hump, and purple striae. Laboratory investigations indicated hypocortisolism accompanied by hyperandrogenism.  Patient 4 underwent detailed endocrine evaluation which confirmed the diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia secondary to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. Treatments involving glucocorticoid replacement therapy combined with anti-androgen drugs were initiated promptly in order to improve her hormonal balance while also targeting weight reduction strategies for her overall health improvement.  Genetic counseling sessions were conducted for all four patients along with their extended family members who displayed interest in understanding their risk of passing on the condition. Counseling focused on explaining inheritance patterns as an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene.  Regular follow-up visits ensured that appropriate monitoring of hormone levels was maintained alongside evaluation for any potential complications arising from long-term hormonal therapy use. The importance of lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy body weight, regular exercise routines, stress management techniques were emphasized during these visits to support overall well-being.  In conclusion, this case study highlights the impact of familial genetic disorders such as 11β-hydroxylase deficiency on multiple generations within a family unit. Adequate screening methods followed by early detection and prompt intervention help alleviate symptoms while preventing long-term complications associated with these conditions",continue
"Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited signs of restlessness, agitation, and aggression. He displayed rapid and erratic movements, often attempting to strike out or verbally abuse those around him. The sudden onset of these symptoms raised concerns among the medical team about potential underlying complications.  Due to the recent history of traumatic brain injury and the patient's aggressive behavior, a thorough examination was conducted to determine the cause of his sudden change in behavior. It was essential to rule out any organic causes that could be contributing to his agitation. Laboratory tests were performed, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and urine toxicology screening – all returning normal results.  Based on his symptoms and clinical presentation, we suspected that neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) might be responsible for his current condition. NMS is a rare but potentially life-threatening neurological disorder most commonly associated with antipsychotic medications; however it can also occur following abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of dopamine agonists or anti-parkinsonian medications.  The primary symptoms of NMS include hyperthermia (elevated body temperature), generalized muscle rigidity (stiffness), autonomic dysfunction (changes in blood pressure and heart rate), altered mental status (confusion or delirium), and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood due to muscle breakdown.  To confirm our suspicion further investigations were conducted including monitoring vital signs regularly - documenting an elevated body temperature reaching 40°C along with high heart rate exceeding 120 bpm - indicative findings supporting our diagnosis hypothesis.  Immediate intervention was initiated by discontinuing all antipsychotic medications which he had been prescribed for managing mood swings during his stay at spinal cord rehabilitation unit. Close attention was given towards maintaining fluid balance along with measures directed towards enhancing cooling mechanisms such as removal clothing/wrapping cold packs around groin/axillae/groin/armpits/bathing him with cool water sponge/cold wet blankets, etc.  In order to provide the patient with the relief and control his worsening condition required, we administered an intravenous muscle relaxant medication called dantrolene. This drug acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant by directly affecting the calcium release mechanism within muscle cells. The aim of using this medication was to alleviate his severe muscular rigidity, decrease temperature and autonomic dysregulation.  Over the course of several days, his symptoms began to subside gradually. His temperature normalized, and there was a significant reduction in his aggressive behavior and muscle rigidity. The patient’s mental status improved noticeably as well; he became more coherent and responsive during therapy sessions.  After an extensive multidisciplinary team discussion involving psychiatric consultants, physical therapy specialists along with family meetings - it was decided that patient should not be discharged without appropriate rehab & psychiatric actions implemented adequately considering case complexity & needs followed by closer monitoring for any signs suggesting relapse or prodromal symptoms presented in pre-discharge clinical profile.  The remaining period at hospital mainly focused on providing adequate counseling regarding coping mechanisms aimed towards trauma management - employing psychological interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapies in conjunction with medications prescribing advised throughout expert psychiatric consulting regarding mood stabilization (applying SSRIs).  Although further follow-up is still required given the seriousness of NMS and its potential long-term complications such as neurocognitive impairment – the primary aim is currently optimizing pharmacological adjustments so that acute phase concerns are managed promptly preventing recurrence whilst efforts should be directed at maximizing participation levels allowing a successful return back to functional independent life ahead after discharge planning implementation factoring procedural scheduling/appropriate trained support staff/family collaboration/residence ensuring home modifications/and continuing specialized rehab outpatient clinic & psychiatrically supervised community/day program involvement till for local provision reach out available alongside internal/external tele-rehabilitation frameworks investment provided accessibilities are addressed while addressing distinct social needs chronic SCI associations/modalities offer maintaining patients' core activities involvement.</p",continue
"Upon assessing the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is important to consider potential complications or infections related to her recent surgical procedures.  The presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea in this young female indicates a possible systemic infection. Given her recent perineal abscess drainage procedure, there is a concern that she may have developed an infection at the surgical site. The sore throat and neck pain could potentially be attributed to lymph node involvement or as a result of spread from the perineal area.  Tissue edema in the right-side gluteal region also raises suspicion for a potential infection following the perineal abscess drainage. Abscesses can develop when bacteria infect hair follicles or sweat glands in that region. If not treated appropriately or if contamination occurs during drainage, these abscesses can worsen or lead to further complications like cellulitis.  Additionally, considering her recent medical history including endometrial curettage for ERPC (Evacuation of Retained Products of Conception) and conservative therapy for hemorrhoids 15 days later, it is crucial to rule out any possible infections from those procedures as well. Endometrial curettage involves removing tissue from inside the uterus and may carry risks of infection if proper sterile techniques are not followed. Conservative therapy for hemorrhoids might involve interventions like stool softeners or topical ointments which are generally low-risk but still susceptible to contamination causing infection if hygiene practices aren't adhered to.  Given her vital signs indicating hypotension and tachycardia along with multiple symptoms suggestive of infection at distinct anatomical sites following recent surgical interventions make immediate medical attention imperative.  In order to establish an accurate diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment promptly, several tests should be considered:  1. Blood cultures: This will help identify any bacterial presence in circulation. 2. Imaging studies: An ultrasound scan could assess tissue involvement and identify any collections or abscesses in the perineal region. 3. Swab cultures: Taking samples from the patient's throat, neck, and gluteal region will help determine the causative organism and guide targeted antibiotic therapy.  Immediate management should also be initiated to stabilize vital signs. The patient may require intravenous fluids to address hypotension, along with supplemental oxygen if respiratory distress worsens.  Empirical antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly to target potential organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains - MRSA) and Streptococcus species, which are commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. The choice of antibiotics will be based on local antibiotic resistance patterns as well as any known risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms.  Given her recent surgical procedures involving the perineum, it is important to monitor her closely for signs of developing sepsis or worsening infection. Additionally, pain management can be provided through appropriate analgesics or local measures such as warm compresses to alleviate discomfort in the affected regions.  A multidisciplinary approach is vital in this patient's care involving close communication between emergency medicine physicians, surgeons specialized in infectious diseases if necessary, nurses specializing in wound care management, and microbiologists involved in identifying causative organisms through laboratory testing.  Lastly, emphasis must be placed on ensuring proper wound care techniques during future procedures while adhering strictly to sterile practices. Patient education regarding signs of infection should also play a key role so that they may seek help promptly when needed.  In summary,  The 23-year-old female patient who presented with fever,tachycardia,hypotension,tachypnoea,sore throat,bilateral neck pain,diffuse pain,and tissue edema at right-side gluteal region exhibited symptoms consistent with systemic infection potentially originating from recent surgical procedures including perineal abscess drainage,endometrial curettage for ERPC,and conservative therapy for hemorrhoids. Urgent medical attention is necessary to establish a precise diagnosis and commence appropriate treatment. Tests such as blood cultures,imaging studies,swab cultures and antibiotic therapy targeting common organisms associated with infections following surgical procedures should be promptly implemented. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination between various healthcare specialists will ensure optimal care in managing the patient's condition whilst educating the patient about recognizing signs of infection to enable early intervention in future instances",continue
"Upon examination, the boy appeared pale and uncomfortable. His vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C. The abdominal examination revealed a tender, firm mass in the right lumbar region with no associated guarding or rigidity. On further inspection, there was no evidence of trauma or visible bruising on his abdomen.  A complete blood count (CBC) revealed mild leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) with neutrophil predominance and a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Other laboratory investigations including liver function tests and renal function tests were within normal limits.  Considering the persistent fever and localized abdominal pain, an ultrasound scan of the abdomen was conducted. The scan showed an enlarged right kidney with multiple hypoechoic lesions present within it. These findings indicated that the patient may have pyelonephritis or a potential renal abscess.  The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting common urinary tract pathogens while awaiting further evaluation. A urine culture and sensitivity test were performed, which confirmed significant bacteriuria along with isolation of Escherichia coli (E.coli), a common pathogen causing urinary tract infections.  As part of the management plan, appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated based on sensitive antibiotic susceptibility testing for E.coli isolates from the urine culture. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment for any progression in symptoms were implemented.  A consultation with a nephrologist was arranged to provide specialized care for this young patient with nodding syndrome complicated by pyelonephritis/renal abscess formation.In addition to antibiotics treatment,nephrologist advised to hydrate him adequately during his illness.He also highlighted importance good nutrition.As advancing nodding syndrome may contribute progressive disability,the neurologic care needed ongoing close monitoring as epilepsy poorly controlled has been associated prognostically poor outcome .  Over the next few days, there was significant improvement in the patient's fever, abdominal pain, and overall well-being. Repeat blood tests showed a decreasing leukocyte count and normalized ESR. The patient's urine culture was negative for bacterial growth after completing the antibiotic course.  The boy was discharged from the hospital with instructions to complete a full course of oral antibiotics at home. He was also provided with nutritional supplements to aid his recovery and advised on maintaining good hygiene practices to prevent recurrence of urinary tract infections.  The importance of regular follow-up visits with both the nodding syndrome treatment center and nephrologist were emphasized to ensure proper management of his underlying condition as well as any potential complications that may arise in the future.  This case highlighted an atypical presentation in a 13-year-old boy with nodding syndrome, demonstrating how seemingly unrelated symptoms can overlap with other conditions. Through prompt diagnosis and appropriate intervention, this patient's pyelonephritis/renal abscess was successfully treated, leading to a favorable outcome.  Further research is needed to better understand possible connections between nodding syndrome and concurrent medical conditions such as renal abscesses or pyelonephritis. By expanding knowledge on these associations, healthcare providers can develop more comprehensive strategies for managing patients affected by nodding syndrome effectively. The management of nodding syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach, including neurologists, infectious disease specialists, and other healthcare professionals. This case highlighted the importance of collaboration between different specialties when treating complex cases.  Nodding syndrome is a mysterious neurological disorder that primarily affects children in certain regions of East Africa. Its exact cause is still unknown, although various theories suggest that the syndrome may be associated with factors such as malnutrition, infection, or exposure to toxins.  In addition to its effect on motor function and cognitive development, nodding syndrome can have systemic manifestations that require proper evaluation and treatment. This case illustrated the importance of considering other potential health issues in patients with nodding syndrome.  As research on nodding syndrome continues to evolve, healthcare providers are becoming more aware of the wide range of symptoms and complications associated with this condition. Improved understanding will enable early recognition and appropriate management of related medical conditions like pyelonephritis/renal abscesses.  Education plays a crucial role in preventing nodding syndrome and ensuring early intervention once diagnosed. Community awareness programs should emphasize good hygiene practices to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and other potential triggers for complications.  For individuals living with nodding syndrome, regular monitoring by healthcare professionals will allow for timely identification and management of emerging health issues. Preventive measures such as adhering to medication regimens for epilepsy control are also essential in optimizing patient outcomes.   It is important not only to focus on symptom relief but also address underlying causes or comorbidities like infections promptly. By providing comprehensive care that takes into account both neurologic needs as well as general health concerns like renal abscesses or pyelonephritis,families affected by nodding syndromes can have increased confidence in managing their loved one's condition.  In conclusion,nodding Syndrome remains a challenging disorder affecting children in susceptible regions.With concerted efforts from international organizations,researchers,and local communities hope exists towards unraveling the complexetiessurrounding this enigmatic disorder.A comprehensive approach that encompasses both neurological and medical management will be instrumental in improving outcomes for individuals with nodding syndrome.

"Upon further evaluation, the patient's medical history and current symptoms suggested a possible connection between her headaches and her diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS).  Sturge-Weber Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that is typically present from birth. It is characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port-wine stain, which is caused by an overabundance of capillaries in the face. This condition also affects blood vessels in the brain, causing abnormalities that can lead to various neurological symptoms.  In the case of this 21-year-old female patient, her seizures during infancy were consistent with SWS. Seizures are one of the most common symptoms associated with this syndrome and often occur within the first year of life. However, it is not uncommon for individuals with SWS to experience additional neurological issues throughout their lives.  Headaches may be another symptom related to SWS. The patient reported experiencing non-pulsating headaches for the past two years, which were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These headaches did not worsen with physical activity and had no accompanying nausea or aura-like symptoms. The duration of these headaches lasting for hours suggests they may fall under the category of tension-type headaches - a common type of headache characterized by bilateral, pressing pain that can be long-lasting.  Although tension-type headaches are known to be common among many individuals without underlying medical conditions, it is possible that in this particular case, these headaches could be related to her existing diagnosis of SWS. The presence of abnormal blood vessels in the brain due to SWS could potentially contribute to vascular changes or disruptions leading to recurring headache episodes.  To confirm or rule out any possible connection between these two factors - SWS and recurrent tension-type headache - further diagnostic testing should be carried out. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information about any structural abnormalities in the brain associated with SWS, which could help explain the presence of headaches.  Additionally, a thorough neurological examination should be conducted to assess any other potential contributing factors. This examination may include assessing the port-wine stain for any signs of progression, evaluating cognitive function, and monitoring for any other accompanying symptoms that could provide insights into the origin and nature of the headaches.  Treatment options for tension-type headaches related to SWS would generally involve a combination of acute headache relief medication (such as NSAIDs) and preventive measures to reduce headache frequency. Lifestyle modifications like stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, and maintaining proper sleep habits may also be beneficial.  Furthermore, given the patient's history of seizures associated with SWS and the potential neurologic implications it may have on her overall health and quality of life, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary healthcare team is essential. Regular follow-ups with a neurologist specializing in epilepsy can help ensure optimal management strategies for both seizures and headaches while addressing any evolving medical needs.  In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient's recurrent non-pulsating headaches in association with her diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome indicate a possible link between these two conditions. To establish an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate management plan, further evaluation through imaging studies like MRI alongside comprehensive neurological assessment is warranted. Collaborative care involving neurologists specializing in epilepsy will play an essential role in managing her symptoms effectively while prioritizing her overall well-being.",continue
"During the visit, a detailed medical history is obtained from Mrs. AMS to gather information about her symptoms and potential risk factors. She reports that the episodes of lipothymia, which are brief moments of feeling faint or dizzy, have been occurring over the past three months. They happen at rest, even while she is lying in bed or driving her car.  In addition to lipothymia, she experiences palpitations before each episode and also complains of dizziness, light-headedness, and short-lasting blurred vision during the episodes. However, she denies any difficulty breathing or other stress-related symptoms during these episodes.  To further evaluate Mrs. AMS's condition and assess her cardiovascular risk factors, a physical examination is conducted by the healthcare provider. The examination includes measuring her BMI (body mass index), which reveals that she is overweight with a BMI of 29.14.  Furthermore, during the examination it is noted that Mrs. AMS has a family history of an early death in her father at age 33 due to kidney failure associated with hypertension.  Based on this information gathered from both the medical history and physical examination, further investigations are required to determine the cause of Mrs.AMS's symptoms and assess her overall cardiovascular health.  One possibility for Mrs.AMS's current presentation could be related to cardiac arrhythmias such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). This condition often presents with palpitations followed by lightheadedness or syncope due to inadequate blood flow to the brain during periods of abnormal heart rhythms.  Another potential cause could be carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH), where stimulation of certain receptors in the neck can lead to sudden decreases in heart rate and blood pressure resulting in syncope-like symptoms including dizziness and loss of consciousness.  Given Mrs.AMS's family history of premature death secondary to kidney failure associated with hypertension, it may also be important to assess her blood pressure and kidney function. High blood pressure can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke or heart attack, which could potentially manifest with symptoms similar to those reported by Mrs.AMS.  To evaluate these possibilities and identify the underlying cause of her symptoms, further diagnostic tests are recommended. These may include but are not limited to an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for any electrical abnormalities in the heart's rhythm, an echocardiogram to evaluate overall cardiac function and structure, a carotid sinus massage/stimulation test to assess for CSH, and laboratory investigations including blood pressure measurement and kidney function tests.  Once these investigations have been completed and a definitive diagnosis is made, appropriate management strategies can be implemented. This may include lifestyle modifications such as weight loss for Mrs.AMS's overweight condition if indicated. Additionally, pharmacotherapy or other interventions may be recommended depending on the specific diagnosis.  In conclusion, Mrs.AMS's presentation of paroxysmal lipothymia accompanied by palpitations warrants further investigation into potential cardiac arrhythmias or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Given her family history of hypertension-related kidney failure and her increased BMI, it is important to also evaluate her blood pressure levels and renal function during this assessment. A comprehensive approach will allow for proper diagnosis and subsequent management options tailored specifically for Mrs.AMS's condition.",continue
"g/dl, INR: 1.2, AFP: 300 ng/ml, CA19-9: 58 U/ml.  Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST, ALT, ALP, GGT), hepatomegaly and splenomegaly; further investigations were warranted to determine the underlying cause.  An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed which showed diffuse heterogeneous liver parenchyma with multiple hypoechoic lesions. There was also evidence of portal hypertension with dilated portal vein and splenomegaly. These findings raised suspicion of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  In order to confirm the diagnosis and stage the cancer, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The CT scan revealed a large hypervascular mass occupying most of the right lobe of the liver with irregular borders and central necrosis. A biopsy was then taken from this lesion which confirmed HCC.  Further investigation into potential risk factors for HCC in this patient revealed that he had chronic hepatitis B infection detected by positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and high viral load. The patient's HBV DNA levels were found to be significantly elevated (>1 million IU/mL).  The presence of chronic hepatitis B infection in this patient greatly increased his risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is a known major risk factor for HCC development globally. It is estimated to contribute to approximately 50% - 80% of cases worldwide.  Additionally, other contributing factors include long-term smoking history as well as advanced age. Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of developing HCC due to carcinogenic agents present in cigarettes that are metabolized by the liver.  Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma depend on various factors including tumor size, location within the liver, stage of disease and overall health status of the patient. In this case, due to the large size of the tumor and involvement of a significant portion of the liver, surgical resection was not feasible.  A multidisciplinary team comprising hepatologists, oncologists, radiologists and surgeons was involved in formulating an appropriate treatment plan for this patient. The patient was started on targeted therapy using sorafenib - an oral kinase inhibitor that blocks multiple signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis.  Regular monitoring with imaging studies (CT scans, MRI) and blood tests were used to assess treatment response and disease progression. The patient showed initial signs of tumor regression with decreased AFP levels and reduction in size of the liver lesion after three months of therapy.  However, over time, new lesions appeared in the liver indicating disease progression despite treatment with sorafenib. Evaluation for alternative treatment options such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is being considered to provide localized control of tumors within the liver.  The overall prognosis for patients with HCC depends on various factors including stage at diagnosis, underlying liver function and response to treatments. Despite advancements in diagnostics and therapies for HCC, it remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide due to its aggressive nature and limited curative options at advanced stages.  In conclusion, this case highlights a middle-aged male patient presenting with abdominal pain alongside abnormal liver function tests indicative of hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis B infection along with a history of smoking were found to be significant risk factors contributing to HCC development. Timely diagnosis and initiation̈",continue
"Title: A Case of Respiratory Distress in a Non-Diabetic Female from Kenya  Clinical History: Ms. Lucy, a 39-year-old non-diabetic Kenyan female, presented to our outpatient department complaining of persistent cough with expectoration, chest pain, reduced appetite, fever with chills, and night sweats over the past three weeks. She also reported experiencing breathlessness on exertion and noticed two episodes of blood in her sputum. Lucy revealed that her cough was continuous but subsided after taking over-the-counter cough syrup. She further explained that initially her fever episodes were intermittent but progressively worsened over the last two weeks, requiring relief from Paracetamol.  Past Medical History: Lucy had no significant past medical history and had never experienced similar symptoms before. She denied any long-term medication use or exposure to potentially harmful environmental factors such as smoking or occupational hazards.  Social History: Lucy belonged to a rural community in Kenya where she lived with her husband and three children. They relied heavily on farming for their livelihood and had frequent interactions with livestock due to their occupation. There was no known history of tuberculosis or other respiratory illnesses among her family members or close contacts.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination, Lucy appeared visibly fatigued with mild pallor present on conjunctival examination indicating possible anemia due to chronic inflammation/infection process. Her vital signs were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Respiratory examination revealed diminished breath sounds over the lower right lung field along with fine crackles during auscultation.  Diagnostic Workup: Given the strong possibility of an infectious etiology presenting as respiratory distress accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and night sweats, initial investigations were ordered:  1) Complete Blood Count (CBC): Hemoglobin (Hb) level - 11 g/dL (low); White Blood Cell (WBC) count - 12,800 cells/μl (elevated); Differential count showed increased neutrophils and lymphocytes. 2) Chest X-Ray: Revealed a peripheral consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung suggestive of pneumonia. 3) Sputum Microscopy and Culture: Demonstrated numerous acid-fast bacilli (AFB), indicating a high likelihood of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and sputum smear results consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis, Lucy was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Treatment Plan: Lucy was started on an intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for two months. Afterward, she would transition to a continuation phase consisting of isoniazid and rifampicin for another four months. Additionally, supportive measures were employed including symptomatic relief using over-the-counter cough syrup as needed along with Paracetamol for fever control. Lucy was counseled regarding adherence to medication regimen along with infection control precautions to minimize transmission risks to her family members.  Follow-up: Lucy was advised to return for regular follow-up every month during her treatment course. Serial sputum smears would be obtained after completion of the intensive phase of therapy to monitor bacterial clearance from her lungs.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary tuberculosis as one potential diagnosis in patients presenting with persistent cough accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever and night sweats even in individuals without known risk factors or pre-existing medical conditions. Early identification through detailed clinical evaluation, appropriate investigations like sputum microscopy/culture leading to timely initiation of anti-tuberculosis medication can help prevent disease progression while reducing transmission within communities.",create
"Title: An Unusual Presentation of Primary Amenorrhea and Pelvic Pain in a 16-year-old Female Patient  Introduction: We present here an intriguing case study of a 16-year-old female patient who came to our clinic with primary amenorrhea and chronic cyclic pelvic pain. The absence of any significant medical history adds to the uniqueness of this case, warranting further investigation into potential underlying causes.  Case Presentation: Ms. A.V., a previously healthy young woman, initially sought medical attention due to the absence of menstruation coupled with intermittent pelvic discomfort that had been progressively worsening over the past six months. She expressed concerns about her delayed puberty development compared to her peers. Physical examination conducted at our facility revealed key findings that merit closer examination.  Upon inspection, Ms. A.V.'s physical appearance reflected normal growth patterns for a girl her age, exhibiting well-developed secondary sexual characteristics and an appropriate morphological type indicative of normal growth hormone activity according to Tanner staging criteria. Furthermore, she presented without any apparent abnormalities in her external genitalia during vulvo-perineal examination, which displayed properly defined labia majora and minora along with an observable clitoris.  However, it is notable that upon palpation of the pelvis during physical examination, we discovered a firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm in width and 2 cm in height adjacent to Ms. A.V.'s uterus. This finding promoted further investigations as we aimed to establish its etiology and explore potential correlation with primary amenorrhea and pelvic pain.  Diagnostic Workup: Considering our patient's presentation combined with physical examination findings suggestive of structural anomalies within the pelvis contributing to amenorrhea, we decided on several diagnostic imaging modalities.  1) Ultrasonography: Pelvic ultrasonography was performed carefully by an experienced radiologist specializing in obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound evaluation at our facility. The imaging revealed no evidence of uterine or vaginal agenesis, but it did identify the presence of a sizeable, heterogeneous mass adjacent to the uterus. Further characterization was provided by Doppler imaging to assess its vascular supply.  2) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): To gain further insight into the nature and extent of pelvic pathology, an MRI was conducted using contrast enhancement sequences. This investigation confirmed the presence of a solid mass originating from within the left ovary with marked vascularity identified on contrast-enhanced sequences.  3) Laboratory Investigations: A comprehensive panel of hormonal assays were collected to evaluate Ms. A.V.'s reproductive hormone levels including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). These tests allowed us to ascertain if endocrine abnormalities were involved in her primary amenorrhea and pelvic pain symptoms.  Discussion: The clinical presentation in this case differs significantly from that typically associated with primary amenorrhea related to genitourinary anomalies. While initial examination findings appeared unremarkable, further imaging methods revealed a solid ovarian mass exhibiting vascularity consistent with abnormal ovarian tissue growth. These findings indicate that Ms. A.V.'s primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain may be attributed to an underlying pathological condition affecting her left ovary.  Conclusion: This case illustrates an unusual presentation of primary amenorrhea accompanied by chronic cyclic pelvic pain in a 16-year-old female patient without any notable medical history or evident external genitalia abnormalities. The identification of a solid ovarian mass on diagnostic imaging serves as impetus for further investigation into its etiology and appropriate management strategies.  Since this is an imaginary clinical case inspired by real cases, it's important to note that these findings are purely fictional for educational purposes only. Any resemblance or similarity is coincidental.",create
"In July 2020, a 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She reported experiencing severe headaches and muscle pain over the past few days, along with a tightness in her chest. Despite being a non-smoker, she found herself struggling to breathe during exertion.   Upon arrival, her temperature was recorded as 38.9°C (102°F), indicating a significant fever. Initial assessment revealed an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) level of 88%, highlighting the compromised respiratory function. Additionally, her heart rate was measured at 110 beats per minute, indicative of tachycardia.  A thorough physical examination was conducted, revealing cardiac gallop rhythm upon auscultation and coarse crackles throughout both lung fields up to the middle third – suggesting abnormal lung sounds that occur in conditions such as pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  The patient denied any history of alcohol consumption or drug abuse and did not recall recent contact with sick individuals who may have transmitted an infectious disease to her.  Further investigation into her clinical symptoms revealed additional concerning findings. The patient reported experiencing persistent fatigue and malaise over the past week before being admitted to the hospital.  Given these symptoms and clinical presentation suggestive of possible respiratory distress associated with viral infections such as COVID-19 or influenza-like illnesses commonly observed during flu seasons; an initial diagnosis aimed at ruling out potential underlying causes needed to be explored further through laboratory investigations.  Various diagnostic tests were ordered for further evaluation including complete blood count (CBC), arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), blood cultures for bacterial infection screening due to concern for co-infection possibilities alongside current pandemic-related guidelines.  Laboratory findings yielded results consistent with inflammatory markers typically seen in viral respiratory infections: leukocytosis indicating elevated white blood cell count; a largely unremarkable arterial blood gas analysis except for mild hypoxemia reflected by low oxygen levels in the blood; and normal results for blood cultures, ruling out bacterial pathogens as the primary cause.  Furthermore, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected for COVID-19 testing in accordance with established protocols to exclude an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid antigen testing returned negative results at that time, reducing the suspicion for a new coronavirus infection.  Given her clinical presentation and inconclusive test findings, additional diagnostic studies were deemed necessary. Chest X-ray imaging revealed multifocal infiltrates suggestive of atypical pneumonia or viral etiologies warranting supportive management while awaiting further serological investigations.  Based on her symptoms reported since onset and ongoing investigation outcomes thus far, provisional treatment was started involving broad-spectrum antibiotics to target potential secondary bacterial infection based on clinical judgement.  She was admitted to the medical-surgical unit for close monitoring of her respiratory status in light of hypoxemia and tachycardia. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula was initiated initially providing low-flow supplemental oxygen to assist with maintaining adequate oxygen saturation levels and addressing respiratory distress during activity periods. Continuous assessment ensured timely escalation from low-flow to high-flow oxygen delivery if required during hospitalization.  The patient's condition demanded vigilant care due to continued respiratory compromise highlighting a need for continuous monitoring throughout her hospital stay including frequent assessment of peripheral perfusion parameters along with regular vital signs checks by nursing staff ensuring prompt intervention if any adverse changes were observed.",create
"We present a clinical case of a 3-year-old male who was admitted for evaluation and management of respiratory distress. The patient had a recent history of fever and cough, which responded well to treatment and resolved completely. However, concerned parents noticed a significant decline in the child's growth, with the weight at presentation being only 8 kgs and height measuring 80 cm.   On initial assessment, the child displayed tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, an elevated respiratory rate of 40 cycles per minute, and blood pressure measuring 90/60 mmHg. Auscultation revealed normal first and second heart sounds along with the presence of an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Further examination identified widespread coarse crackles bilaterally on chest auscultation along with subcostal recession during breathing. The child remained conscious throughout evaluation with intact neurological function observed - equal-sized pupils that reacted bilaterally to light stimuli, normal muscle tone globally, as well as full strength graded at level five in all limbs.  Upon further investigation into this case, we discovered that our patient had been experiencing intermittent bouts of mild fatigue and persistent sweating despite adequate hydration. Additionally, there were parental concerns about frequent episodes of increased urination.  Detailed analysis led us to suspect underlying endocrine dysfunction or metabolic abnormalities contributing to failure to thrive seen in this particular patient. To establish an accurate diagnosis for proper management planning moving forward, we initiated several investigations.  Laboratory studies revealed mild hyponatremia (sodium: 130 mEq/L) predominantly attributed to low urine sodium levels (10 mEq/L) indicating significant renal impairment in electrolyte regulation mechanisms. Further testing showed elevated morning cortisol levels (620 nmol/L), while thyroid function tests demonstrated decreased free thyroxine hormone levels within the subnormal range (T4: 5 mcg/dL, reference range: 6-12 mcg/dL).  Upon the evaluation of these findings and correlating them clinically, we suspected primary adrenal insufficiency accompanied by secondary hypothyroidism as the leading cause behind the patient's symptoms. The presence of fatigue, decreased appetite, poor weight gain, and low sodium levels further supported our initial assessment.  To provide appropriate care for our patient, we promptly initiated hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone administered in divided doses throughout the day to replace deficient cortisol levels. Simultaneously, levothyroxine supplementation commenced to correct underlying hypothyroidism safely.  The child exhibited a remarkable response to therapy within days. His respiratory distress noticeably improved along with reduced episodes of fatigue and sweating. Follow-up examinations displayed resolution of crackles on chest auscultation and improved overall muscle tone.  After several weeks on treatment protocol, our patient demonstrated positive adjustments in weight (increased to 10 kgs) as well as surge in height (measuring 85 cm). Repeat laboratory analysis showed corrected sodium levels at 136 mEq/L along with normalized thyroid hormone levels (T4: 8 mcg/dL).  In summary, we present a clinical case involving a 3-year-old male suffering from failure to thrive associated with respiratory distress and endocrine dysfunction. Following appropriate investigations leading us towards a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency concomitant with secondary hypothyroidism, prompt initiation of targeted hormone replacement therapy resulted in significant improvements across multiple symptoms and overall growth parameters seen throughout follow-up appointments.",create
"Case Report: A 45-year-old female with a history of obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency room with severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder. The pain started suddenly a few hours ago and has been progressively worsening. She denies any preceding abdominal trauma or recent changes in her dietary habits.  On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is found to have tenderness on deep palpation over the right upper quadrant. Murphy's sign is positive. Her vital signs are stable, with blood pressure at 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). No jaundice or other remarkable findings are noted.  Initial laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes; alanine transaminase (ALT) is at 74 U/L (reference range: 10-40 U/L), aspartate transaminase (AST) at 62 U/L (reference range: up to 38 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at106 U/L (<142U/L), total bilirubin levels within normal limits, white blood cell count at12 x10^9/L with neutrophil predominance.  An abdominal ultrasound examination is performed showing distention of the gallbladder with wall thickening measuring up to13 mm. Pericholecystic fluid collection is also noted without any evidence of common bile duct dilatation or choledocholithiasis.  Based on clinical presentation consistent with biliary colic and ultrasound findings suggestive of cholecystitis without any signs of common bile duct obstruction or gallstones within the duct system apparent upon ultrasound evaluation,. The patient was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis.  The patient was admitted for further observation and management including intravenous fluids, bowel rest, analgesia, and antibiotic therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and metronidazole. After an appropriate period of conservative management to optimize the patient's condition, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was recommended.  During surgery, under general anesthesia using an endotracheal tube for airway protection , extensive adhesions from prior surgeries were noted with tortuous gallbladder opatically distended. The cystic duct appears edematous and inflamed with difficulty dissecting it from hepatic tissue. Eventually the cystic duct was identified clamped and divided with electrocautery before inserting clips on either side of duct to secure hemostasis.  Upon removing the gallbladder from its bed considerable amount of purulent fluid oozes out through a contained perforation site suggestive gangrenous cholecystitis with superadded infection originating likely due to impacted stone within cystic duct leading containment effect preventing escape leakage into peritoneal cavity . Additionally there are multiple stones seen spilled into surgical field suggesting leakage from burst gallbladder as well as some stones found impacted in tubular structures consistent with bile ducts,  Due to excessive inflammation, meticulous dissection required extra attention allowing visual identification all visible leaked stones vacuumed through  irrigative-sucton apparatus Before closure saline lavage done.  Postoperatively,the patient was observed closely on intravenous antibiotics for five days until her clinical condition stabilized; she then transitioned to oral antibiotics after being afebrile for 48 hours. She had an uneventful postoperative course without further complications. Upon discharge, her pain resolved completely and she was advised on dietary modifications emphasizing low-fat food choices along regular exercise regimen aimed at weight reduction also encourage adherence strict compliance monitor glycemic chart self-monitoring bood glucose levels follow up routine outpatient basis annually similar clinic where operated completes overall evaluation every six months during follow-up visits any problems recurrent attacks or post-cholecystectomy syndrome.

"Observation 1: This was a 54-year-old man, with a history of chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis C infection, who presented with an isolated swelling in the right submandibular region, progressing for the past six months. Clinical examination: The patient appeared pale and fatigued but was otherwise in stable condition. He did not have fever or any signs of acute illness. The swelling was located beneath the angle of the mandible and measured approximately 4 cm in diameter. It was firm, well-defined, mobile, and non-tender to palpation. Additionally, there were multiple enlarged lymph nodes present in the right neck region that felt hard and fixed.  The patient denied any difficulty with chewing or swallowing and did not report any pain or discharge from the oral cavity. There were no noticeable changes or weakness affecting his face muscles, nor were there any signs of upper respiratory tract obstruction.  Observation 2: Laboratory investigations revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia consistent with iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL). Hematological parameters also showed reduced serum iron levels (30 mcg/dL), low ferritin levels (10 ng/mL), and increased total iron-binding capacity (400 mcg/dL).  Observation 3: Additional investigations included a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck which demonstrated a discrete submandibular mass without evidence of invasion into surrounding structures. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was then performed on both the submandibular swelling as well as an enlarged lymph node. The cytology reports from both specimens indicated squamous cell carcinoma.  Discussion: This case presents a middle-aged male patient with chronic liver disease found to have iron deficiency anemia along with a progressively enlarging submandibular swelling and associated lymphadenopathy on examination.  The differential diagnoses considered include infectious causes such as tuberculosis or bacterial cervical lymphadenitis; autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome; malignant neoplasm like squamous cell carcinoma, which can be associated with chronic liver disease and iron deficiency anemia; or a primary salivary gland tumor.  The investigation results are consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving the submandibular region and associated lymph nodes. The presence of iron deficiency anemia likely reflects concomitant chronic inflammatory processes related to the underlying liver disease, which may have contributed to the development and spread of malignancy.  The patient was referred to an oncology specialist for further evaluation and management. Treatment options considered include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical resection depending on the extent of local invasion and metastasis.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights the importance of considering different etiologies when evaluating patients presenting with submandibular swelling and associated lymphadenopathy. In this instance, a middle-aged male patient with underlying chronic liver disease was found to have metastatic squamous cell carcinoma as a cause for his symptoms. Early diagnosis through thorough assessment and appropriate investigations enables prompt initiation of treatment strategies aimed at improving outcomes for patients in similar situations. Observation 4: The patient underwent a thorough examination of the oral cavity, which revealed no notable abnormalities. There were no signs of dental pathology, ulcerations, or other concerning lesions. Palpation of the floor of the mouth showed no masses or indurations.  Observation 5: Given the association between chronic liver disease and iron deficiency anemia with an underlying malignancy, further investigations were conducted to determine the primary source. A comprehensive abdominal ultrasound was performed to assess liver nodularity and identify any suspicious lesions. Results revealed multiple hyperechoic nodules consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This finding confirmed that the metastatic squamous cell carcinoma likely originated from HCC.  Discussion:  The identification of multiple hyperechoic hepatic nodules on ultrasound suggests hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the primary malignancy responsible for metastasis to both submandibular region and lymph nodes. HCC is known for its high incidence in individuals with chronic liver disease, such as our patient who had a history of hepatitis C infection.  The spread from HCC to distant sites can occur through hematogenous dissemination via portal vein branches. In this case, lymph nodes in close proximity to the submandibular region have become involved in metastatic disease.  Management options will require a multidisciplinary approach involving oncology and hepatology specialists. Treatment goals will focus on addressing both primary HCC as well as managing metastases involving submandibular swelling and affected lymph nodes. Therapeutic interventions may include systemic chemotherapy targeting HCC along with locoregional therapies like radiotherapy or surgical excision for local control of submandibular tumor burden.  Conclusion:  This imaginary clinical case highlights an unusual yet plausible scenario wherein a middle-aged male patient with underlying chronic liver disease presented initially with iron deficiency anemia along with progressive submandibular swelling accompanied by hard-fixed cervical lymphadenopathy. Further investigations revealed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma originating from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the primary malignancy responsible for the widespread dissemination.  The combination of a thorough physical examination, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, and histopathological evaluation helped establish the diagnosis. Prompt recognition and appropriate management strategies, based on an interdisciplinary approach integrating expertise from oncology and hepatology specialists, are crucial in optimizing patient outcomes.  Continued research into such scenarios is essential to enhance our understanding of atypical clinical presentations associated with underlying diseases like chronic liver disease and highlight the importance of considering a wide range of differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with similar symptoms.",create
"Title: A Case of Juvenile Parkinsonism in a 16-year-old Female Patient  Clinical History: A 16-year-old female patient, whose parents have no known blood relation, presented at the neurology department with progressively worsening motor symptoms over the past year. The patient was originally an active teenager who excelled in sports, but she gradually experienced difficulties with movement coordination and speech. Her family reported no significant medical history or developmental delays during childhood.  Current Symptoms and Physical Examination: The patient's chief complaint was an increasing inability to perform daily activities and participate in school activities due to her poor motor coordination. On examination, she displayed akinesia and bradykinesia along with generalized muscle rigidity. The neurological assessment revealed expressive dysarthria that impacted her speech clarity.  Past Medical History: The patient had an uneventful birth via vaginal delivery without any complications or apparent neonatal distress. She achieved age-appropriate developmental milestones up until adolescence without any evident neuromuscular abnormalities.  Family History: There are no known cases of neurological disorders or consanguinity within the immediate family members.  Diagnostic Evaluation and Findings: Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, electrolyte levels, blood glucose level estimation were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed reduced signal intensity on T2-weighted images affecting substantia nigra bilaterally - a finding consistent with degeneration seen in Parkinsonism disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal cell counts and protein levels ruling out infectious etiologies like encephalitis or meningitis.  Treatment Plan: Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings this adolescent female had developed juvenile Parkinsonism – a rare form of Parkinson's disease that affects individuals before reaching 20 years old. Following diagnosis confirmation through multidisciplinary evaluation by pediatric neurologists, physiotherapists will initiate rehabilitation interventions to optimize her functional capacity and maintain independence in daily living skills.  The treatment plan will involve a combination of pharmacological therapies aimed at correcting the dopamine imbalance within the brain. The patient will be started on levodopa, which is converted to dopamine in the brain and helps alleviate symptoms such as bradykinesia and muscle rigidity. Alongside medication, physical therapy interventions including exercises to improve balance, gait training, range of motion exercises, and fine motor coordination tasks will be incorporated into her rehabilitation program.  Long-Term Management: Since juvenile Parkinsonism is a chronic disorder requiring lifelong management, regular patient follow-up visits are crucial to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment strategies accordingly. The interdisciplinary care team comprising neurologists, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists as well as psychological counsellors will collaborate in providing comprehensive care tailored to address both medical needs and psychosocial challenges associated with this condition.   Prognosis: The prognosis for individuals diagnosed with juvenile Parkinsonism can vary widely depending on factors such as age of onset and severity of symptoms. Although there is currently no cure for this condition affecting young individuals like our patient case described above; symptom management through pharmacological intervention along with early rehabilitation interventions have been reported to lead to improved quality of life outcomes.  In conclusion: This case report outlines the clinical presentation of a 16-year-old female patient diagnosed with juvenile Parkinsonism - characterized by akinesia/bradykinesia along with generalized muscle rigidity affecting her ability to perform daily activities. Early diagnosis coupled with an interdisciplinary management approach involving pharmacotherapy alongside specialized physiotherapy interventions plays a vital role in optimizing functional outcomes for patients affected by this rare form of Parkinson's disease from an early age.",create
"This is the case of a 6-hours-old female neonate infant who was referred from a district hospital in Nairobi for further evaluation and management of an abdominal mass. The mother of the baby, Mrs. Achieng, was a 25-year-old primipara of Kenyan nationality, with no known chronic medical conditions. There were no consanguinity or inbreeding factors reported in the family history. The antenatal care received by Mrs. Achieng during her pregnancy was suboptimal, with irregular follow-ups and missed appointments.  Mrs. Achieng's pregnancy progressed to term at 38 weeks gestation without any significant complications reported throughout gestational age (GA). However, she did not receive any routine ultrasounds during her prenatal visits due to financial constraints, limiting the early detection of potential abnormalities.  During labor, Mrs. Achieng's membrane ruptured spontaneously with clear amniotic fluid discharge and no signs of infection were observed upon admission to the district hospital.  The delivery process took place naturally without any complications reported; however, immediately after birth, it became evident that there was a large visible abdominal mass protruding through an anterior abdominal wall defect just below the umbilicus region.  The newborn girl appeared generally well-appearing aside from this notable abnormality on physical examination - displaying appropriate muscle tone and respiratory effort but remained slightly jaundiced.  Upon arrival at our tertiary care facility in Nairobi, a detailed assessment was performed by our pediatric surgical team to evaluate this congenital anomaly further.  Further investigations revealed that there were no associated chromosomal abnormalities based on karyotype analysis performed on peripheral blood samples collected from both parents and the neonate for comparative analysis.  An ultrasound examination confirmed the presence of multiple loops of distended bowel within what appeared to be an omphalocele sac measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter. Additionally noted were mild signs suggestive of liver involvement within this herniated mass.  Given the size of the omphalocele and potential associated complications, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to plan for further management and care. The primary considerations included preventing infection, maintaining thermoregulation, monitoring for respiratory compromise, and assessing associated anomalies.  Initial stabilizing measures were undertaken to ensure optimal conditions for surgical intervention within the first 48 hours after birth. These interventions included strict temperature control using an incubator, institution of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection within the omphalocele sac, and consultation with our neonatal intensive care team for continuous monitoring of vital signs.  Parental counseling was offered regarding possible outcomes and long-term prognosis in these cases. Surgical repair of the abdominal wall defect was planned once stable hemodynamic parameters were achieved in preparation for future definitive surgical intervention to correct this anatomical abnormality.  Monitoring continued over subsequent days with close observations for any signs of compromised bowel circulation or deterioration in clinical status requiring immediate intervention.  In conclusion, this is a case involving a female neonate who presented with an abdominal wall malformation consistent with an omphalocele. Despite suboptimal antenatal care received by Mrs. Achieng during her pregnancy, prompt referral allowed timely assessment leading to appropriate initial stabilization measures before embarking on definitive surgical correction required in such cases. Close follow-up is crucial given potential long-term implications associated with complex congenital anomalies like this one. ",create
"Title: A 42-year-old Male Presenting with Progressive Neurological Symptoms and Urinary Dysfunction  Introduction: This case presentation describes the admission of a 42-year-old male patient to our department with a two-month history of lumbosacral radiculopathy and associated low back pain. Despite initial treatment with NSAIDs, the patient experienced partial remission only. Two weeks prior to admission, he began suffering from rapidly progressing bilateral lower limb weakness along with urinary dysfunction. This report outlines the clinical findings and subsequent management of this patient.  Case Presentation: Mr. T, a previously healthy 42-year-old male, presented to our emergency department complaining of worsening bilateral leg weakness over two months. Initially, he experienced episodic pain radiating from his lower back to the right leg, which responded partially to NSAIDs prescribed by his primary care physician.  The past medical history was unremarkable - Mr. T had no previous history of chronic illnesses or surgeries. He did not report any trauma or engaging in repetitive strenuous activities involving his back before symptom onset.  Two weeks before presenting at our facility, Mr. T's symptoms rapidly worsened as he developed progressive weakness in both legs accompanied by sensory changes below his umbilicus level. Furthermore, he started experiencing difficulties controlling urination and complained of decreased sensation around the genital area.  On examination upon admission, Mr.T was found to be in moderate general condition (Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score: 70%). Neurologically, he displayed significant right paraparesis (3/5) compared to mild left paraparesis (4/5). Sensory examination revealed a sensory level below the umbilical region bilaterally.  Further neurological assessment demonstrated impaired genitourinary function characterized by urinary retention requiring intermittent catheterization for emptying bladder completely.  Investigations: A panel of laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), renal and liver function tests, and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were unremarkable.  Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed evidence of a disc herniation at the L4-L5 level with significant compression of the right-sided nerve roots.  Treatment and Management: Mr. T was initially managed conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, activity modification, physiotherapy, and use of braces to support his lumbar region. However, this approach provided only limited relief.  Considering his progressive neurological symptoms along with urinary dysfunction suggestive of cauda equina syndrome (CES), Mr. T was referred to a spinal surgeon for further evaluation and management options.  The surgical consultation resulted in the decision to proceed with an emergent decompressive laminectomy at the L4-L5 intervertebral level to relieve nerve compression caused by the disc herniation. The surgery was performed successfully without any intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively, Mr. T remained under close observation for any signs of improvement or complications such as infection or cerebrospinal fluid leak. Physical therapy was promptly initiated to aid in regaining muscle strength and function while promoting his overall rehabilitation process.  Follow-up: Over a two-week hospital stay post-surgery, Mr.T demonstrated progressive improvement in motor power bilaterally over time; consequently leading to complete resolution of paraparesis. Moreover, he reported significant pain relief along with improved genitourinary control during follow-up assessments by our rehabilitation team members.  Discussion: This case highlights an atypical presentation of lumbosacral radiculopathy complicated by CES as illustrated by rapidly progressive bilateral lower limb weakness accompanied by genitourinary disturbances secondary to disc herniation at the L4-L5 intervertebral level. Prompt surgical intervention alongside postoperative supportive management allowed for full motor recovery in this patient.  Conclusion: Early recognition and appropriate management are vital for patients presenting with lumbosacral radiculopathy and worsening neurological symptoms. In cases exhibiting rapidly progressive lower limb weakness and genitourinary dysfunction, consideration should be given to CES, mandating emergent surgical intervention to prevent permanent neurological deficits.",create
"Title: A Case of Unexplained Congenital Anomalies: A Nurse's Perspective  Introduction: The patient, a 10-month-old girl, presented to our out-patient clinic due to a combination of developmental anomalies identified since birth. Concerns arose as her parents noticed that she experienced difficulty opening her mouth widely during crying or feeding episodes. Both parents were unrelated, and the child was their second born. There was no prior family history of congenital abnormalities or similar medical conditions. The pregnancy, birth, and neonatal periods were unremarkable. This case report aims to analyze the clinical presentation, conduct diagnostic assessments, and suggest possible etiologies related to the observed congenital anomalies.  Clinical Presentation: Upon examination, the infant appeared notably irritable but otherwise presented with normal vital signs including an afebrile status and absence of jaundice or cyanosis. Motor tone seemed appropriate for age as she displayed normotonus without any evident respiratory distress.  Physical Findings: 1. Micrognathia: The patient exhibited micrognathia characterized by an underdeveloped mandible resulting in orthognathic appearance. 2. High Arched Palate: Additionally, she had a high-arched palate along with dental crowding within her oral cavity. 3. Hearing Impairment: Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test indicated bilateral hearing impairment. 4. Cardiac Murmurs: Auscultation revealed abnormal heart sounds suggestive of cardiac murmurs.  Diagnostic Assessments: To further evaluate the patient's condition and establish potential underlying causes for her presenting symptoms:  1) Genetic Testing - Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA): A CMA will be conducted to identify any chromosomal imbalances like deletions or rearrangements that could contribute to her multisystemic involvement.  2) Imaging Studies - Cranial CT Scan & MRI:    - Cranial CT Scan will assess the craniofacial structure and provide detailed insights into the patient's micrognathia.    - MRI will be performed to evaluate the overall brain morphology, ruling out any intracranial abnormalities that may correlate with her clinical symptoms.  3) Audiology Assessment: Further audiological assessments, including an auditory brainstem response (ABR) test and pure-tone audiometry, will be conducted to assess the severity of her hearing impairment.  4) Cardiology Evaluation: An echocardiogram will be ordered for comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular anomalies correlating with cardiac murmurs detected during auscultation. This assessment will help identify any structural cardiac defects or potential associations with other systemic disorders.  Discussion: Given this infant's constellation of findings, our differential diagnosis includes a range of possible etiologies such as:  1. Chromosomal Abnormalities:    a. Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome): Although there is no significant family history, Down syndrome can occur sporadically due to non-disjunction during meiosis.    b. Other Microdeletion Syndromes: Deletions involving specific loci on various chromosomes may account for multiple congenital anomalies.  2. Teratogenic Exposures: Maternal exposure to teratogenic substances like alcohol or certain medications during pregnancy can result in congenital malformations.  3. Environmental Factors: In some cases, environmental factors such as maternal infection or exposure to radiation could contribute to developmental abnormalities in utero.  Conclusion: The presented clinical case illustrates an infant girl exhibiting multiple congenital anomalies without any apparent family history of similar conditions. The physical examination revealed micrognathia, high-arched palate, hearing impairment, and cardiac murmurs among other features. Extensive diagnostic investigations including genetic testing (CMA), imaging studies (cranial CT scan & MRI), audiology assessments, and cardiological evaluations have been planned to identify the underlying cause(s). Further research and analysis will be required to make an accurate diagnosis, considering potential chromosomal abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and environmental factors. The goal is to provide appropriate therapeutic interventions and support for the patient based on their individual needs.",create
"Patient KS, a 65-year-old man, was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of XYZ General Hospital due to severe respiratory distress. He had a known medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. His family reported that he had been experiencing progressive shortness of breath over the past week along with persistent cough and increased sputum production.  On physical examination, Patient KS appeared pale with labored breathing. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 160/90 mmHg; heart rate, 100 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 28 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation on room air, 88%. Auscultation revealed diminished bilateral breath sounds with coarse crackles and wheezing throughout all lung fields. There were no murmurs or extra heart sounds on cardiac examination.  Laboratory investigations showed elevated white blood cell count (15.6 x10^9/L) with predominant neutrophils and high C-reactive protein levels (25 mg/dL). Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <200 mmHg. An electrocardiogram revealed evidence of right atrial enlargement but was otherwise unremarkable.  Chest radiograph displayed hyperinflation consistent with COPD exacerbation along with diffuse patchy opacities in both lung fields suggestive of pneumonia or acute bronchitis superimposed on the underlying pulmonary pathology.  Infection markers including sputum cultures and gram stain tests were collected for further evaluation while empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated against common pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia in patients like KS. He was also started on bronchodilators including nebulized beta-agonists and anticholinergics for symptomatic relief as well as systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation associated with COPD exacerbation.  Due to the severity of his symptoms, Patient KS required close monitoring and supplemental oxygen therapy via a high-flow nasal cannula to maintain adequate oxygenation. In addition, he was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to improve his ventilatory status and alleviate respiratory distress.  Over the course of his hospitalization, Patient KS showed gradual improvement with decreased dyspnea and improved oxygen saturation. Serial chest radiographs revealed clearing opacities paralleling clinical progress. Follow-up laboratory investigations indicated decreasing white blood cell count and declining C-reactive protein levels.  Patient KS's antibiotic regimen was modified according to sensitivity results from sputum cultures, targeting specific pathogens responsible for causing his pneumonia. He completed a 10-day course of antibiotics along with regular physiotherapy sessions that included breathing exercises and mucolytics for optimal airway clearance.  After 14 days in the MICU, Patient KS was stable enough for transfer to a general medical ward where further rehabilitation under closer observation could be carried out before discharge planning.  This case illustrates how an elderly patient with underlying COPD presented with worsening respiratory symptoms consistent with acute exacerbation compounded by concurrent pulmonary infection necessitating intensive care management including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotic therapy against community-acquired pneumonia pathogens amid appropriate supportive care measures such as oxygen supplementation and NIV assistance. With timely intervention and diligent monitoring by a multi-disciplinary team involving physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists,and physiotherapists among others; successful recovery can be achieved leading towards subsequent inpatient rehabilitation followed by eventual discharge back into community-based care settings or home environment provided proper healthcare follow-up is ensured for continued wellbeing maintenance.",create
"Patient X is a 34-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, who presented to the Greenfield Hospital at 35 weeks' gestation. She was referred from a local clinic due to concerns of preterm labor. Patient X has a history of two previous cesarean deliveries and had undergone an abdomen myomectomy in the past. Her current pregnancy was unremarkable up until this point.  Upon arrival at the hospital, Patient X complained of intermittent lower abdominal pain and pressure for the past two days. She denied any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid. There were no signs or symptoms suggestive of active labor at that time, and fetal movements were reported as normal.  Given her previous surgical history and concerns for preterm delivery, an ultrasound was performed to assess fetal well-being and evaluate cervical length. The ultrasound confirmed a singleton pregnancy with no significant abnormalities noted. However, cervical length was found to be shortened to just 1 centimeter.  Considering Patient X's risk factors for preterm birth along with clinical findings suggestive of potential uterine rupture or placental abruption, it was decided that an emergency cesarean section would be necessary.  Prior to proceeding with surgery, Patient X underwent screening for COVID-19 due to known close contact with a confirmed case. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for RT-PCR testing following established protocols recommended by health authorities.  Although she denied any symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection such as cough, fever, shortness of breath or loss of taste/smell sensations), there was apprehension about potential exposure given their interaction with an infected individual during recent social interactions.  Results from the COVID-19 test were not available immediately; hence all necessary precautions were taken in order to protect both healthcare workers and other patients in the operating room setting.  Patient X received appropriate counseling regarding these safety measures as well as explanations surrounding reasons behind taking extra precautions, ensuring a safe delivery process for her and her child.  Following the decision for an emergency cesarean delivery, Patient X was swiftly transferred to the operating room. In accordance with standard protocol, she received spinal anesthesia and the surgery commenced.  The procedure was uneventful; however, mild adhesions from previous surgeries were encountered during the surgical exploration. These challenges were overcome efficiently by the surgical team. A healthy baby boy weighing 2.9 kilograms was delivered without complications and promptly handed over to the neonatology team for assessment.  Upon completion of surgery, Patient X was moved to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring of vital signs and recovery from anesthesia. She required no further interventions in PACU and her pain was well-managed with analgesics such as oral paracetamol.  Throughout patient X's post-operative recovery on the maternity ward, she remained afebrile with stable vital signs. Adequate pain relief measures were continued while providing appropriate wound care guidance specifically addressing postsurgical incisional care to prevent any infections or complications related to operative sites.  Patient X's subsequent COVID-19 test results returned negative reassuring both herself and healthcare providers of their safety during this period of uncertainties posed by this pandemic.  Close postoperative follow-up was then provided ensuring favorable progress in terms of physical well-being along with breastfeeding support education during their stay at our facility before being discharged home four days after delivery thriving in good health conditions along with her newly born son under adequate outpatient clinical vigilance arrangements made as per patients' scheduled visits upon bereavement which ensured comfortable continuation towards resuming normal daily life routines while focusing on maintaining optimal maternal-infant bond strengthening respective family relationships while acknowledging prolonged impact & versatility contributed by major life transitions commonly experienced through childbirth processes utilizing comprehensive individualized continuous holistic patient-centered intervention strategies contributing positively towards achieving long term positive outcomes & satisfying tailored therapeutic goals according to patients' matching healthcare needs.",create
"A 50-year-old male, Mr. Johnson, presented to St. Luke's Hospital in a suburban area with a chief complaint of persistent abdominal discomfort for the past six months. Mr. Johnson worked as an accountant and was happily married with two grown-up children.  He described the pain as a constant dull ache in the right hypochondriac region, which had gradually worsened over time. Despite taking over-the-counter analgesics, Mr. Johnson found minimal relief from the discomfort.  During his initial evaluation, he also mentioned noticing a mass in his abdomen for about five months. He claimed that it remained relatively unchanged in size during that period but became increasingly bothersome due to its presence.  Aside from these symptoms, Mr. Johnson reported experiencing dark-colored stools and progressive weight loss over the course of six months. Although he had no history of vomiting or diarrhea, he did admit to occasionally passing flatulence characterized by an unpleasant odor similar to rotting matter.  The patient denied any association between his symptoms and abdominal distension or early morning bowel movements specifically related to diarrhea.  Concerned by these developments, Mr. Johnson decided it was time to consult with medical professionals regarding his condition at St Luke's Hospital Surgical Outpatient Department (SOPD).  Upon further investigation at SOPD, physical examination revealed tenderness in the right hypochondriac region upon palpation but no significant distension or masses felt elsewhere within the abdomen upon assessment.  Understanding potential underlying causes for such symptoms required comprehensive examination and testing beyond physical observation alone.  As part of their diagnostic approach at SOPD, laboratory investigations were initiated including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests(LFTs), urea & electrolytes(U&E), as well as tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA). Results returned raised levels of CEA but showed no other alarming abnormalities within normal values ​​for CBC or U&E profiles except slightly elevated liver enzymes.  The surgical team decided that further imaging studies were pivotal to making an accurate diagnosis. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing an irregular mass in the right lobe of the liver approximately 8 cm in diameter, accompanied by mild hepatomegaly.  To obtain a clearer understanding of the pathology, a subsequent CT scan with contrast was conducted. Imaging revealed a solitary mass consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confined within the right hepatic lobe but encroaching on surrounding structures.  Given these findings, Mr. Johnson's case was presented during a multidisciplinary team meeting including gastroenterologists, hepatologists,surgeons,radiologists and oncologists to determine the best approach for his management.  After thorough discussion and collaboration among specialists involved in Mr. Johnson's care, it was decided that surgical intervention would offer him the most promising outcome based on tumor characteristics and patient fitness for surgery.  Henceforth plans were formulated for prompt referral to a specialized center capable of resecting HCC tumors either through hepatectomy or transplantation procedures depending upon further verification through invasive biopsy sampling procedures like transjugular liver biopsy(TJLB).  In conclusion, Mr. Johnson's case presents as yet another complex scenario requiring diligent attention from healthcare professionals specializing in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Effective management necessitates not only gathering comprehensive clinical history but also conducting necessary laboratory investigations alongside standard imaging modalities to achieve accurate diagnoses ultimately guiding future therapeutic interventions tailored towards optimal patient outcomes.",create
"Patient Case: A 35-year-old male presents with fatigue, abdominal pain, and persistent low-grade fever. Physical examination reveals pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade II splenomegaly. Further investigations reveal abnormal blood values including an elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 75,000/mm³. Peripheral neutrophils are found to be 40,500/mm³; hemoglobin is within normal range at 13.2g/dl; and platelets appear slightly decreased at 150,000/mm³.  The patient's peripheral blood smear reveals leukocytosis along with a significant number of immature myeloid precursors. Although the percentage of blasts is not abnormally high at only 2%, further analysis uncovers a chromosomal abnormality in the form of t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement.  History indicates that this previously healthy individual experienced worsening fatigue over several weeks along with intermittent low-grade fever and abdominal pain localized to the left upper quadrant. The pain had gradually intensified but was not associated with specific food or physical activity.  Upon initial assessment in the outpatient clinic setting, vital signs including temperature and heart rate were within normal limits while blood pressure measured slightly elevated at 135/85 mmHg. Physical examination revealed noticeable pallor which then prompted further investigation into potential causes for anemia.  Laboratory findings indicated both leukocytosis (abnormal increase in WBC) as well as thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelet count). These abnormalities pointed towards a possible hematological disorder such as chronic leukemia or myeloproliferative neoplasm.  To determine the underlying condition causing these symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, an extensive evaluation was initiated. Based on the presence of hepatosplenomegaly together with leukocytosis predominantly affecting granulocytes (neutrophils), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) quickly emerged as a primary differential diagnosis.  Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis came via cytogenetic studies, showing the presence of t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement. This molecular alteration is commonly associated with CML and represents a fusion gene formed by breakage at chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in an abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion protein.  The patient was instructed to undergo further evaluation to establish prognostic factors such as baseline organ function and identification of additional molecular mutations that may provide insights into potential targeted therapies. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were scheduled to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation of the disease burden including percentage of blasts present in the marrow.  Following definitive confirmation, the patient will receive an individualized treatment plan aimed at managing chronic myeloid leukemia. This typically involves targeted therapy utilizing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to inhibit activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Regular monitoring involving blood counts, cytogenetics, and molecular response through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be implemented to assess response to therapy over time.  In conclusion, this case highlights a 35-year-old male presenting with fatigue, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly along with hematological abnormalities consisting of leukocytosis predominantly affecting neutrophils. Further analysis revealed t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement confirming chronic myeloid leukemia. The focus will now shift towards initiating appropriate treatment strategies while considering additional prognostic factors for optimal management moving forward. The patient, a 58-year-old woman, visits the outpatient clinic complaining of fatigue, low-grade fever, and abdominal pain. Her medical history reveals an underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which she has been receiving treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Physical examination shows pallor, hepatomegaly, and grade II splenomegaly.  Laboratory investigations are initiated to evaluate her symptoms comprehensively. The white blood cell count is found to be significantly elevated at 55,000/mm³. Peripheral neutrophils are increased at 30,500/mm³ while hemoglobin level remains within normal range at 12.8g/dl. Platelet count is slightly decreased at 140,000/mm³.  A peripheral blood smear is examined revealing leukocytosis accompanied by a notable number of immature myeloid precursors suggestive of myeloid hyperplasia. Further evaluation discloses the presence of blasts comprising approximately 10% of all nucleated cells observed on the smear.  Given these findings in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and medical history of SLE as an underlying autoimmune condition with potential hematologic involvement, suspicion arose towards acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developing secondary to her pre-existing immune disorder.  To confirm this suspicion and acquire more definitive diagnostic information regarding disease type and risk stratification features required for appropriate therapeutic planning, additional investigations were ordered including flow cytometry analysis to characterize immunophenotypic markers expressed on leukemic blasts.  The patient reported the gradual onset of fatigue over several months accompanied by recurring low-grade fever episodes that did not respond well to antipyretics or anti-inflammatory medications prescribed for her lupus management. Abdominal pain localized primarily in the right upper quadrant had emerged recently along with progressive enlargement noticed in both liver and spleen size during self-examination.  Preliminary assessment within the clinic setting indicated stable vital signs within acceptable ranges. Tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant, along with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, prompted further evaluation.  Considering this patient's compromised immune system due to her underlying SLE and prolonged corticosteroid use, the presence of a hematologic malignancy is concerning. The combination of fatigue, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis with an increased blast percentage on peripheral smear points towards a secondary AML arising from clonal evolution during the course of SLE.  Once diagnosed definitively with secondary AML associated with SLE, she will require specialized management incorporating factors such as disease subtype classification (based on flow cytometry analysis), molecular profiling for risk stratification purposes (considering mutations within key genes implicated in AML pathogenesis), and assessment of baseline organ function.  The treatment approach will be determined based on these factors along with careful considerations given to potential drug-drug interactions between chemotherapy agents used for managing AML and her ongoing immunosuppressive therapy aimed at controlling lupus activity. Constant monitoring through regular blood counts and assessment of response using bone marrow evaluation will guide treatment adjustments as needed according to established protocols for her specific disease subtype.  In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates a 58-year-old woman presenting symptoms including fatigue, low-grade fever, abdominal pain accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly along with hematologic abnormalities consisting of leukocytosis predominantly affecting neutrophils. The suspicion leans towards a diagnosis of secondary acute myeloid leukemia resulting from underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. Moving forward entails confirming the diagnosis through additional investigations while considering personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to address both conditions effectively without compromising overall patient well-being.",create
"The University Cardiac Hospital, dubbed as the heart center of Alphaville, was officially inaugurated in November of 2005. In 1996, when the patient was six years old, he became part of a selected group of children who received generous financial aid to travel abroad for treatment of a congenital heart defect. At that time, he was diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly and was prepared for surgery.  Upon examination in our hospital's renowned Pediatric Cardiology department, various classic symptoms associated with Ebstein's anomaly were observed in the patient. Clinical findings included cyanosis, exercise intolerance, and palpitations triggered by physical exertion. Additionally present were peripheral edema and hepatomegaly due to right-sided heart failure.  Further diagnostic investigation confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly - a rare congenital malformation characterized by downward displacement and dysfunction of the tricuspid valve leaflets leading to atrialization or ""atrialized"" portioning of the right ventricle (RV). Echocardiography revealed tricuspid regurgitation with severe RV dilatation but preserved left ventricular function.  Surgical intervention was deemed necessary as this condition posed significant risks to the patient's cardiac health. Preoperatively extensive counseling regarding potential complications including arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation), residual tricuspid insufficiency requiring reoperation during adulthood or attempted medical management thereof was provided.  On April 15th, 1996, at age ten; the patient underwent corrective surgery under general anesthesia with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring in our state-of-the-art operating theater at University Cardiac Hospital. A median sternotomy incision allowed us access to conduct an extensive surgical procedure under cardiopulmonary bypass utilizing moderate hypothermia through systemic inflow occlusion technique.  During surgery, we noted marked tricuspid valve abnormalities consistent with Ebstein's anomaly, with significant downward displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets. The anterior leaflet was relatively well-formed though tethered to the atrialized RV.  Following extensive dissection, we performed an excision of redundant abnormal tricuspid valve tissue, with sizing and insertion of an orthotopic tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring for enhanced coaptation. The right atrium was then repaired through a suture closure of the interatrial communication.  Upon sternotomy closure without complications following guidelines specific to our hospital protocol, standard postoperative management for major cardiac surgical procedures ensued. We carefully monitored vital signs including blood pressure and cardiac rhythms while maintaining adequate pain control through a multimodal analgesic regimen.  Effective recovery was observed in our patient within the first 48 hours after surgery. Serial transthoracic echocardiograms acquired over subsequent days showed satisfactory hemodynamics without any residual leaks or significant ventricular dysfunction. His oxygen saturation improved remarkably from preoperative values in room air into the low 90% range postoperatively - evidencing successful intervention on his cyanotic congenital heart defect.  The patient remained under close clinical surveillance by our multidisciplinary heart care team during postoperative hospitalization, which lasted for two weeks until his discharge on April 30th, 1996. A comprehensive plan involving regular outpatient visits as part of long-term follow-up care has been established to ensure continued monitoring and optimize outcome measures concerning functionality and quality of life moving forward.  Through this successful surgical intervention at University Cardiac Hospital - equipped with cutting-edge technology, highly skilled healthcare professionals specializing in congenital heart diseases like Ebstein's anomaly - we strive to provide excellent care that promotes well-being for patients like this young boy who came seeking lifesaving treatment.",create
"Case Report: A 7-year-old boy from a rural area with chronic ulcers on the lower extremities  Introduction: This report presents the case of a 7-year-old boy, residing in a remote village, who was brought to our center for consultation regarding chronic ulcers on his lower extremities. The purpose of this report is to discuss his clinical presentation, medical history, and treatment associated with these persistent lesions.  Case Presentation: The patient, from a small farming village in rural Adams County, reported noticing painless but itchy nodules on both lower extremities four months ago. Over time, these nodules spread and evolved into indurated plaques accompanied by secondary ulceration. Despite conservative measures involving unspecified topical antibiotics and traditional remedies recommended by local healers for treating skin infections like leprosy or Buruli ulcer disease—such as herbal medicine—the lesions failed to heal.  Medical History: According to the patient's parents, he presented with good overall health prior to the onset of these ulcers. His immunization history is up-to-date for his age group. He did not have any recent febrile illnesses or exposure to contaminated water sources such as rivers notorious for harboring parasitic diseases.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination, multiple chronic ulcers were observed predominantly located on the distal aspects of both lower limbs below the knees. These well-defined ulcers showed evidence of tissue necrosis at their bases along with surrounding erythema and induration extending approximately five centimeters in diameter (Figure 1). No regional lymphadenopathy or systemic signs suggestive of infection were noted upon examination.  Investigations: To evaluate further and rule out potential etiologies contributing to these chronic non-healing ulcers on the child's lower limbs, various investigations were conducted:  1. Complete blood count (CBC): Within normal limits except mild anemia (Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL) 2. Blood smear for acid-fast bacilli: Negative 3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium leprae: Negative 4. Serological tests for other infections such as Buruli ulcer and endemic fungal diseases: Negative  Based on the clinical findings and negative investigations conducted, a final diagnosis of chronic non-healing ulcers of unknown etiology was established.  Management: Treatment of this patient consisted of a multidisciplinary approach that involved wound care, parent education, and local hygiene advice to prevent secondary infections:  1. Wound care: The ulcers were thoroughly cleansed with sterile saline followed by the application of topical antimicrobial ointment twice daily. 2. Dressings: Non-adherent dressings were utilized to promote granulation and prevent complications such as infection. 3. Systemic support: As anemic status was identified in the CBC results, iron supplementation was prescribed in consultation with a pediatrician. 4. Education and counseling: The child's parents were educated about proper wound care techniques, hygiene practices, and the importance of regular follow-up visits for close monitoring.  Follow-up: The patient's condition has been regularly monitored at our center every two weeks since initiation of treatment. After six weeks, significant improvement in terms of reduction in ulcer size and increased granulation tissue formation has been observed (Figure 2). The boy's general condition is stable without any sign/symptom suggestive of systemic involvement or superimposed infection.  Conclusion: This case highlights the diagnostic challenge encountered when faced with chronic non-healing ulcers within rural areas presenting limited access to healthcare facilities. Although further investigations are needed to identify the exact etiology behind these ulcers accurately, early recognition through careful history-taking and focused examinations can immensely contribute toward appropriate management planning leading to favorable outcomes.  Acknowledging resource constraints prevalent in rural settings emphasizes the importance of strengthening primary healthcare services by providing medical personnel equipped with knowledge regarding tropical skin diseases and chronic wound management techniques. Early diagnosis and intervention can play a crucial role in preventing long-term morbidity associated with neglected chronic ulcers, ultimately improving the overall quality of life for these underserved populations.",create
"A 56-year-old female attended the neurology outpatient department (OPD) in July 2021, and the intricate sequence of events following her diagnosis and subsequent management had captured our attention. The patient presented with a myriad of complaints, including dysphagia, nasal regurgitation upon eating, and dysarthria persisting for the past three days. While reviewing her medical history, it was apparent that she had no noteworthy prior illnesses or conditions except for occasional migraines.  Upon physical examination, the patient displayed intact cognitive functions with normal orientation and comprehension. She was fully alert and conscious throughout the evaluation process, reaching a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15/15. Her vital signs remained stable within normal limits: blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate at a regular rhythm of 78 beats per minute, respiration rate at a comfortable 16 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation maintained above 95% on room air.  As we delved deeper into her clinical presentation, additional symptoms began to surface during our comprehensive assessment. The patient revealed mild bilateral limb weakness along with occasional difficulty in swallowing solid foods over the past week. She also acknowledged experiencing intermittent nasal congestion concurrent with meal consumption.  Considering these new findings alongside her previous medical history and physical examination results prompted us to investigate further using supplementary diagnostic methods. Given her history of migraines coupled with recent cranial complaints related to swallowing difficulties and nasal regurgitation exclusively during eating episodes—in addition to deteriorating upper limb muscle strength—we suspected an underlying neuromuscular issue that warranted prompt attention.  To gain more insight into our patient's condition while corroborating our initial suspicions, we decided to conduct a series of investigations aligned with current guidelines for such clinical presentations encompassing neurological concerns:  1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Brain: A non-contrast MRI scan was performed to assess brain structures thoroughly and identify any potential abnormalities or lesions contributing to her symptoms. The MRI results displayed no significant evidence of intracranial pathology, ruling out concerns such as tumors, ischemic events, or hemorrhages.  2. Electromyography (EMG): By conducting an EMG study with nerve conduction studies (NCS), we could comprehensively evaluate the functionality of peripheral nerves and muscle responses. Our patient's EMG test revealed signs supporting a diagnosis of a probable lower motor neuron disorder affecting bulbar innervation—the branches involved in swallowing, speech muscles control, and upper limb movements.  With the culmination of these diagnostic investigations and the integration of our physical examination findings, we were able to formulate a preliminary working diagnosis for our patient—a neuromuscular condition involving her cranial nerves that resulted in dysphagia, nasal regurgitation upon eating, dysarthria progressing over three days duration.  Following this initial assessment phase culminating in our provisional diagnostic impression—understanding the importance of implementing various therapeutic modalities to manage underlying conditions—we embarked on outlining an individualized treatment plan tailored for our patient's specific needs. We sought input from various allied healthcare professionals including speech therapists specializing in dysphagia management and vocal rehabilitation experts proficient in addressing dysarthria—an integral component informing her quality of life post-treatment.  To ensure continuity in care provision for this intricate case involving neurological functioning with multifaceted symptomatology necessitating ongoing monitoring—thus potentially preventing further complications—we scheduled periodic follow-up visits scheduled at 3-month intervals initially while remaining open to modify appointment timings based on clinical response over time.  Overall, managing this imaginary patient's complex neuromuscular case required interprofessional collaboration encompassing both diagnostic evaluations as well as incorporating comprehensive therapeutic interventions tailored specifically to address her unique set of symptoms—ensuring optimized quality-of-life outcomes remain at the forefront throughout the continuum of care provision.",create
"Clinical Case: A 35-year-old male patient presented to our orthopedic clinic with bilateral hand deformities and functional limitations. The patient reported a medical history significant for an autoimmune disease, which had resulted in the amputations of several fingers on both hands. These amputations were performed approximately five years ago.  Upon physical examination, it became evident that the right hand had undergone extensive digit loss. Specifically, the index finger's metacarpal bone and the distal phalanges of both the second and fourth fingers were amputated. In addition, a careful evaluation of the left hand revealed similar deficiencies, with missing metacarpals of both the thumb and second finger and an amputation involving the proximal phalanx of the third finger.  In further assessing this patient's condition, an observation was made regarding a flexion deformity in the stump's proximal phalanx of his left third finger.  The patient described considerable difficulties executing daily activities that involved manual dexterity. Despite having managed relatively well since his surgeries by utilizing adaptive techniques with limited success, he now sought rehabilitation options to improve his overall hand function. His expressed goals included enhancing independence in self-care tasks such as grooming, using utensils during meals, managing household chores involving manipulation or grasping objects efficiently.  During a comprehensive assessment session conducted by our interdisciplinary team comprising occupational therapists and prosthetists specialized in upper limb rehabilitation consults, important contextual information was gathered to inform treatment planning for this individualized case.  Upon inquiry about psychosocial factors influencing adaptive functioning post-amputation surgery integration process five years ago — including coping mechanisms adopted within various social contexts throughout life — it became apparent that while initially supported emotionally during early recovery phases following surgery by family members who themselves adapted after encountering disabling conditions; he shared grappling experiences towards acceptance over time given subsequent changes experienced post-operatively (functionally manifested being encountered).  Based on these findings from evaluation and contextual understanding, a collaborative therapeutic approach was proposed involving a multifaceted intervention strategy, aimed at addressing the patient's functional limitations and improving overall quality of life.  The proposed treatment plan comprises several components. First, prosthetic options will be explored to compensate for the missing fingers. Customized prostheses will be designed to specifically address each hand's unique deficiencies, considering factors such as residual limb length and range of motion available. The patient will receive training from our prosthetists on how to effectively utilize these devices.  Parallelly, occupational therapy sessions will focus on restoring hand function through exercises targeting grip strength enhancement and finger movements. Therapeutic activities tailored to daily living tasks commonly performed by the patient will simulate real-life scenarios encountered in self-care or work environments.  Psychosocial support strategies form an integral part of this comprehensive approach designed for this patient. Individual counseling sessions led by our mental health professionals will help identify coping mechanisms suited specifically for managing emotional challenges arising from changes in body image perception and limitations faced due to limb loss.  This individualized multi-modal intervention aims at enabling this young male patient with comprehensive tools necessary towards reclaiming independence while fostering psychological resilience throughout his personalized rehabilitation journey — one that has evolved over time due to impacts traced back to both genetic predispositions as well as disease onset trajectories intertwined within his broader contextual influences underlying life experiences shaping identities across time horizons spanned until now — inviting diversely embraced narratives beyond clinical records decoding reduced upper limb functioning statements that otherwise remain only glimpsed upon through prior read initial medical documentation revealing case details until recent interdisciplinarily facilitated consultation consultations now laid foundationally envisioned prognosis-oriented interventions forecasting future implementations generating recovery pathways guiding expertly guided prioritized directions presently poised envisioning uncovered personalize towards reconnecting unexposed dormant dimensions underpinning innate potentials waiting traversals elegantly reinforcing regarding rediscovered capability awakenings yet come...",create
"Case 2: Mrs. B, a 32-year-old primigravida, was admitted to the hospital at 17 weeks gestation with a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). She had recently been diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis (MS) during an evaluation for her long-standing symptoms. Mrs. B had experienced symptoms like exertional dyspnea and occasional palpitations since adolescence.  Upon admission, an echocardiogram was performed revealing similar findings to Case 1. The MVA measured 1.2 cm^2, indicating severe stenosis; the ejection fraction calculated at 58%, within normal limits; and a moderately dilated left atrium measuring 56-61mm in diameter without evidence of pulmonary hypertension.  Recognizing the complexity of Mrs. B's condition, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) composed of a cardiologist specialized in valvular diseases, cardiothoracic surgeon, obstetricians, and anesthesiologist was convened to outline the best management approach for both mother and fetus.  The cardiology team identified several challenges specific to Mrs. B's case due to her pregnancy state and fragile cardiac status. Mitral stenosis imposes hemodynamic stress during pregnancy as increased blood volume further strains the compromised valve apparatus. The MDT determined that close monitoring was crucial throughout gestation to detect any worsening cardiac function or complications promptly.  Based on shared decision-making between Mrs. B and her healthcare providers, it was agreed upon that medical management would be initially attempted before considering valvular intervention if necessary later in pregnancy or postpartum.  To optimize maternal wellbeing during gestation, medical therapy consisted primarily of beta-blockers and diuretics along with regular follow-up visits for careful assessment of symptoms progression while mitigating potential teratogenic effects on fetal development.  In addition to addressing maternal cardiac concerns promptly, obstetricians closely monitored fetal growth and wellbeing. Serial ultrasounds were scheduled to assess the fetus for any growth restrictions, as well as evaluate and manage the potential risks associated with maternal medications.  The anesthesiologist played a key role in preparing for the intricate balance between providing adequate analgesia during labor and delivery of Mrs. B's child while ensuring hemodynamic stability. An epidural analgesic technique was planned to minimize stress-related fluctuations in cardiac output while maintaining adequate pain relief during labor.  Mrs. B's antenatal care also included patient education sessions aimed at assisting her in recognizing signs of worsening symptoms, emphasizing the importance of adherence to prescribed medications, ensuring regular follow-up appointments, and understanding when immediate medical attention was required.  As Mrs. B embarked on her first pregnancy journey with compromised cardiac function, collaborative healthcare decision-making paved the way for comprehensive management throughout this unique clinical scenario involving RHD and severe MS in pregnancy. The multidisciplinary team approach facilitated tailored interventions that would optimize both maternal and fetal outcomes while addressing potential risks associated with this complex condition.  Throughout Mrs. B's entire pregnancy journey, vigilance remained paramount as each member of the MDT worked hand-in-hand to ensure meticulous monitoring to detect any deviations from planned management swiftly—all with a shared objective: achieving a successful outcome for both mother and baby in light of their challenging circumstances. At 36 weeks gestation, Mrs. B presented to the hospital with worsening dyspnea and fatigue. The MDT expedited her evaluation to determine the cause of her sudden deterioration. An echocardiogram revealed a significant decrease in the mitral valve area, now measuring 0.8 cm^2, indicating a critical exacerbation of mitral stenosis.  Recognizing the urgency of Mrs. B's deteriorating cardiac function and assessing that conservative medical therapy was no longer sufficient for her condition, the MDT recommended an emergent valve intervention.  After careful consideration of both maternal and fetal risks, it was decided that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty would be performed as an immediate intervention to alleviate her symptoms and improve cardiac function while minimizing invasiveness.  The cardiothoracic surgeon collaborated closely with interventional cardiologists to ensure optimal procedural planning while considering Mrs. B's pregnancy status. A multidisciplinary discussion also involved neonatologists who briefed Mrs. B on potential preterm delivery implications should urgent delivery be necessary during or following the procedure.  Under general anesthesia in a hybrid operating room equipped with advanced monitoring capabilities and neonatal resuscitation equipment, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty was successfully carried out by skilled interventional cardiologists using fluoroscopic guidance.  During this delicate procedure, a deflated balloon catheter was threaded through peripheral vasculature until positioned across the stenotic mitral valve leaflets. Subsequently, dilation occurred as inflation of the balloon increased mitral valve area to approximately 1.5 cm^2—significantly improving hemodynamic parameters immediately noticeable on postprocedure echocardiography.  Mrs. B experienced substantial relief from dyspnea almost immediately after intervention while demonstrating improved oxygen saturation levels during subsequent assessment sessions—a tremendous testament to multidisciplinary collaboration within this complex clinical scenario.  Postprocedure management involved close observation in a specialized cardiac care unit equipped to provide intensive care for both mother and fetus. The obstetric team ensured continuous fetal monitoring, evaluating non-stress tests and assessing amniotic fluid volume regularly.  Gradually, Mrs. B's symptoms improved, allowing her to regain strength and anticipate a vaginal delivery at term. Multidisciplinary care plans included regular consultations with anesthesiologists to discuss optimal pain management strategies during labor while ensuring maternal hemodynamic stability.  At 39 weeks gestation, Mrs. B went into spontaneous labor and achieved a successful vaginal delivery under the watchful eyes of the multidisciplinary team. An epidural analgesic technique was employed as planned earlier during pregnancy, providing effective pain relief while carefully considering maternal- fetal well-being throughout the process.  Both mother and baby were closely monitored intra- and postpartum for any signs of cardiac decompensation or complications associated with childbirth. Fortunately, their recovery remained uneventful under the coordinated care provided by the collective efforts of all involved specialties.  This comprehensive clinical case exemplifies how collaborative decision-making utilizing a diverse MDT facilitated prompt recognition, investigation, management escalation when necessary regarding cardiac deterioration in a pregnant woman with RHD complicated by severe mitral stenosis. Despite numerous challenges along the way, Mrs. B received exceptional multidisciplinary care that aimed at safeguarding her health while optimizing outcomes for both mother and child—a testament to expertise-focused teamwork within modern healthcare settings.

"We present a case of a 58-year-old male who arrived at the emergency department of St. Joseph's Hospital, Toronto, Canada. He was referred from his primary care physician's office due to ongoing abdominal pain. The patient reported experiencing a persistent throbbing sensation in the lower right abdomen for the past four months. Although initially mild, the pain has progressively increased in intensity over time.  The patient denied any associated symptoms such as vomiting or changes in bowel habits. He also confirmed that he hadn't noticed any significant weight loss or changes in appetite during this period. As his discomfort persisted, he sought medical attention before being referred to our hospital.  Upon further inquiry, it was revealed that this gentleman had been hospitalized twice previously due to similar complaints and had received antibiotics and analgesics without substantial relief. Due to the lack of improvement with conservative management, he was transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital for further evaluation and intervention.  A comprehensive physical examination revealed tenderness upon palpation in the right iliac fossa region. Medical history analysis uncovered no chronic diseases or prior surgeries related to abdominal conditions nor any significant family medical history pertaining to similar presentations.  Given his clinical presentation and previous inconclusive investigations, an ultrasound study was performed on-site by our radiology team during his visit at our institution. The results were revealing – they demonstrated a considerable cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the medial aspect of the ascending colon resembling a sausage-like appearance.  Given these concerning findings on imaging studies and considering his persistent symptoms despite prior treatment attempts elsewhere, surgical consultation was initiated promptly after confirmation of these findings by radiologists.  The patient underwent further diagnostic workup including laboratory tests and preoperative preparation for urgent surgery following discussions with both general surgeons and colorectal specialists involved in his care management plan at St Joseph's Hospital.  During exploratory laparotomy surgery under general anesthesia, our surgical team discovered an enlarged cystic structure adherent near the right iliac fossa, which extended superiorly towards the ascending colon. Excision of the cystic mass was performed in its entirety, and subsequent histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of diverticular abscess with colonic involvement.  Postoperatively, the patient's recovery was uncomplicated, and his abdominal pain significantly improved. He was started on an appropriate course of antibiotics to address any potential residual infection post-surgery. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor his progress closely.  In conclusion, this case presents a 58-year-old male who experienced progressive throbbing lower right abdominal pain over several months. Despite previous attempts with standard medical management elsewhere, further investigations revealed a large cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the ascending colon. Surgical intervention led to successful excision and subsequent pathology confirmation of a diverticular abscess with colonic involvement. The patient is currently recovering well under postoperative care at St Joseph's Hospital's surgical ward with plans for close monitoring during upcoming follow-up appointments.

"Case: A 55-year-old divorced male presented to the department of neurology with a chief complaint of gradually worsening weakness in his right leg over the past six months. The patient also complained of occasional tingling sensations and numbness in his right foot. He reported experiencing muscle cramps and stiffness, which were exacerbated with physical activity.  The patient denied any history of headache, dizziness, ear discharge, trauma, or any other associated symptoms. There was no fever, unintentional weight loss, visible bleeding or pus discharge from the affected leg. Additionally, there was no history of smoking or substance abuse.  Upon further questioning, the patient revealed that he had recently noticed difficulty in initiating movements such as climbing stairs and standing up from a chair using his right leg. Although he did not experience pain in his lower back or neck area radiating down to his leg(s), he recalled having occasional lower back discomfort after prolonged periods of sitting.  The personal history explored significant episodes involving prolonged sitting at work due to sedentary desk jobs for several years leading up to this presentation as well as a relatively inactive lifestyle overall. As an accountant who spent most hours seated behind a desk without regular exercise routines or physical activities outside work.  Physical examination revealed diminished strength and muscle volume in the right quadriceps compared to the left side. Sensory examination demonstrated decreased pinprick sensation along the lateral aspect of the right calf and foot compared to the contralateral side. Deep tendon reflexes were normal bilaterally with no evidence for clonus or pathological reflexes detected during testing.  Based on these findings, an initial impression raising suspicion towards nerve entrapment syndrome (such as sciatica) was considered during assessment considering clinical manifestations consistent with this condition – unilateral lower extremity weakness associated with sensory disturbances predominantly affecting one dermatome corresponding anatomically over posterior part lateral aspect foot/calf area with absence suggesting nerve root impingement at lumbar level typically L5 or S1 level.  Further evaluation was proposed to establish the diagnosis. This would include a thorough neurological examination, an electromyography (EMG) study to assess nerve conduction across the leg, and imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine to investigate any potential structural abnormalities causing nerve compression.  The patient was counseled on lifestyle modifications emphasizing regular physical exercise, particularly incorporating spine-strengthening/stretching exercises with postural advice regarding maintaining optimal sitting ergonomics at work. Pharmacological management including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and muscle relaxants were prescribed to alleviate pain symptoms potentially associated with this condition until further evaluation.  Follow-up visits were scheduled for a re-evaluation after investigations had been completed. The patient was advised to report any progression of symptoms or development of new ones that could warrant immediate medical attention.  In conclusion, this case highlights a middle-aged divorced male presenting with progressively worsening weakness in his right lower extremity along with sensory disturbances in his right foot – raising clinical suspicion towards nerve entrapment syndrome such as sciatica. Prompt evaluation and appropriate management are vital for successful outcomes and improved quality of life for this patient population in order to prevent potential complications associated with such conditions.",create
"Miss R.T., a 28-year-old woman, G3P1111 and engaged, presented to our hospital seeking further evaluation for her unusual symptoms suggestive of a gynecological condition. Her medical history was unremarkable with no known chronic illnesses or previous surgeries. She had been receiving routine antenatal care (ANC) at a local clinic by a registered nurse.  During the initial consultation, Miss R.T. reported experiencing intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past two weeks. The pain was described as sharp and crampy in nature, with occasional radiation to her lower back. Additionally, she indicated that her menstrual cycle had become irregular lately and that she had missed her last period about six weeks ago.  Upon further inquiry about her prenatal care and any complications experienced during pregnancy, Miss R.T. disclosed that she had not received any ANC due to personal reasons until now. However, she acknowledged taking folic acid supplements regularly since learning about the positive pregnancy test result on home testing kits eight weeks ago.  A thorough physical examination was conducted to assess Miss R.T.'s overall health status. Her vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 115/70 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The focus shifted towards evaluating her abdomen where tenderness was detected upon palpation in the suprapubic region but no masses were felt.  Based on Miss R.T.'s gestational age estimations from her last menstrual period as well as clinical findings of abdominal tenderness without an obvious fetal heartbeat on auscultation using Doppler ultrasonography device, suspicion arose regarding a possible ectopic pregnancy or other gynecological pathology such as ovarian torsion or pelvic inflammatory disease.  To confirm the diagnosis and establish appropriate management plans accordingly, several laboratory investigations were initiated promptly alongside an urgent transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Blood samples were obtained for complete blood count (CBC), HCG levels, HIV and syphilis screening, as well as a coagulation profile.  The TVUS revealed the presence of a gestational sac with associated fetal pole and yolk sac located outside the uterine cavity. The adnexal structures appeared normal bilaterally, ruling out ovarian torsion or cysts. However, due to the unclear anatomical location of the pregnancy observed on TVUS and the concern for an ectopic pregnancy, further imaging studies such as an abdominal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were proposed.  Miss R.T. was counseled regarding the potential complications and risks associated with an ectopic pregnancy if confirmed. She consented to undergo additional investigations in order to determine appropriate management options that would prevent any imminent harm or complications arising from her condition.  In conclusion, Miss R.T., a previously healthy woman who had not received antenatal care until now presented with lower abdominal pain and missed periods consistent with a possible ectopic pregnancy based on preliminary assessments. Further investigations including HCG levels and additional imaging studies were planned to confirm this suspicion before establishing definitive management strategies tailored to her diagnosis while ensuring her safety throughout this process. Laboratory results revealed that Miss R.T.'s HCG levels were elevated, further supporting the suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. Her CBC showed no significant abnormalities, with a hemoglobin level of 12.4 grams per deciliter. Screening tests for HIV and syphilis were negative.  In light of these findings, an abdominal ultrasound was performed to ascertain the exact location and viability of the gestational sac. The ultrasound revealed an ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube, confirming the initial suspicion.  Multidisciplinary discussions involving obstetricians and gynecologists were held to determine the most appropriate course of action for Miss R.T.'s case. Given her stable condition and early diagnosis, she was considered a suitable candidate for medical management using methotrexate therapy.  Miss R.T. was provided detailed information about methotrexate, its potential side effects, expected follow-up visits, and signs indicating treatment failure or complications requiring immediate medical attention. She expressed her understanding and consented to proceed with this approach.  The medication cycle involved administering a single dose of methotrexate intramuscularly under close monitoring in our outpatient clinic setting. Comprehensive counseling regarding self-care at home after receiving methotrexate was provided as well.  Throughout her treatment course, Miss R.T.'s progress was regularly reassessed during scheduled follow-up visits every week initially and then spaced out depending on clinical response as dictated by established protocols. Serial HCG measurements were obtained to monitor resolution of hCG levels over time.  During one particular follow-up visit three weeks after initiating medical management with methotrexate therapy, Miss R.T.'s hCG levels demonstrated a downward trend indicative of successful treatment response without any evidence of worsening symptoms or complications complicating her clinical course.  Regular communication between Miss R.T., nurses specialized in reproductive healthcare counseling services within our hospital network proved instrumental in ensuring optimal adherence to self-care guidelines while also addressing any concerns or questions she had throughout her recovery phase.  After six weeks of vigilant monitoring and comprehensive follow-up, Miss R.T.'s hCG levels declined to undetectable levels. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the absence of residual ectopic tissue, and it was determined that her condition had resolved successfully without the need for surgical intervention.  Miss R.T. was advised to continue practicing contraception until she desired a future pregnancy, due to the increased risk of recurrent ectopic pregnancies associated with her medical history. She was referred back to her healthcare provider for ongoing primary care services including routine gynecological check-ups and preconception counseling as needed.  In conclusion, Miss R.T., a previously unattended pregnant patient with symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, underwent timely assessment and confirmation of diagnosis through imaging studies. Methotrexate treatment provided a successful outcome by managing the ectopic pregnancy non-surgically while preserving her fertility potential. Through close monitoring and collaborative care involving healthcare professionals specializing in reproductive health, Miss R.T.'s recovery progressed smoothly without complications warranting immediate interventions or prolonged hospitalization.",create
"Title: An Uncommon Scenario: A Tricky Diagnosis Unveiled  Introduction: The patient, Ms. Sarah Thompson, a 27-year-old primigravida, sought medical attention at her local health center due to persistent abdominal pain accompanied by intermittent episodes of vaginal bleeding. Her condition raised concerns among the attending healthcare professionals due to its unusual presentation and clinical course. This case report aims to shed light on Ms. Thompson's complex diagnostic journey, emphasizing key clinical findings and challenges faced during her management.  History of Presenting Illness: Ms. Thompson reported experiencing labor-like pains, akin to contractions, prompting her initial visit to the local health center. Since she was unable to recall the date of her last menstrual period accurately, an estimated gestational age was established based on ultrasound measurements performed during an antenatal appointment four weeks ago—one out of several that had been scheduled for her during this pregnancy period.  Past Medical History: No prior medical or surgical history was discerned from the patient's record or self-reporting data.  Screening Tests: Ms. Thompson's screening tests returned with negative results for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), demonstrating no evidence of viral infection.  Herbal Medication Use in Pregnancy: During interactions with healthcare providers and staff at the health center, Ms. Thompson disclosed a peculiar habit—she regularly consumed herbal remedies with claimed uterine-stimulating properties in an effort to initiate labor prematurely.  Delivery Complications and Post-partum Hemorrhage: Following natural vaginal delivery at term gestation, a healthy infant within normal weight range was born without complications; however, soon after giving birth in this manner characterized by minimal interventions performed by healthcare professionals onsite—the patient developed signs of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH). Concurrently, she complained of increasing abdominal pain but assuaged initial concerns were managed adequately within the realm of capabilities available at this primary care facility setting.  Diagnostic Difficulties: Ms. Thompson's ongoing symptoms, additional manifestations of intermittent heavy vaginal bleeding, and persistent abdominal pain left her healthcare providers perplexed. Their initial approach revolved around managing the apparent post-partum hemorrhage with conservative measures while pursuing investigations to identify the underlying etiology.  Referral to Secondary Care: Given the complexity of her condition and failing to improve significantly despite conventional management approaches, a decision was made to refer Ms. Thompson to a tertiary care hospital better equipped in handling complicated cases such as hers.  Specialist Consultations and Investigations: Upon admission to the hospital, Ms. Thompson was evaluated by a team of obstetricians and gynecologists who initiated further investigations as part of their diagnostic workup. Blood tests were repeated, including coagulation profile evaluation alongside comprehensive blood counts.  Imaging studies such as pelvic ultrasound were performed meticulously to assess for potential retained placental tissue or any other structural abnormalities that could account for her symptoms. Additionally, abdominal imaging was carried out to explore alternative explanations beyond obstetric complications contributing concurrently or independently.  The Elusive Diagnosis Revealed: After a comprehensive assessment involving inputs from various specialties including obstetrics, gynecology, hematology, and radiology—Ms. Thompson's puzzling clinical picture started falling into place like pieces converging towards resolution.  An ultrasound-guided endometrial biopsy was conducted after identifying potential endometrial pathology on previous testing modalities; it confirmed an unusual diagnosis that had eluded recognition so far—Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder (PASD).  Conclusion: This case highlights the intricacies often associated with diagnosing complex medical conditions that may present atypically initially be masked by associated processes such as post-partum hemorrhage in this instance coupled with intermittent heavy vaginal bleeding—a red herring diverting attention from underlying etiologies contributing cumulatively or separately within differing contexts necessitating investigative strategies encompassing varied subspecialties before unveiling the true diagnosis.",create
"Patient J. R. L is a twelve week old male infant who was admitted to the pediatric ward with a chief complaint of a persistent swelling on his right hand since birth and a six week history of intermittent fever. The swelling, initially the size of a small pea, has gradually enlarged over time, causing concern among his parents.  Upon further inquiry into the medical history, it was discovered that when Patient J. R. L was six weeks old, he was brought to a local clinic due to concerns regarding the swelling on his hand resembling an abscess or boil. The primary healthcare provider incised the swollen area in an attempt to drain any accumulated fluid or pus. A yellowish discharge was noted during the procedure but there was no significant improvement afterwards.  Instead, the swelling grew rapidly in size and became increasingly concerning for both Patient J.R.L's parents and healthcare providers alike. Poor wound healing at the site resulted in an open ulcer that eventually covered a large portion of his forearm.  During admission, physical examination revealed an uncomfortable infant with moderate erythema around the affected area on his right hand and forearm. A fluctuant mass measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter could be palpated beneath intact skin overlying this region.  The general examination displayed features indicating systemic involvement as well; Patient J.R.L appeared pale with poor weight gain compared to other infants of similar age and presented low-grade intermittent fever during hospitalization.  Further investigations were conducted to evaluate potential underlying causes for these symptoms: routine blood tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). These findings correlated with clinical suspicion towards potential infection at play within our patient's case presentation.  Radiological evaluation through ultrasound imaging revealed evidence indicative of deep-seated abscess formation involving multiple compartments within Patient J.R.L's right forearm musculature - likely secondary to chronic osteomyelitis related complications resulting from an initially mismanaged skin infection.  Upon discussion with our multidisciplinary team of pediatricians and surgeons, it was decided to proceed with surgical intervention. The goals of this intervention included thorough exploration and drainage of the abscess along with tissue culture collection for microbiological analysis.  Under general anesthesia, a curvilinear incision was made over the affected anatomical area, followed by dissection through subcutaneous tissue layers to reveal a deep-seated pus-filled cavity extending through multiple compartments within the forearm musculature. Copious amounts of purulent material were evacuated while ensuring meticulous debridement and local irrigation.  Samples were carefully collected in sterile containers for prompt laboratory analysis which ultimately revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, confirming a bacterial etiology contributing to Patient J.R.L's clinical presentation.  Post-operative care consisted primarily of appropriate surgical wound management including regular dressing changes combined with intravenous antibiotic therapy tailored against identified pathogens whilst closely monitoring systemic response through serial blood tests. Physical therapy referrals provided support for rehabilitation and promotion of optimal hand function post-healing.  Patient J.R.L demonstrated gradual improvement in his symptoms during hospital stay, including resolution in fever spikes alongside notable decrease in localized swelling and erythema. Close follow-up appointments have been scheduled for extended assessment as well as long-term care planning involving input from orthopedic specialists specializing in pediatric cases.  In summary, Patient J.R.L's case highlights the importance of early recognition and appropriate management when faced with atypical presentations involving swelling or infections among newborns. Timely intervention can help prevent complications such as prolonged illness, persistent deformity or functional impairment within these vulnerable patients where prompt diagnosis coupled with thorough interdisciplinary team work remains crucial towards ensuring positive clinical outcomes.",create
"Case Report 2  A 42-year-old male presented with sudden onset left-sided focal seizures which began earlier that day. Prior to seeking medical attention, he experienced two episodes lasting approximately 3-5 minutes each. These episodes were characterized by abnormal movements of his left arm and leg, accompanied by a marked disorientation afterwards. Upon arrival at the emergency department, he exhibited a tonic-clonic seizure involving his entire left side, including the face and upper and lower limbs.  The patient reported experiencing occasional headaches for several weeks prior to presentation; however, during the past five days, he had been enduring an intense throbbing headache localized to his right temple accompanied by severe light sensitivity and eye discomfort. Nonetheless, he vehemently denied any subjective complaints of fever or experiencing recent head trauma.  Upon physical examination upon arrival at the hospital, vital signs were within normal limits for his age. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities except for minimal weakness on his left side following the seizure activity that resolved quickly thereafter.  The patient's past medical history was remarkable for hypertension managed with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). He had not received any changes in medication regimen recently nor initiation of any new therapies.  Further diagnostic investigations were initiated promptly. Laboratory analysis demonstrated unremarkable complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels among others. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed no significant abnormalities including white blood cell count or glucose concentration.  Considering clinical features suggestive of focal seizures originating from the right hemisphere accompanied by recent-onset headaches associated with photophobia and painful eyes without any obvious precipitating event or evidence of infection/inflammatory process on initial evaluation prompted further investigations regarding an underlying etiology.   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan was subsequently performed which displayed a small chronic ischemic lesion within the right cerebral hemisphere, consistent with a previous embolic event.  Based on the clinical presentation and radiological findings, a likely diagnosis of embolic stroke was made. The patient was started on appropriate secondary prevention measures including antiplatelet therapy in coordination with stroke specialists. Furthermore, counsel regarding lifestyle modifications to control hypertension and reduce cardiovascular risk factors was provided.  During his hospital stay, the patient's neurologic status remained stable without further seizure activity. He was discharged home with scheduled follow-up appointments for neurology consultation to assess seizure control and to develop an individualized plan for long-term seizure management.  In conclusion, this case highlights an unusual presentation of embolic stroke characterized by new-onset focal seizures accompanied by recent-onset headache associated with photophobia and painful eyes. Early recognition of atypical symptoms such as these is crucial for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of patients presenting with similar clinical features Case Report 3  A 28-year-old female presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset left-sided focal seizures. She reported experiencing two episodes earlier that day, each lasting approximately 2-3 minutes, characterized by abnormal movements of her left arm and leg. These episodes were followed by a period of confusion and disorientation. On arrival at the hospital, she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure involving her left side, including the face and upper and lower limbs.  The patient complained of persistent global headaches for the past five days. The headache was described as dull in nature, accompanied by sensitivity to light (photophobia) and eye discomfort. She denied any history of fever, nausea, vomiting or recent head trauma.  Upon examination upon admission, vital signs were stable within normal limits for her age. Neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities except for a mild weakness on her left side following the seizure activity.  The patient's medical history was unremarkable with no chronic medical conditions or use of medications.  Initial laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were all within normal range. Lumbar puncture was performed with cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing no notable abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count or glucose concentration.  Given the presence of new-onset focal seizures originating from the left hemisphere combined with recent-onset headaches associated with photophobia and painful eyes without any identifiable precipitating factors or evidence of infection/inflammation on initial evaluation prompted further investigations to establish an underlying cause.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed a well-defined mass lesion within the left temporal lobe consistent with a low-grade glioma. Further consultation was sought from neurosurgeons who recommended surgical resection as definitive treatment for this tumor type.  While waiting for surgery scheduling, antiepileptic medications were initiated to control seizure activity. The patient also received counseling on the upcoming surgical procedure and possible long-term effects of the tumor.  In conclusion, this case represents an atypical presentation of a low-grade glioma in a young patient characterized by new-onset focal seizures, along with associated headaches, photophobia and painful eyes. Early recognition and further investigation are crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention to ensure optimal clinical outcomes for patients presenting with similar clinical features. Neurosurgical intervention combined with appropriate antiepileptic management is vital in providing effective treatment for such cases.  The patient was discharged from the hospital with close follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor seizure control, plan for surgery, provide necessary education about the disease process and postoperative care, as well as offer psychological support during this challenging time.",create
"Title: A 52-year-old man with HIV/AIDS and Progressive Respiratory Symptoms  Abstract: We present the case of a 52-year-old man with a history of HIV/AIDS for 9 years who presented with progressive respiratory symptoms, despite being on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The patient experienced breathlessness on exertion and fatigue over a period of two years, although he denied any cough, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea. His medical history was significant for well-controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the patient had been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli five years ago and had been receiving warfarin ever since. This report underscores the importance of considering both common and rare etiologies in patients living with HIV/AIDS.  Case Presentation:  A 52-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of increasing breathlessness on exertion and persistent fatigue over the past two years. He denied any associated cough, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea. The patient mentioned having a chronic medical condition known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), which had been diagnosed nine years earlier.  The patient's past medical history included well-managed hypertension managed on enalapril (10 mg once daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg once daily). Additionally, he had dyslipidemia controlled by atorvastatin (40 mg once daily).  Of note, a detailed review revealed that five years ago during an unrelated hospitalization for pneumonia at another facility; he was incidentally found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli. Treatment was initiated based on anticoagulation principles using warfarin therapy at an appropriate International Normalized Ratio target range between 2-3.  Besides his comorbidities requiring chronic pharmacotherapy described above; he had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since the time of his HIV diagnosis. His HAART regimen consisted of a fixed-dose combination tablet of emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily in combination with the non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.  Physical examination revealed a well-nourished man in no acute distress. Vital signs demonstrated a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at ambient air measured by pulse oximetry was within the normal limit at 98%.  Spirometry results were suggestive of moderate restrictive impairment, displaying an FEV1/FVC ratio at approximately 67% (predicted). There were no significant abnormalities detected on auscultation over both lung fields. Cardiac examination was unremarkable without audible murmurs or extra heart sounds.  Given the patient's recent history of bilateral pulmonary emboli and his persistent respiratory symptoms despite being on ART, further investigations were warranted to determine potential etiologies which could contribute to his symptoms.  His laboratory results were notable for stable CD4 counts above 500 cells/mm³ over follow-up appointments throughout previous years. HIV viral loads had been consistently undetectable except for one spike reported as ""low-level viremia"" nine months ago.  Conclusion:  We present a case emphasizing the importance of considering various causes when evaluating patients presenting with progressive respiratory symptoms while living with HIV/AIDS. This patient's clinical history includes prior pulmonary emboli and ongoing warfarin therapy related to it; yet, additional investigations are necessary to delineate other potential contributors to his chronic dyspnea and fatigue despite adequate control measures for underlying conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia.",create
"Mr. John Smith, a 58-year-old male patient, arrives at the outpatient department of Cardiology with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. He works as a truck driver and has been experiencing these symptoms for the past six months.   According to Mr. Smith's medical history, he was completely asymptomatic prior to the onset of his symptoms. Initially, he noticed occasional episodes of chest pain that gradually became more frequent and intense over time. The pain is described as dull and localized in nature, predominantly located on the left side of his chest.  There are no specific aggravating or relieving factors identified by Mr. Smith; however, physical activities like walking uphill or carrying heavy objects seem to exacerbate his symptoms further. He recalls feeling a sense of tightness in his chest during these activities.  In addition to the chest pain, Mr. Smith also reports experiencing shortness of breath for the past two months. He notices it mostly when climbing stairs or engaging in any form of exertion that requires increased oxygen demand.  Upon further inquiry about associated symptoms, Mr. Smith reveals experiencing occasional lightheadedness when he stands up quickly from a sitting or supine position but not associated with any loss of consciousness.  Regarding past medical history, Mr. Smith mentions having been diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago which has been managed fairly well with medication (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor). No other major health issues have been documented so far.  Further examination reveals no facial asymmetry or abnormalities; however, an additional symptom manifests itself during this discussion: occasional episodes numbness on the left side from head down following nerve path towards jawline lasting few minutes usually after prolonged exposure change cold/warm environment ""wind feeling"".  In conclusion: Mr. John Smith is a 58-year-old male truck driver presenting at Cardiology outpatient department with complaints suggestive angina pectoris characterized by progressively worsening chest pain and associated shortness of breath. His clinical findings indicate a possible stable angina with stable asymtomatic hypertension. He also mentions episodes of lightheadedness on sudden positional changes and numbnes on the left side of his head.  Further investigations, including an ECG and stress test, will be required to confirm the diagnosis as well as evaluate the severity and extent of coronary artery disease. Additionally, appropriate management strategies such as lifestyle modifications, medication adjustment or addition for hypertension control, and possible anti-anginal medications will be discussed with Mr. Smith during subsequent visits to manage his symptomatology effectively. Further evaluation of Mr. John Smith's medical history and physical examination reveals additional symptoms that require attention. Upon further inquiry, Mr. Smith reports occasional palpitations accompanied by a sense of ""racing heart"" lasting for a few minutes and subsiding on its own. These episodes occur once or twice a week but are unrelated to any specific triggers or activities.  Mr. Smith also mentions intermittent episodes of mild dizziness, characterized by a sensation of lightheadedness and feeling off-balance particularly when he turns his head quickly or changes positions abruptly.  His past medical history includes an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg three years ago, for which he was treated with anticoagulant therapy for six months. No ongoing clotting disorders are reported.  Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities apart from mild obesity and elevated blood pressure readings ranging between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg across multiple visits.  Given the presence of these additional symptoms and Mr. Smith's medical history, the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias is raised as a potential contributing factor to his presenting complaints.  Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the suspected arrhythmias in conjunction with his existing coronary artery disease diagnosis:  1. Complete blood count (CBC): To assess for any underlying anemia or infection. 2. Electrocardiogram (ECG): To identify any abnormal cardiac electrical activity. 3. Holter monitor: A portable device worn by the patient over 24-48 hours that records continuous ECG data to capture any arrhythmic events during daily activities. 4. Echocardiography: An ultrasound scan used to assess cardiac function, identify structural abnormalities, and estimate ejection fraction. 5.Cardiac stress test: To evaluate exercise tolerance levels, detect ischemia during physical exertion if present 6.Doppler ultrasound study for deep venous system lower limbs 7. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): To evaluate blood pressure patterns over a 24-hour period, including during sleep and waking hours.  Based on the findings from these investigations, appropriate treatment strategies will be implemented. This can range from lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight reduction, and dietary changes to pharmacological interventions like antiarrhythmic drugs or anticoagulation therapy if indicated.  Further follow-up visits will be scheduled to assess treatment efficacy, monitor cardiac function, and address any concerns or new symptoms that may arise during Mr. Smith's course of management.  In conclusion: Mr. John Smith's clinical manifestations suggest a possible underlying arrhythmia in addition to his stable angina. Further diagnostic testing has been recommended to confirm this suspicion and identify the specific type of arrhythmia involved. Subsequent treatment interventions will aim at managing both conditions concurrently while optimizing his blood pressure control as well as assessing for any recurrence or complications related to DVT history with the aid of Doppler ultrasound study for deep venous system lower limbs.  Continued monitoring followed by ongoing patient education regarding symptom recognition is necessary to ensure comprehensive care delivery and maximize Mr. Smith's overall cardiovascular health outcomes in line with evidence-based guidelines.",create
"Patient 35 year old Caucasian male father of one presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain and swelling in the scrotum. The patient reported a dull, aching pain in his lower abdomen and groin region, accompanied by bilateral scrotal swelling and a sensation of heaviness. The left-sided scrotal swelling had been present for approximately four years, while the right-sided swelling had developed over the past two years.   The patient denied any relevant past medical history or any significant personal or family history that could be pertinent to establish a provisional diagnosis. He further mentioned that he had not experienced any recent trauma or injury to his genital area.  Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were stable with no abnormalities observed in cardiovascular function, respiratory status, nor neurological examination findings.  During local examination of the genital area, there was noticeable bilateral swelling involving both hemiscrota; however, it appeared more prominent on the left side compared to the right side. Further evaluation revealed no discoloration or skin changes associated with either testicle or surrounding structures. The skin was intact without any palpable nodules or irregularities.   In order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and establish appropriate management strategies for this patient, additional investigations were ordered. Blood workup included routine laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC), liver enzyme levels (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs), and tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). All routine blood test results fell within normal ranges.  To visualize potential structural anomalies within the abdominal and pelvic regions that may contribute to the presenting symptoms and findings on physical examination, imaging studies such as ultrasound scans were performed. Ultrasound revealed bilateral enlargement of both testicles; however, there were no evident masses detected during this initial investigation.  Due to persistent symptoms along with concerning physical exam findings warranting further evaluation, a consultation with a urologist was requested for the patient. The urologist planned to pursue additional investigations to reach a final diagnosis. These would include a scrotal ultrasound, which provides more detailed visualization of the testicles and surrounding structures.  The provisionally suspected diagnosis included various etiologies ranging from testicular malignancy such as seminoma or non-seminoma germ cell tumors, hydrocele and varicoceles, among others. However, at this stage of evaluation, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.  In conclusion, this case describes a 35-year-old male presenting with chronic abdominal pain accompanied by bilateral scrotal swelling and heaviness. With no significant past medical history or family background that could shed light on potential diagnoses, further investigations were initiated including blood tests and ultrasound scans. The suspected differential diagnoses involve conditions such as malignancies (particularly testicular tumors), hydroceles and varicoceles. Collaboration with a urology specialist was warranted to guide subsequent investigation and management plans for this patient's condition. Further studies are required to establish an accurate diagnosis in order to implement appropriate treatment strategies tailored to this individual's needs. Following the initial evaluation and consultation with the urologist, additional investigations were carried out as part of the diagnostic workup for our patient.  A scrotal ultrasound was performed to provide a more detailed visualization of the testicles and surrounding structures. The ultrasound revealed bilateral enlargement of both testicles, confirming the previous findings. However, no masses or abnormalities were detected within the testicular parenchyma or epididymis.  Given these inconclusive results, it became crucial to explore further in order to definitively diagnose and manage our patient's condition.  To determine if there were any underlying hormonal imbalances that could be contributing to his symptoms, hormone panel testing was conducted. The results showed normal levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin. No hormonal abnormalities were identified that might explain his clinical presentation.  Since all non-invasive investigations failed to provide a conclusive diagnosis thus far, a decision was made to proceed with an exploratory surgical procedure known as a diagnostic laparoscopy. This minimally invasive technique would allow for direct visualization and assessment of intra-abdominal structures along with biopsy sampling if any suspicious lesions were encountered.  During the laparoscopic procedure, multiple small incisions were made in the abdominal wall through which specialized instruments including a camera were inserted. The surgeon meticulously examined various intraperitoneal organs including the liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, and lymph nodes for any signs of pathology or abnormality.  Ultimately, two small nodules measuring approximately 0.5 cm in diameter each were discovered on one of the peritoneal surfaces just below where it attaches to the left inguinal canal—a site unaccounted for during prior evaluations due to its deep location within the abdomen. A biopsy was promptly performed on these nodules during surgery and sent for histopathological examination.  The post-operative recovery period was uneventful, with the patient being closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications. Once he had sufficiently healed, follow-up consultation was scheduled to discuss the biopsy results and establish a definitive diagnosis.  Histopathological analysis revealed that the nodules were consistent with metastatic seminoma—a type of testicular germ cell tumor that typically arises from malignant transformation within the testicles and subsequently spreads to distant sites through lymphatic or hematogenous routes.  Upon receiving this significant finding, an urgent multidisciplinary meeting comprising urologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists was held to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to our patient. The proposed management included surgical removal of both testicles (bilateral orchiectomy) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy targeting any potential occult micrometastases.  The devastating diagnosis left our patient understandably bewildered and apprehensive about the challenging journey ahead. Patient education sessions focusing on his specific condition were organized to address his concerns, explain treatment strategies in detail, outline possible side effects of therapy while reassuring him that prognosis for early-stage seminomas is generally favorable.  In conclusion, this case describes a 35-year-old male who initially presented with chronic abdominal pain along with bilateral scrotal swelling and heaviness. Despite multiple investigations indicating no abnormalities earlier on in his evaluation process—including normal ultrasound findings—a diagnostic laparoscopy eventually led to discovery of metastatic seminoma nodules within the peritoneal cavity. This rare presentation highlights the importance of persistence in clinical practice when faced with inconclusive results. Appropriate interdisciplinary collaboration allowed for prompt establishment of further diagnostic steps leading towards an eventual definitive diagnosis and subsequent development of a comprehensive management plan tailored specifically for our patient's unique circumstances.",create
"Case 2: A 60-year-old female patient presented to our department with a two-week history of worsening headaches and intermittent right-sided weakness. The patient reported no significant head trauma but had noticed increasing difficulty with daily activities such as writing and buttoning clothes. Upon further questioning, the patient disclosed a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which were well-controlled.  Physical examination revealed decreased strength in her right upper and lower extremities, with notable difficulty in gripping objects. Cranial CT scan was performed, revealing bilateral chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH), more prominent on the left side. The findings were consistent with the patient's symptoms.  In addition to her chronic medical conditions, the patient had also been experiencing occasional palpitations and shortness of breath during physical exertion in recent months. To assess her cardiovascular health prior to surgery, chest radiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. The chest radiograph showed mild cardiomegaly but no other abnormalities. The ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  Laboratory investigations included a comprehensive blood analysis to assess hematological parameters. Fortunately, all results fell within normal limits, ruling out any coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia that could complicate surgical management.  Given the symptomatology observed on examination along with supportive imaging findings showing bilateral CSDHs predominantly on the left side, neurosurgical intervention was necessary to evacuate these hematomas.  The patient was informed about the potential risks associated with surgery including bleeding or infection but decided to proceed due to persistent debilitating symptoms affecting her quality of life.  An interdisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists reviewed the case thoroughly before proceeding with surgery. A detailed discussion ensued regarding management strategies for perioperative hypertension control given that uncontrolled hypertension could increase bleeding risk during surgical manipulation within the cranium. It was decided to optimize the patient's blood pressure preoperatively and monitor it closely throughout the procedure.  On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine in a slightly elevated position. General anesthesia was induced followed by endotracheal intubation for airway protection during surgery. Intraoperative monitoring included arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and oxygen saturation.  A left frontal burr hole craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematomas under neuro-navigation guidance was performed successfully without any intraoperative complications. The surgical team ensured meticulous hemostasis before closing the incision site with absorbable sutures.  Postoperatively, neurological status monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) revealed gradual improvement of motor function in her right upper and lower extremities within 24 hours. Analgesic medications were provided as necessary to manage anticipated pain at both operative sites - her head and chest wall from incision discomfort caused by coughing post-intubation.  The patient remained stable throughout her hospital stay with continued improvement in muscle strength on daily examinations performed by nursing staff as part of postoperative care. Physical therapy interventions were initiated early to aid in functional recovery.  In conclusion, this case highlights the successful management of a 60-year-old female patient presenting with chronic subdural hematomas causing persistent headaches and limb weakness. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and individualized perioperative care planning tailored to her coexisting medical conditions, neurosurgical intervention led to significant improvement in symptoms and subsequent rehabilitation efforts aimed at optimizing her overall functional outcomes.",create
"Case: A 60-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was referred to the oral medicine and oral surgery department at HILLTOP Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) due to persistent pain and discomfort localized in the left mandibular region. The patient reported experiencing difficulty in opening his mouth fully and constant tenderness while chewing.  Upon conducting an extraoral examination, it was noted that the patient had a slightly swollen left submandibular lymph node measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. The lymph node exhibited firm consistency upon palpation.  During the intraoral examination, it was observed that the patient had poor oral hygiene with plaque accumulation on multiple teeth. In particular, attention was drawn to a gingival bleeding lesion with raised edges situated adjacent to the first molar (36). The lesion appeared ulcerated locally and had a class 2 mobility grade.  The medical history of this patient revealed he had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus twenty years ago. He has been managing this condition with insulin injections as prescribed by his endocrinologist. Additionally, he has a long-standing history of hypertension for which he takes antihypertensive medications regularly. Osteoarthritis affects multiple joints throughout his body, causing chronic pain for which he takes over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs occasionally.  The most notable cardiovascular event in this patient's medical history is being treated for coronary artery disease via CABG surgery eight years ago at a different hospital facility after suffering from recurring angina symptoms despite optimal medical management. Since then, regular follow-up visits indicated satisfactory recovery post-surgery without any significant cardiac complications or additional interventions required.  Given his current presentation at HILLTOP Hospital's oral medicine department, further diagnostic tests were arranged for our patient including radiographic imaging such as panoramic radiograph and CBCT scan. Blood investigations were also ordered to assess his glycemic control and inflammatory markers.  The clinical findings, presence of swollen submandibular lymph nodes, along with the local ulcerated gingival lesion raised concerns for possible underlying pathology within the affected mandibular region. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a malignant neoplasm that commonly involves the lymph nodes and occasionally manifests in oral tissues causing non-healing ulcers, was considered as a differential diagnosis based on these findings.  To manage the patient's symptoms effectively while awaiting diagnostic confirmation, conservative measures were implemented. He was advised to maintain rigorous oral hygiene practices at home including comprehensive brushing twice daily along with flossing. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was prescribed to reduce plaque accumulation until further treatment options could be considered.  The patient progressed well with symptomatic relief during his follow-up visits at regular intervals scheduled every two weeks. In subsequent appointments, results from blood investigations showed relatively stable glycemic control without any significant abnormalities in other inflammatory markers.  Based on evolving clinical evidence combined with laboratory results received over a 6-week period from the initial presentation, appropriate multidisciplinary consultations were conducted between oral medicine specialists and an oncologist team specialized in hematological malignancies to reach a definitive diagnosis and explore management options tailored specifically for our patient's needs.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of identifying systemic conditions as contributing factors for intraoral manifestations. The complex medical history of our patient necessitates close collaboration between various healthcare disciplines while formulating an accurate diagnosis and establishing optimal treatment plans to improve overall outcomes for patients experiencing similar symptoms.",create
"Case: A 42-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 4, presented with an increased size of breast lump. Her history revealed a diagnosis of left breast fibroadenoma measuring 2cm in diameter, made by her primary care physician five years ago. She had regular mammograms every two years at a community clinic and the fibroadenoma size remained stable during this period. However, she was referred to our institution in May 2021 due to the recent increase in the size of the breast lump noticed on self-examination.  The patient stated that she first noticed a small lump in her left breast about five years ago while performing her monthly self-breast examination. At that time, she sought medical attention from her primary care physician who ordered imaging studies to further evaluate the lump. The mammogram confirmed the presence of a solitary well-circumscribed mass consistent with fibroadenoma measuring approximately 2cm in diameter.  Due to its benign nature and stability over time, close surveillance was deemed appropriate for this patient considering her age and risk factors. Therefore, it was decided at that time to continue monitoring regularly without any intervention required or referral to a specialist.  Over the last five years since diagnosis, the patient underwent regular mammograms every two years as recommended by national guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in average-risk women. All follow-up mammograms showed no concerning changes regarding growth or appearance of the fibroadenoma.  However, earlier this month during routine self-breast examination which she performed on a monthly basis as advised by healthcare professionals; she observed an increase in size and firmness of the previously stable mass located within her left breast.  Concerned about these new findings, she followed up with another appointment with her primary care physician who promptly ordered repeat imaging studies including diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound evaluation. The results indicated significant enlargement of pre-existing fibroadenoma now measuring approximately 5cm in its maximum dimension.  In light of this concerning change, her primary care physician decided to refer the patient to our institution for further evaluation and management. The patient arrived at our clinic expressing worries regarding the recent growth of the breast lump, as well as new onset pain and discomfort associated with it.  Upon physical examination, a solitary, non-tender mass was palpated in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. No axillary lymphadenopathy or skin changes were noted.  Given the significant increase in size along with new associated symptoms such as pain and discomfort, additional investigations were indicated. It was planned to perform a core needle biopsy of the fibroadenoma under imaging guidance to verify its histopathological characteristics and rule out any potential malignant transformation.  Furthermore, bloodwork including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), serum tumor markers such as cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and CA 27-29 levels were ordered to assess for any other concerning findings or underlying systemic pathologies that might contribute towards these changes.  To provide comprehensive care for this patient who is understandably anxious about recent developments, we aim to communicate effectively while addressing her concerns by explaining the rationale behind various investigations planned and ensuring a thorough evaluation of all possible differential diagnoses before confirming a treatment plan tailored specifically according to her needs.",create
"Title: A 38-year-old Woman with Chronic Cough and Pleural Effusion  Introduction: Ms. K is a 38-year-old woman who presented to the clinic with a chronic cough and pleural effusion. She has a significant medical history of bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory infections. Furthermore, she has been an active smoker for the past 20 years.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. K complained of a persistent, non-productive cough that had been present for three months. She also reported experiencing occasional night sweats, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms over the same period. Additionally, she noted occasional mild dyspnea on exertion.  Medical History: Ms. K had been diagnosed with bronchiectasis ten years ago after presenting with recurrent chest infections characterized by productive cough, purulent sputum, and hemoptysis. Her condition was managed conservatively through chest physiotherapy and appropriate antibiotic therapy during exacerbations. She was otherwise fit and had no other significant medical history or allergies to medications.  Clinical Findings:  Physical Examination: On examination, Ms. K appeared generally pale but not in any acute distress at rest. Vital signs were stable within normal limits: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min (without apparent distress), temperature98°F(36°C). Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung zone. No rales or rhonchi were audible in any lung fields bilaterally. There were no palpable lymph nodes on neck examination or hepatosplenomegaly noticed upon abdominal palpation. No clubbing of fingers or peripheral edema was appreciated.  Investigations:  Laboratory Findings: Complete blood count showed mild anemia (hemoglobin level of10 g/dL)  Radiographic Imaging:  A posterior-anterior chest radiograph revealed a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, confirmed by lateral decubitus chest X-ray. The right hemidiaphragm was obscured due to the effusion, and mediastinal shift was appreciated.  Diagnostic Procedures: To further evaluate the pleural effusion and rule out malignancy, a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed. Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed an exudative nature with elevated adenosine deaminase levels (greater than 40 U/L) and lymphocytic predominance.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea on exertion, unilateral pleural effusion with lymphocytic predominance and elevated adenosine deaminase levels in the pleural fluid analysis, a high index of suspicion for tuberculous pleurisy was considered.  Treatment Plan:  Considering the clinical findings suggestive of tuberculosis (TB), Ms. K was started on standard antituberculous therapy consisting of Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), and Ethambutol (E) for an initial period of two months. Continuation phase treatment with HR regimen would then be continued for another four months. She was provided education regarding adherence to therapy as well as counseling on smoking cessation strategies.  Follow-up Plan: Ms. K is scheduled for regular follow-up visits every month to monitor her tuberculosis treatment response. During these visits, her symptoms will be assessed along with periodic laboratory investigations such as sputum testing or chest imaging studies if needed. Her progress in smoking cessation efforts will also be discussed during each visit.  Conclusion: This case highlights a middle-aged woman presenting with chronic cough and weight loss coupled with lung pathology suggestive of tuberculous pleurisy following years of bronchiectasis management. The prompt diagnosis initiation of appropriate antituberculous treatment, along with tailored follow-up plans, will be vital in ensuring Ms. K's successful recovery and improving her long-term respiratory health.",create
"Title: A 52-year-old male presenting with persistent knee pain and limited mobility: A case study  Introduction: A 52-year-old male patient, Mr. John Smith, presented to the Orthopedic Department of Oakwood General Hospital (Springfield, USA). He complained of persistent pain and difficulty in flexing his right knee joint. No significant medical issues were previously reported for the patient. This clinical case aims to explore further into the origin of the symptoms and provide a comprehensive evaluation.  Clinical History: Mr. Smith reported prolonged discomfort and instability in his right knee joint for approximately eight months. The symptoms progressively worsened over time, leading him to seek medical assistance at our hospital. During assessment interviews, Mr. Smith denied any direct trauma or involvement in strenuous physical activities that could have attributed to his condition.  Past Medical History: No pertinent details regarding past surgeries or injuries were obtained during Mr. Smith's assessment process.  Examination Findings: Physical examination revealed localized tenderness on palpation over the medial aspect of his right knee joint and slight effusion without redness or warmth upon inspection. Passive range-of-motion was determined as limited flexion of approximately 90 degrees due to intense pain experienced by Mr. Smith when attempting deep flexion.  Radiological Evaluation: To evaluate the underlying cause accurately, radiographic imaging was performed on Mr. Smith's right knee joint as part of routine diagnostic procedures deemed necessary by our orthopedic team.  Radiographic findings revealed mild osteoarthritic changes characterized by narrowing of the medial compartment space with marginal osteophyte formation seen along tibiofemoral articulation surfaces consistent with degenerative arthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II). No signs of bony erosions or fractures were observed within the imaging examination limits.  Risk Factors Assessment:  During thorough patient history analysis, no significant risk factors related to chronic joints diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout, or previous traumatic injuries were identified. Mr. Smith denied any smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.  Treatment Plan: Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and radiographic evidence suggesting degenerative knee arthritis (localized to the medial compartment), a comprehensive treatment plan was devised for Mr. Smith.  1. Medications: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation in the affected joint. 2. Physical Therapy: Mr. Smith was recommended to undergo targeted physical therapy sessions focusing on therapeutic exercises, proprioception training, and gait training. 3. Lifestyle Modifications: The patient was advised to maintain a healthy body weight by incorporating regular exercise into his routine, avoiding strenuous activities that exacerbate knee pain. 4. Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injection: In cases where conservative measures fail to provide adequate relief from symptoms, consideration would be given for an intra-articular corticosteroid injection.  Follow-up Strategy: Mr. Smith's progress will be monitored through follow-up appointments at regular intervals of six weeks initially and then as per clinical necessity thereafter for further evaluation of his condition and adjustment of treatment strategies if needed.  Conclusion: This case study highlights the diagnostic assessment process of a 52-year-old male presenting with persistent knee pain and limited mobility attributed to osteoarthritis affecting the medial compartment of his right knee joint. An individualized treatment plan involving conservative management techniques has been initiated with close monitoring required for assessing response to therapy along with potential adjustments as required by patient needs during follow-up visits in our Orthopedic Department at Oakwood General Hospital in Springfield, USA",create
"Clinical Case: A 33-year-old woman presented to the dental clinic complaining of dissatisfaction with her smile due to excessive gingival display. There were no notable medical or family history, and the patient reported no contraindications for any proposed treatment. On clinical evaluation, an extraoral examination revealed symmetric facial features with normal lip competence. Intraorally, a sufficient amount of attached gingiva was observed, supporting a diagnosis of ""gummy smile."" However, upon smiling, the patient displayed visible teeth from the maxillary right first molar to maxillary left first premolar with 6-7 mm of gingival exposure. The maxillary anterior teeth exhibited normal anatomic proportions.  Patient History: Ms. S is a non-smoking 33-year-old female who presented seeking improvement in the aesthetics of her smile. Her medical history is unremarkable and she does not take any medications or have any known allergies. She maintains good oral hygiene practices, including regular brushing twice daily and flossing once daily.  Clinical Examination: Extraoral examination demonstrated facial symmetry at rest without any evidence of lip incompetency or abnormal muscle movements affecting her dento-facial esthetics.  Intraoral examination revealed excellent oral health status with minimal plaque accumulation and healthy periodontal tissues throughout all areas examined. The attached gingiva was within normal limits on both buccal and lingual aspects in relation to all teeth surveyed in both arches.  Upon requesting Ms.S to perform a full smile for evaluation purposes, it was observed that there was significant visualization of gum tissue involving from the right first molar up until the left first premolar position in her upper jaw.  The dimensional evaluation indicated approximately 6-7 mm vertical space from the tip of incisal edges up until where gums emerged indicating an excess gingival display while smiling conditionally categorized under ""gummy smile.""  Differential Diagnosis: 1) Excessive Gingival Display (Gummy Smile) 2) Vertical Maxillary Excess 3) Hyperactive Upper Lip  Treatment Plan: The treatment plan for Ms. S involves coordinating interdisciplinary care with the aesthetic dental team consisting of a periodontist, orthodontist, and oral surgeon. The following procedures were discussed with the patient:  1) Periodontal Crown Lengthening: To address the excessive gingival display, surgical crown lengthening will be performed to reveal more tooth structure. This procedure aims to recontour the gum line, reducing vertical dimensions and harmonizing it with her smile.  2) Orthodontic Treatment: Following periodontal crown lengthening, orthodontic treatment will be initiated to optimize tooth position and alignment within the arches.  3) Oral Surgery Consultation: An oral surgery consultation will be arranged at a later stage if deemed necessary after completion of crown lengthening and orthodontic interventions. This phase would involve further evaluation for possible skeletal discrepancies or lip-related issues such as hyperactivity or muscle tension that might contribute to an unfavorable esthetic outcome.  4) Comprehensive Maintenance Care: Postoperative care instructions emphasizing thorough plaque control techniques, regular dental visits every six months for monitoring healing progress, maintaining periodontal health along with any additional restorative requirements may be incorporated into Ms.S's overall comprehensive maintenance plan.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Ms. S presents as a 33-year-old female seeking improvement in her smile aesthetics due to excessive gingival display during smiling. Based on clinical examination findings and diagnostic evaluation methods conducted by our interdisciplinary team consisting of a periodontist, orthodontist, and oral surgeon specialists; a comprehensive treatment plan involving surgical crown lengthening followed by orthodontic intervention seems most appropriate in addressing her concerns while optimizing functional stability for long-term success.

"A 45-year-old female with a history of diabetes presented with sudden-onset, severe right lower abdominal pain, radiating to the back and associated with vomiting and fever. She denied any history of urinary symptoms or recent upper respiratory tract infections. The patient denied any contact with individuals who had tested positive for COVID-19. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable and in moderate distress but was fully alert and oriented. Her vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.  Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant along with involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness localized to McBurney's point. Bowel sounds were audible but slightly diminished compared to normal. Rectal examination was normal without any palpable masses or melena.  Laboratory investigations showed an elevated white blood cell count of 17,000 cells/mm³ (reference range: 4,000-11,000 cells/mm³) with a predominance of neutrophils on differential count. Hemoglobin levels were within normal limits at 13 g/dL (reference range:12-15 g/dL). Serum electrolytes were within normal ranges.  Based on the clinical presentation and physical findings consistent with acute appendicitis, the patient underwent urgent surgical consultation for further management. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan were considered but delayed due to limited availability during off-hours at the hospital.  Given her ongoing symptoms and clinical deterioration over time along with evidence of systemic inflammation indicated by fever and elevated white blood cell count - as well as classic signs on physical examination - an immediate exploratory laparotomy was performed by the surgical team without preoperative imaging.  Intraoperatively it was noted that there were fecaliths obstructing the lumen of the appendix leading to inflammation and subsequent perforation of the appendix. An appendectomy was completed, and intra-abdominal lavage with normal saline was performed followed by thorough irrigation with antibiotics.  Postoperatively, the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics consisting of a combination of ceftriaxone and metronidazole for coverage against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. Pain management was achieved using intravenous opioids as needed, along with antiemetics for symptomatic relief. The patient was kept nil per oral initially to facilitate recovery from intestinal manipulation but gradually advanced to a clear liquid diet as tolerated.  During her hospital stay, she demonstrated sustained clinical improvement with resolution of fever, reduction in abdominal pain, and return of normal bowel function. The surgical wound remained clean without any signs of infection or dehiscence.  The patient's blood cultures obtained on admission remained negative after 48 hours. Repeat laboratory investigations showed a reducing trend in her total white cell count that had normalized within three days post-operatively.  Given the uncomplicated postoperative course and return to baseline condition without complications observed during hospitalization, she was discharged home on postoperative day four with oral antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) for one week along with clear instructions for follow-up at the surgical clinic in two weeks' time to ensure appropriate wound healing monitoring.  In summary, based on clinical presentation consistent with acute appendicitis including right lower quadrant pain associated with fever and leukocytosis - this patient underwent an emergency surgical intervention resulting in successful appendectomy without any immediate complications observed during hospitalization or subsequent follow-up visits at our tertiary care facility.",create
"Ms. Y, a 65-year-old retired teacher, presented to the clinic with complaints of exertional dyspnea and a chronic ulcerated wound on her right foot that had been persistently bleeding on contact for the past four months. Ms. Y reported that her symptoms began gradually about four months ago and were initially characterized by pain and swelling in her right foot. The swelling and tenderness progressed over time, accompanied by skin peeling and the development of a budding wound.  Ms. Y sought medical attention at a local clinic in her hometown, located in the rural outskirts of Gwalior (Central India), where she was initiated on antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin at a daily dose of 2 grams for two months. Unfortunately, this treatment regimen did not bring any improvement to her condition.  During the initial evaluation at our clinic, Ms. Y reported mild shortness of breath upon performing daily activities such as walking up stairs or carrying groceries, indicating exertional dyspnea. She mentioned experiencing fatigue after minimal activity as well.  On further examination of Ms. Y's right foot, we observed an ulcerated wound measuring approximately 4 cm x 4 cm situated on the plantar aspect near the base of her toes. The wound appeared deep with irregular edges and exhibited signs of active bleeding upon touch.  In addition to her respiratory symptoms and the chronic ulceration on her foot, Ms.Y also revealed being diabetic for over ten years but having experienced controlled blood glucose levels through regular medication intake prescribed by primary care physicians from neighboring clinics.  Considering both Ms.Y's diabetic history as well as persistent ulceration despite prior antibiotic treatment, we suspected that she might be suffering from a diabetic foot infection with potentially deeper tissue involvement beyond what was visible externally.  To validate this hypothesis further, an arterial Doppler study was ordered to evaluate blood flow to both legs comprehensively while ruling out peripheral artery disease exacerbating poor wound healing in this case. A complete blood count was also assessed to determine any leukocytosis, suggesting a systemic inflammatory response.  Simultaneously, appropriate wound care measures were initiated for Ms.Y's right foot ulceration. This included gentle cleansing with normal saline and application of moist sterile dressings, with instructions provided for adequate off-loading through the use of pressure-relieving footwear.  Given the complexity of her case and the need for collaborative management between multiple specialties, a multidisciplinary team consisting of a diabetologist, vascular surgeon, wound care specialist, and an infectious disease expert was constituted to devise an integrated treatment plan for Ms.Y.  After obtaining arterial Doppler study results indicating no significant arterial compromise in both legs and ruling out peripheral artery disease as a contributing factor to non-healing wounds in this scenario, our suspicion towards deeper infectious involvement within soft tissues increased. To confirm our diagnosis and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy selection based on bacterial sensitivity results from deep tissue samples when required later on if deemed necessary accordingly at expert discretion; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled to assess any fascial plane involvement or abscess formation below the visible ulcerations as warranted clinically.  A comprehensive management strategy addressing both systemic factors such as glycemic control optimization alongside specialized local wound care techniques aimed towards healing promotion will be implemented once MRI findings are available while basing therapeutic decisions considering individual patient preferences tailored mutually by involved experts including utmost respect given unto personal choices shared willingly by each patient during informed consent process remembered adamantly throughout course concerning spiritual beliefs or moral values inadvertently impacting medical approaches chosen jointly remaining paramount acknowledging implementer patient partnership maintain health outcomes maximize successfully aiding recovery emphasizing overall well-being inclusive preservation harmonizing mind body soul wellness milestones achieved gradually jointly prioritized ongoing till goals fulfilled fulfilling compassionate commitment consistently given forthrightly Ms. Y's multidimensional needs remain steadfastly unwavering focused attaining highest level attainable engaging actively each stage therapeutic alliance fostered along seamless continuity nurtured preserving dignity fostering adversities solace render optimizing mankind-centered healing environment construed patient’s fervent prayers seeking exemplary care encounter envisioned propelling successful outcomes hitherto globally esteemed standards clinical professionalism guided sacredly besides evidential scientific principles interwoven subtly weaving tapestry holistic well-becoming remembering embodiment compassion extending generously perpetually anatomic transcendentmagnum opus emblematically encapsulating enveloped indivisible continuum centered exemplification nursing practice symbiotic intertwined therapeutic collaborations consistently countenancing flawless sumptuous nurture offered personifies noble arts par excellence emulating supreme humanistic paradigms woven luminous fabric lifeworlds all embracing beneficiates embodying finest endowments bestowed ensuring attunement inherently resonate dwelling fabulously enduring scriptures basic ethos abiding altruistically known only ever cherish profoundly yet yonder elusive horizons whereon noblest purposes abide transcendentally united eternally.",create
"Case Study: A 35-year-old Male with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction  Introduction: A 35-year-old male presented to the orofacial pain and temporomandibular dysfunction unit of the university medical dental clinic with a persistent complaint of limited mouth opening and facial pain over the past year. The patient's deteriorating condition was causing significant discomfort, affecting his daily activities, and leading to decreased quality of life.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reported experiencing pain in his jaw joint area on both sides, specifically in the pre-auricular regions. Additionally, he described masticatory myalgia that was more pronounced in his masseter muscles. He expressed difficulty while chewing food due to this prolonged stiffness and noted that it persisted for several hours after waking up in the morning. The discomfort seemed to worsen during functional movements involving the jaw joint.  Medical History: The patient had no history of trauma or infection involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). However, he did suffer from systemic sclerosis (SSc) since early adulthood, which primarily affected his skin but also involved some internal organs. SSc-related symptoms such as Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers had been managed previously with vasodilators under rheumatology care.  Clinical Assessment: On examination, it was observed that the patient had limited mouth opening, reaching only 25 mm interincisally compared to a normal mouth opening range of approximately 40-50 mm. There were no evident signs of facial asymmetry or swelling overlying TMJ areas upon visual inspection.  Palpation revealed bilateral tenderness in pre-auricular areas below both zygomatic arches - an indication of TMJ involvement. Further palpation confirmed increased muscle tension and tenderness bilaterally along with trigger points found within masseter muscles during contraction.  Additional diagnostic tests were performed:  1. Radiographic Evaluation: Orthopantomogram (OPG) was conducted to rule out any bony abnormalities or osteoarthritic changes within the TMJ and surrounding structures. The radiograph showed no significant degenerative signs or condylar abnormalities, confirming that the patient's symptoms were more muscular in nature.  2. Imaging of TMJ: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrated joint disc displacement in both right and left TMJ with a reduction beyond the midsagittal plane during mouth opening movements. There were no other structural anomalies observed.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical assessment and diagnostic results, a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) was made for this patient. The likely cause of TMD was determined to be muscle hyperactivity within the masticatory muscles, particularly the masseter, leading to pain and restricted jaw movement.  Treatment Plan: Considering the severity of symptoms and functional limitations experienced by the patient, a multidisciplinary approach was recommended:  1. Pharmacological Management: The patient was prescribed a short course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.   2. Physical Therapy: A referral for physical therapy sessions focusing on stretching exercises for jaw muscles along with moist heat applications over affected areas was arranged.  3. Occlusal Appliance Therapy: To provide additional support and relieve stress on his jaw joints, a custom-fit occlusal splint was fabricated for nighttime use.  4. Patient Education: The importance of maintaining good oral hygiene practices along with dietary modifications involving soft food consumption during acute episodes compounded by SSc symptoms were emphasized.  5. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits were planned to monitor progress, make necessary adjustments in treatment plans, and ensure optimal management of his condition.  Conclusion: This case highlights how temporomandibular joint dysfunction can manifest alongside systemic sclerosis in an adult male patient presenting with limited mouth opening and facial pain. Timely diagnosis, collaborative treatment, and patient education play key roles in managing TMD effectively, enabling the restoration of function and improvement in quality of life for patients.  Note: This is a fictitious clinical case study created for educational purposes. Any resemblance to actual patients or their medical conditions is purely coincidental.",create
"We present here a case of a 1-month-old infant who presented with multiple facial injuries. The baby was previously in good health until his mother noticed unusual crying and blood on the right side of his face approximately 2 hours prior to arrival at our clinic. On closer examination, she observed complete loss of the right upper and lower eyelids, partial loss of the nostrils, and an ulcerated lesion on the right cheek. There were no witnesses to the incident that led to these injuries. According to the mother's recollection, about 1 hour before the incident occurred, she had breastfed her child and then placed him in a stroller near a table about 80cm from the ground.  The patient's name is Eric, a term-born male infant who has been healthy since birth. He was delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery at full-term without any complications noted during or after birth. His Apgar scores were normal (9 at one minute and 10 at five minutes). Eric is currently being exclusively breastfed by his mother and gaining weight appropriately.  Upon examination, Eric appeared irritable and demonstrated signs of distress throughout our evaluation. We found significant facial deformities consistent with what was described by his mother earlier. Loss of both upper and lower eyelids on the right side resulted in exposure keratopathy as evidenced by decreased corneal reflexes upon stimulation with a cotton swab.  Further assessment revealed partial loss of tissue around both nostrils leading to noticeable asymmetry when compared to his left nostril. The ulcerated lesion on Eric's right cheek seemed deep but not actively bleeding at that moment.  Cerebral imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan were performed promptly due to concerns for possible underlying craniofacial abnormalities contributing to these severe injuries; however, they did not reveal any significant findings apart from localized soft tissue destruction involving only superficial layers.  Considering several plausible etiologies for these injuries, we engaged in a thorough discussion with Eric's mother to elicit any relevant historical information. She denied any incidents involving blunt force trauma or falls from a height. There was no suggestive history of household pets, chemical exposures, or previous contact with individuals affected by infectious diseases.  Given the significant clinical findings and absence of an apparent cause for the injuries, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to provide comprehensive care for Eric. The involvement of specialists including pediatric surgery, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, and dermatology allowed us to create an individualized management plan based on his unique needs.  Treatment included sterile wound care using moist dressings and topical antibiotic ointment to promote healing and prevent infection. Eye lubricants were prescribed to combat dryness caused by loss of eyelid protection. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor his progress closely.  As part of the evaluation process encompassing child welfare concerns in these cases, our medical team arranged psycho-social supportive measures for Eric's family while actively involving appropriate child protection services who are essential stakeholders in safeguarding the well-being of all infants under their jurisdiction.  In conclusion, Eric presented with multiple facial injuries characterized by loss of upper and lower eyelids on one side along with partial tissue destruction involving nostrils and a cheek ulceration. Despite extensive evaluation including imaging studies ruling out underlying craniofacial abnormalities contributing to these injuries, no specific etiology could be identified at this stage. Close interdisciplinary collaboration has been instituted to optimize medical management while addressing potential psychosocial factors associated with this unusual presentation in early infancy.",create
"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our department in September 2021 with a complaint of a lump in her right breast. She reported noticing the lump three months prior, which had gradually increased in size. The patient denied any associated pain, nipple discharge, or changes in breast contour.  On physical examination, a firm, non-tender mass measuring approximately 4 cm was palpable in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. There were no signs of skin changes, nipple retraction, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The contralateral breast appeared normal upon examination.  Given the worrisome findings on clinical examination, further investigations were warranted to determine the nature and extent of the mass. A mammogram and subsequent ultrasound were performed to evaluate the lesion further.  The mammogram revealed an irregular density suggestive of a solid mass with speculated margins within the right upper outer quadrant. The ultrasound confirmed the presence of an irregular hypoechoic nodule with posterior acoustic shadowing and microcalcifications suspicious for malignancy.  In light of these findings and considering age-appropriate guidelines for comprehensive evaluation, additional imaging studies were carried out to assess for locoregional as well as distant spread of disease while ruling out primary tumor involvement elsewhere.  A chest X-ray showed clear lung fields without any evidence of pulmonary nodules or infiltration. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated no liver lesions or gallbladder pathology; furthermore, there were no pancreatic abnormalities noted during visualization using this modality. Normal spleen size and architecture were visualized along with unremarkable kidneys bilaterally without evidence of tumor infiltration or hydronephrosis. Lastly, ureteric peristalsis was normal along its course through both pelvicalyceal systems down to their junctions with urinary bladder that also appeared unremarkable during ultrasound assessment.  After obtaining informed consent from our patient highlighting potential benefits versus associated risks/complications from surgery like sample-taking diagnostic procedures, a core biopsy of the breast mass was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of an invasive ductal carcinoma with corresponding grade 2/III associated microcalcifications.  Given the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma, pretreatment staging assessment was pursued to determine disease extent and guide subsequent management decisions. A bone scan revealed no evidence of skeletal metastasis or areas suggestive of increased metabolic activity in osseous structures.  In summary, a 65-year-old woman presented with a palpable lump in her right breast characterized by imaging studies as an irregular hypoechoic nodule suspicious for malignancy. Extensive imaging evaluation including abdominal ultrasound ruled out primary tumor involvement elsewhere. Core biopsy confirmed an invasive ductal carcinoma with associated microcalcifications. Subsequent bone scan excluded bony metastasis.  The patient's case was discussed at our multi-disciplinary tumor board meeting to develop an individualized treatment plan tailored to her specific needs and disease characteristics. Based on the tumor board's recommendations, the next step in our patient's management was to determine the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of her breast cancer, as these factors played a crucial role in tailoring the therapeutic approach.  Immunohistochemistry testing revealed that the tumor cells were negative for both ER and PR expression. Further analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated amplification of HER2 gene signals, confirming HER2-positive status. These findings indicated that our patient's breast cancer showed aggressive features and would benefit from targeted therapy against HER2.  Considering this information, systemic staging investigations were performed to determine any distant metastasis. A whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan was conducted to assess distant organ involvement.  The PET-CT scan showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake within multiple lymph nodes along the right axilla, suggesting locoregional lymphadenopathy consistent with nodal involvement. However, there were no signs of distant metastasis to other organs or structures observed on imaging studies.  The comprehensive staging results indicated stage IIIA breast cancer based on tumor size (>4 cm), clinical nodal involvement, and absence of distant metastasis. Taking into account this advanced stage at presentation and aggressive molecular profile of HER2-positive disease status with hormone receptor negativity, our patient qualified for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery as per standard treatment guidelines.  After discussing all treatment options along with their potential benefits and risks, our patient consented for neoadjuvant chemotherapy aimed at downstaging her tumor before considering surgical intervention.  She was initiated on a combination regimen consisting of docetaxel and trastuzumab every three weeks for six cycles. Close monitoring was maintained throughout chemotherapy to evaluate treatment response using clinical examination combined with periodic imaging studies, including breast ultrasound and physical examination.  Following completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, restaging studies confirmed a significant reduction in the size of the primary tumor. The lump was no longer palpable on clinical examination. Moreover, imaging evaluation showed a decrease in axillary lymphadenopathy, suggesting excellent response to treatment.  Given this favorable response to chemotherapy, our patient subsequently underwent right-sided modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an absence of residual invasive carcinoma within the breast tissue and no involvement of any resected lymph nodes.  Postoperatively, she was referred to radiation oncology for adjuvant radiotherapy to further reduce local recurrence risk at both chest wall and regional nodal basins based on clinical and pathological characteristics.  In conclusion, our 65-year-old female patient presented with a palpable lump in her right breast that was found to be an invasive ductal carcinoma upon histopathological examination. Extensive staging investigations ruled out distant metastasis while core biopsy profiling indicated HER2-positive disease with hormone receptor negativity. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a significant tumor response allowing for curative surgical intervention followed by adjuvant radiotherapy as part of her comprehensive treatment plan moving forward.  The multidisciplinary team will continue monitoring her closely during regular follow-up visits to ensure appropriate surveillance and early detection of any potential recurrence or side effects related to previous treatments while providing ongoing support throughout her cancer journey.",create
"Ms. ABC, a 58-year-old retired librarian, was referred to our unit for further evaluation and management of her recent gynecological symptoms. She presented with a history of irregular, painless vaginal bleeding that had been ongoing for the past six months. Upon referral, she had already undergone an endometrial biopsy at a secondary hospital.  Ms. ABC's medical history revealed that she reached menopause at the age of 49 and has been postmenopausal for the past nine years. She has been sexually inactive for the last ten years and denies any prior use of contraception or hormone replacement therapy. There is no known history of sexually transmitted infections.  Her first menstrual period started at age 13, and she never experienced any significant gynecological problems during her reproductive years. She has not previously undergone Pap smear cervical cytology testing.  On physical examination, Ms. ABC appeared well-nourished with no apparent signs of distress or discomfort. Her vital signs were within normal limits, including blood pressure (120/80 mmHg) and heart rate (70 beats per minute). A comprehensive gynecological examination revealed no palpable masses or tenderness upon gentle palpation of the lower abdomen.  The results from her recent endometrial biopsy indicated the presence of abnormal cells suggestive of cellular atypia but did not definitively confirm any specific diagnosis.  Given these findings and in adherence to clinical protocols to rule out potential malignancy, additional investigations were planned for Ms. ABC to determine the origin and extent of her symptoms.  A pelvic ultrasound was ordered to evaluate both the uterine cavity and adnexa in order to visualize any potential anomalies or suspicious lesions within these structures that may explain her ongoing vaginal bleeding.  Furthermore, laboratory investigations were initiated including a complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile (prothrombin time & activated partial thromboplastin time), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function tests (serum creatinine and electrolytes). These investigations aimed to assess the overall health status of Ms. ABC, as well as provide valuable information regarding her coagulation profile prior to considering any potential interventions or surgical procedures.  A consultation with a gynecologic oncologist was also arranged to further evaluate the biopsy results and ensure appropriate follow-up for Ms. ABC's case. The gynecologic oncology specialist would play a crucial role in discussing the management options with the patient, providing guidance on potential treatment regimens, and determining whether further tissue sampling or alternative diagnostic procedures are necessary.  In conclusion, Ms. ABC's presentation of irregular vaginal bleeding warrants a thorough investigation to identify any underlying causes. Her age, postmenopausal status, absence of sexual activity or prior cervical cytology testing necessitate careful consideration of various possible diagnoses ranging from benign conditions such as uterine polyps or hormone imbalances to potentially more serious pathologies like endometrial cancer. Further diagnostic workup will be critical in determining an accurate diagnosis and guiding appropriate management tailored specifically for Ms. ABC's condition. Following the initial investigations performed for Ms. ABC, the pelvic ultrasound revealed a thickened endometrial lining measuring 11mm, suggestive of endometrial hyperplasia. However, no visible masses or abnormal structures were observed within the uterine cavity or adnexa.  Based on these findings, an outpatient hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure were scheduled to obtain a more definitive diagnosis and provide therapeutic intervention as necessary. The D&C would allow for the collection of tissue samples from the inner lining of the uterus to further evaluate any cellular abnormalities.  Prior to proceeding with the D&C procedure, Ms. ABC underwent routine preoperative assessments including a detailed medical history review and thorough physical examination by an anesthesiologist to ensure she was fit for anesthesia administration.  During the hysteroscopy and subsequent D&C, our team visualized a small polypoid lesion originating from within the endometrial cavity. The lesion appeared suspicious upon visual inspection due to its irregular surface characteristics and slightly friable nature. Samples of this lesion were collected for histopathological analysis through biopsy forceps during hysteroscopic resection.  Postoperatively, Ms. ABC recovered well without any immediate complications. Analgesics were prescribed as needed for pain management in case she experienced any discomfort following the procedure.  The histopathology report confirmed that the polypoid lesion removed from Ms. ABC's endometrium was indeed an atypical complex hyperplasia with focal areas of cellular crowding suggestive of carcinoma in situ (CIS). This finding raised concern over possible underlying malignancy within her endometrium.  A multidisciplinary meeting involving gynecologic oncologists, pathologists specialized in uterine pathology interpretation, radiologists familiar with imaging findings related to gynecological malignancies, as well as members of our clinical team was held to discuss these results thoroughly and develop an appropriate management plan.  Given the presence of atypical complex hyperplasia with areas suspicious for CIS, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was scheduled to assess for any potential metastatic spread or lymph node involvement. This imaging modality would help determine the appropriate staging of Ms. ABC's condition.  To further refine the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of her disease within the uterus, an expert opinion was sought from a gynecological pathologist specializing in uterine neoplasms to review her pathology slides. The expert pathologist confirmed high-grade endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-EIN) with focal areas suspicious for early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma.  Ms. ABC was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with a gynecologic oncologist to discuss treatment options based on her comprehensive assessment results. As part of her management plan, surgical intervention in the form of total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) along with lymphadenectomy would be considered to achieve optimal disease control depending on staging findings obtained from CT scan results.  In conclusion, Ms. ABC's diagnosis advanced from endometrial hyperplasia detected during initial investigations to high-grade endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-EIN) suggestive of early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma upon further evaluation. Collaborative efforts between various specialists including gynecologists, pathologists specialized in uterine neoplasms interpretation, radiologists familiar with gynecological malignancies imaging features were essential in guiding evidence-based decision-making regarding appropriate interventions based on staging information provided by imaging studies and pathology expertise obtained through biopsy analysis conducted during hysteroscopic resection procedures performed earlier on this case.

"We present the case of a 35-year-old patient with a medical history of hypertension, obesity, and a family history of coronary artery disease in both parents. The patient was diagnosed with heart failure five years ago when he experienced shortness of breath and fatigue while doing minimal physical activities. Since then, he has been closely monitored by our cardiology team.  The patient's clinical presentation has been consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Echocardiographic findings revealed significant left ventricular dilation (estimated at 60mm) along with reduced systolic function indicated by an ejection fraction of 35%. In addition, the echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.  To further investigate the underlying etiology of his dilated cardiomyopathy, a detailed family history was taken. It was uncovered that his father had suffered from sudden cardiac death at the age of 47 without any known causative factors identified at that time. Given this information, our suspicion regarding potential genetic associations increased significantly.  An extensive workup was initiated to identify any possible inherited arrhythmogenic conditions or genetic anomalies related to DCM in this young patient. Genetic testing for dystrophinopathies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Becker muscular dystrophy, revealed no abnormalities. However, further analysis targeting other relevant familial cardiomyopathy variants is underway.  The clinical examination also included various non-invasive diagnostic procedures apart from genetically directed tests. A stress test was performed to evaluate the presence of exercise-induced arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia causing reduced ventricular function. During stress testing on a cycle ergometer protocol up to peak workload levels as per Bruce protocol standards; there were no significant electrocardiogram changes observed except for occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) noted during recovery periods.  Further evaluation using advanced imaging modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted to assess ventricular function, myocardial scarring, and the presence of fibrosis or inflammatory changes. The cardiac MRI revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and late gadolinium enhancement consistent with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.  To manage the patient's condition effectively, a multifaceted approach was adopted. Medical therapy included guideline-based pharmacological intervention primarily focused on optimizing heart failure management. A combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists were implemented to attenuate myocardial remodeling and improve systolic function.  The patient has been advised regarding lifestyle modifications, emphasizing weight reduction through regular physical exercise and dietary adjustments that aim to minimize sodium intake while incorporating adequate amounts of essential electrolytes and vitamins. Furthermore, close monitoring through routine follow-up visits with regular echocardiographic assessments have been scheduled for assessing treatment response.  In conclusion, this clinical presentation highlights the case of a young patient diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular dilation and reduced systolic function. While genetic screening revealed no dystrophinopathies initially, further testing is being pursued to identify any occult familial cardiomyopathy variants that may provide insight into this patient's disease etiology. Compliance with holistic management strategies including pharmacotherapy optimization and lifestyle modifications coupled with careful follow-up will be crucial in improving the patient's long-term outcomes. During the patient's follow-up visits, he reported occasional palpitations and a feeling of skipped heartbeats. To further investigate these symptoms, a 24-hour Holter monitoring was ordered. The Holter monitoring revealed frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) throughout the day, occurring mainly during periods of physical exertion or emotional stress.  Given the findings from the Holter monitoring, there was a concern for potential ventricular arrhythmias and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). To confirm this suspicion, an exercise stress test was performed to provoke arrhythmias while closely monitoring electrocardiographic changes.  During the exercise stress test, there were no significant abnormalities noted in the patient's response to increased physical activity. However, PVCs continued to be present but did not exceed alarming thresholds in duration or frequency.  To further evaluate for ARVD as a possible cause for these palpitations and PVCs, additional diagnostic tests were ordered. A high amplification electrocardiogram with signal-averaging was performed to assess for late potentials - low amplitude signals appearing at late stages that may indicate ventricular tachycardia risk.  The high amplification electrocardiogram revealed subtle fragmented signals within QRS complexes known as late potentials suggestive of potential electrical instability within the myocardium. These findings raised suspicion for ARVD and warranted more comprehensive evaluation using cardiac imaging modalities.  A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with gadolinium contrast was scheduled to assess structural abnormalities within both ventricles that are characteristic of ARVD. This non-invasive imaging technique allows visualization of myocardial tissue architecture along with identification of any fibrofatty infiltrations or aneurysmal dilations.  The MRI results demonstrated evidence of right ventricular dilation consistent with ARVD criteria according to revised task force criteria guidelines. In addition, delayed gadolinium enhancement patterns indicative of fibrofatty replacement within the right ventricle were observed. These findings provided further confirmation of ARVD diagnosis in this patient.  With the establishment of ARVD as an underlying cause for his palpitations and ventricular arrhythmias, a management plan focusing on arrhythmia control and prevention was initiated. The patient was prescribed antiarrhythmic medications, specifically beta-blockers, to suppress ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk of sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death.  In addition to medical therapy, lifestyle modifications were recommended to mitigate potential triggers for arrhythmias. The patient was advised to limit alcohol consumption, avoid intense competitive sports or activities that may exacerbate arrhythmias, and maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise and a balanced diet.  Regular follow-up visits were scheduled every three months to assess treatment response and monitor disease progression. Electrocardiograms were obtained during each visit to evaluate any changes in PVC burden or morphology that may require further intervention.  In conclusion, this case illustrates the diagnostic journey of a young patient with dilated cardiomyopathy initially thought to be idiopathic but later identified as ARVD due to persistent palpitations, PVCs on Holter monitoring, late potentials on high amplification electrocardiogram, and characteristic imaging findings of right ventricular dilation with fibrofatty replacement on MRI scan. A comprehensive management strategy encompassing antiarrhythmic medications along with lifestyle modifications forms the cornerstone for optimizing this patient's long-term outcomes while minimizing risks associated with ARVD-related arrhythmias and complications.",create
"Clinical Case: A 25-year-old woman, child of unrelated parents, presented to our consultation complaining of progressive muscle weakness and speech difficulties. The patient first noticed the symptoms approximately five years ago when she experienced difficulty in walking long distances without experiencing fatigue and muscle cramps. Over time, her ability to walk deteriorated further, eventually leading to the complete loss of ambulation.  On thorough examination, it was evident that the patient exhibited an unusually slow gait and had a marked lack of balance. She had also developed dystonia in both upper and lower limbs with involuntary twisting movements during certain tasks such as writing or grasping objects. Other noticeable symptoms included frequent episodes of rotatory nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) and slurred speech.  The initial workup revealed several abnormalities consistent with a neurological disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed signal abnormalities within the central gray nucleus of the brain, particularly involving areas associated with motor function. Additionally, genetic testing revealed no evidence of common neuromuscular disorders such as muscular dystrophy or myasthenia gravis.  Based on these findings and a thorough patient history review, we reached a working diagnosis of Leigh syndrome - a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. We decided to conduct further investigations aiming to confirm this diagnosis.  Apart from the physical symptoms suggestive of Leigh syndrome found during clinical examination, which were now evident for more than five years; there were additional biographical indices that supported this diagnosis in our patient's case as well. It was discovered that two siblings from her mother's previous pregnancy died shortly after birth due to unexplained conditions which could possibly be attributed to some form of mitochondrial disease.   Following this evaluation process which involved an in-depth discussion with both parents about their family history regarding other members who may have similar clinical presentation or demise at an early age; we reclassified our initial diagnosis as confirmed Leigh syndrome.  At present, the patient has been started on symptomatic treatment in order to alleviate some of the distressing symptoms she experiences. L-Dopa has been prescribed as a palliative option for the severe extra pyramidal symptoms associated with Leigh syndrome. This strategy aims to minimize muscle spasms, tremors, and enhance motor function to improve overall quality of life.  Leigh syndrome continues to pose significant challenges for patients and their families due to its progressive nature and impact on various aspects of daily functioning. Consequently, our patient was unable to pursue her higher education due to difficulties in speech and movement.  Our management plan involves regular follow-up appointments with specialists from various disciplines such as neurology, physical therapy, speech therapy, nutrition, and psychology. The interdisciplinary approach ensures comprehensive care tailored specifically to each individual's needs.  We are dedicated to providing ongoing support both for our patient suffering from Leigh syndrome as well as their family members affected by this rare disorder. Genetic counseling has also been offered with a focus on guiding individuals who may be at risk for having children affected by similar mitochondrial disorders.  In conclusion, this case demonstrates the challenges faced by individuals with Leigh syndrome. It underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing such complex neurological conditions while emphasizing the need for ongoing research efforts aimed at understanding these rare disorders further.""",create
"Clinical Case: An Imaginary Patient with Complex Presentation  Introduction: Our clinical case revolves around a 12-year-old boy, born prematurely at 33 weeks of gestation to a mother who experienced preeclampsia during her pregnancy. The birth was accomplished via emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress, and the baby weighed 2,150 grams at delivery with a length of 43 cm. In the neonatal period, the patient demonstrated various congenital anomalies and presented with an array of symptoms that puzzled the healthcare team.  Case History: The neonate initially showed signs of hypotonia and poor feeding. Physical examination revealed dolichocephaly and hepatosplenomegaly, raising concerns about potential underlying conditions. Further investigations were carried out to evaluate these abnormalities comprehensively.  Diagnostic Evaluation: An ophthalmologic evaluation uncovered bilateral vision impairment characterized by amaurosis or absent visual response. Additionally, X-rays displayed abnormal osteosclerotic bone changes throughout his skeleton, indicating potential skeletal dysplasia or bone-related anomalies. Hematologic aberrations were also evident in laboratory findings including mild anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Diagnosis: Given the constellation of clinical features observed in our patient, a diagnosis of osteopetrosis was established based on radiographic findings and hematologic abnormalities encountered during diagnostic workup. Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective osteoclast function leading to impaired bone resorption and subsequent dense skeletal structure formation.  Management: Corticosteroid therapy was promptly initiated for our patient upon reaching an accurate diagnosis in order to alleviate symptoms associated with impaired bone metabolism as well as stabilize hematologic parameters affected by this condition.  Progression & Complications: Throughout his childhood years following diagnosis, our young patient exhibited relative stability concerning his medical condition until November 2019 when he developed swelling localized to the right mandible area consistent with osteomyelitis. Given the severity of his symptoms, our patient required surgical intervention involving drainage and debridement of the affected area.  Post-treatment Outcome: Following surgical intervention for osteomyelitis, our patient demonstrated a gradual improvement in localized swelling and associated symptoms. Close monitoring was implemented to ensure appropriate healing without any signs of recurrent infection. The importance of long-term follow-up was emphasized to evaluate potential complications related to osteomyelitis such as bone deformities or chronic infection.  Conclusion: Our engaging case revolves around a 12-year-old boy with a history of prematurity born to a mother with preeclampsia during pregnancy. The complex presentation included dolichocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, amaurosis, skeletal abnormalities on X-ray, and hematologic aberrations indicative of osteopetrosis - an uncommon genetic disorder affecting bone metabolism. Corticosteroid therapy was instituted following diagnosis while later requiring surgical management for osteomyelitis. Establishing an accurate diagnosis alongside managing individual symptoms continues to outline the way forward in improving his quality of life and ensuring optimal outcomes in this intriguing clinical scenario.  Word Count: 457 words Follow-Up and Long-Term Care:  Subsequent to the surgical intervention for osteomyelitis, our patient was diligently monitored to assess his healing progress and manage any complications that might arise. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled not only to evaluate the outcome of the surgical procedure but also to monitor his overall health and development.  During these follow-up visits, it became evident that our patient continued to manifest certain challenges related to his underlying condition of osteopetrosis. Specifically, he experienced delayed growth milestones compared to his peers due to limited bone remodeling resulting from impaired osteoclast activity. To address this concern, a multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist, nutritionist, and physical therapist was implemented.  The endocrinologist meticulously assessed the patient's hormonal profile and initiated appropriate therapeutic interventions for growth hormone deficiency as well as other associated hormonal imbalances. The nutritionist played a vital role in formulating a tailored dietary plan fortified with essential nutrients required for optimal bone health such as calcium and vitamin D.  Additionally, regular physical therapy sessions were incorporated into our patient's treatment plan with the aim of promoting muscular strength and mobility while minimizing joint contractures which often occur due to limited movement associated with skeletal abnormalities characteristic of osteopetrosis.  Despite concerted efforts by healthcare professionals involved in managing his care, our patient encountered occasional complications throughout his journey which required prompt intervention. These complications included recurrent respiratory infections due to impaired airway clearance secondary to thoracic deformities observed in osteopetrosis patients. Appropriate antibiotic therapy coupled with pulmonary hygiene techniques formed an integral part of managing these respiratory challenges successfully.  Furthermore, radiographic surveillance was consistently undertaken at regular intervals not only for monitoring disease progression but also evaluating potential bone-related complications such as fractures or spinal anomalies that may arise during childhood development.  Through comprehensive long-term care involving close collaboration between various specialties including orthopedics, ophthalmology, endocrinology, nutritionist services among others; our patient experienced a relatively stable course despite the complexities associated with his condition.  Conclusion:  Our fascinating clinical case involves the complex journey of a now 15-year-old boy diagnosed with osteopetrosis. From his initial presentation with congenital anomalies including dolichocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and amaurosis; to the subsequent diagnosis of osteopetrosis based on radiographic and hematologic findings, this case has provided numerous challenges for healthcare professionals involved in the management of his care.  This fictitious patient's story highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach given the comprehensive nature of symptoms and complications associated with osteopetrosis. The collaborative efforts by various medical specialists coupled with appropriate therapeutic interventions encompassing corticosteroid therapy, surgical management for osteomyelitis, growth hormone treatment, nutritional optimization and physical therapy have all contributed to stabilizing his condition and enabling him to grow despite significant skeletal anomalies.  Continued vigilance through regular monitoring and timely intervention remains crucial in addressing potential complications that may arise throughout childhood development. As we continue to navigate this captivating clinical scenario together, our steadfast commitment remains centered on optimizing outcomes and enhancing quality of life for our extraordinary patient.

"Case Study: A 42-Year-Old Engineer with Gross Hematuria  We present a hypothetical case of a 42-year-old engineer who presented to the urology clinic at a tertiary care hospital with a four-week history of gross hematuria. The patient reported observing bright red blood in his urine on multiple occasions during this period, prompting him to seek medical attention. He denied experiencing any associated symptoms such as pain, dysuria, frequency, or urgency.  The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension five years earlier and was prescribed oral antihypertensive medications. However, he admitted to irregular medication adherence and infrequent follow-up visits with his primary care physician due to work commitments.  There was no history of genitourinary trauma or recent urologic procedures. Additionally, the patient denied any lower urinary tract symptoms or changes in bowel habits. There were no constitutional symptoms like weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats suggestive of systemic illness.  On physical examination, the patient appeared generally well and oriented to time, place, and person. Vitals signs were within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed no palpable masses or tenderness upon deep palpation. Digital rectal examination (DRE) did not reveal any abnormal findings such as nodules or asymmetry in the prostate gland.  Given the persistent gross hematuria without associated urinary tract symptoms in our patient's clinical presentation along with his hypertension diagnosis and inconsistent antihypertensive therapy adherence over time; further investigations were warranted.  Initial laboratory investigations included a complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests (RFTs), liver function tests (LFTs), coagulation profile assessment; all of which demonstrated values within normal limits except for an elevated serum creatinine level at 1.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). A urinalysis revealed numerous red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field, along with the absence of white blood cells and casts.  To further evaluate the source of hematuria, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) urogram was performed. The CT urogram demonstrated no calculi or masses in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. However, it revealed a filling defect in the left renal pelvis suggestive of a possible tumor. Subsequent cystoscopy demonstrated normal findings within the urinary bladder.  Considering the radiological findings and persistent gross hematuria without an identifiable cause, we referred our patient to a urologic oncologist for further evaluation and management of a suspected renal malignancy. The patient underwent left-sided partial nephrectomy during which histopathological examination confirmed renal cell carcinoma as the underlying etiology for his symptoms.  Postoperatively, his gross hematuria resolved completely without any immediate complications related to surgery or subsequent follow-up visits.  In summary, we present here an imaginary clinical case of a 42-year-old engineer with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria and inconsistent hypertension management that ultimately led to the diagnosis and successful treatment of renal cell carcinoma after surgical intervention. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough investigation when evaluating patients who present with persistent gross hematuria despite their apparently harmless clinical presentation.  Case Study: A 33-Year-Old Teacher with Painful Hematospermia  We report an imaginary case of a 33-year-old teacher who presented to the urology clinic at a teaching hospital with a two-week history of painful hematospermia. The patient reported experiencing three episodes during this period in which his ejaculate was visibly stained with bright red blood. There were no associated symptoms of urinary urgency, urge incontinence, or dysuria.  The patient had been diagnosed with essential hypertension eight months prior but had been irregular in taking his prescribed oral antihypertensive medications and attending follow-up clinic visits due to work commitments. He denied any recent trauma to the genital region or prostate gland.  During physical examination, the patient appeared generally well and fully oriented. His vital signs were within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg. Abdominal examination did not reveal any palpable abnormalities or tenderness on deep palpation. Digital rectal examination (DRE) revealed a smooth and symmetrical prostate gland without any nodules or indurations.  Given the persistent painful hematospermia in our patient's clinical presentation, coupled with his history of irregular hypertension management, further investigations were warranted to determine its underlying cause.  Initial laboratory investigations including a complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests (RFTs), liver function tests (LFTs), and coagulation profile yielded results within normal ranges except for mildly elevated serum creatinine levels at 1.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria without significant proteinuria.  To further evaluate the source of painful hematospermia, an ultrasound examination was performed on both the scrotum and prostate gland concurrently to assess for any structural abnormalities or evidence of infection/inflammation; both ultrasounds returned normal findings.  To better delineate the cause of our patient's symptoms, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test was ordered to assess for any potential malignancy or prostatitis. The PSA level returned within the normal range at 0.8 ng/mL (normal range: 0-4 ng/mL), thereby making prostate carcinoma less likely.  Given the ongoing symptoms and inconclusive investigations, we referred the patient for further evaluation by a urologist specialized in ejaculatory disorders and male fertility. Subsequently, he underwent a more specialized examination known as a semen analysis – an evaluation of his seminal fluid parameters that include sperm count, motility, and morphology. The semen analysis revealed elevated levels of white blood cells with no significant abnormalities identified in the sperm parameters.  Suspicion of chronic prostatitis was raised based on these findings; therefore, empirical treatment with appropriate antibiotics covering common pathogens associated with prostatic infections was initiated. Follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor symptom resolution and investigate possible underlying factors contributing to chronic prostatic inflammation.  In summary, we present here an imaginary clinical case of a 33-year-old teacher who presented with painful hematospermia alongside inconsistent hypertension management. Despite inconclusive initial investigations, through multidisciplinary collaboration involving specialized urologic expertise dedicated to ejaculatory disorders and male fertility evaluations; suspicion was raised for chronic prostatitis as an underlying etiology for his symptoms. By starting empirical antibiotic therapy targeting common infectious agents associated with chronic prostatic inflammation, we aim to alleviate his pain while monitoring his condition closely in order to optimize treatment outcomes.  This theoretical case highlights the importance of considering various causes when evaluating patients presenting with painful hematospermia even in seemingly benign clinical scenarios that could potentially lead to timely diagnosis and tailored management strategies.

"Case Presentation 2: A 36-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a comminuted fracture of the left radius and ulna, as well as a wrist dislocation. He sustained the injury during a motorcycle accident when he collided with another vehicle. Upon arrival at the hospital, he presented with significant swelling and external deformity of his left forearm.   Physical examination revealed tenderness over the distal forearm, increased pain upon movement, and limited range of motion in both the wrist joint and fingers. The patient's neurovascular status was intact, with no signs of sensory or motor deficit.  Radiographic imaging confirmed the presence of multiple fractures involving both bones in the distal third region. The fracture pattern suggested extensive fragmentation with angulation at the site. Additionally, there was evidence of joint displacement on X-ray imaging.  Due to a high risk for infection associated with an open fracture like this case involved, it was determined that open reduction would be more appropriate than closed reduction for this patient's complex injury. After discussing treatment options and obtaining informed consent from the patient, surgical intervention under general anesthesia was planned.  Intraoperatively, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to mitigate any potential risk of infection given that it is an open fracture case too. Following sterile preparation and draping techniques,the surgeon made an incision along Langer's lines to gain access to the fractured bone segments through a carefully chosen extensile approach ensuring excellent visualization  Careful reduction maneuvers were conducted once optimal exposure had been obtained - anatomical realignment followed by stabilization using multiple fixation devices including orthogonal plates- one plate on each bone—radius and ulna—in order to provide adequate stability for optimal healing.  Postoperatively,the limb was immobilized using plaster casts combining above- elbow backslab cast type . Adequate padding primarily for bony prominences points like elbow but also careful molding around fingers if terminal casting point allows coverage thorougly — to maintain reduction and provide support for the injured area during the initial healing phase. The patient was instructed on proper elevation techniques for final cast placement.  Postoperative radiographs showed satisfactory reduction with optimal alignment of bone fragments and successful stabilization by internal fixation. The patient was advised regarding early mobilization exercises and warned about potential complications such as nerve injury, implant failure or malunion.  While in hospital care,the patient received appropriate analgesic management -ALL patients should receive an around-the-clock multimodal pain regimen that addresses both moderate to severe pain AND minimal or no pain dudsfragistics , along with strict monitoring of neurovascular status post-surgery.  After a period of immobilization (typically about 4-6 weeks), regular follow-up visits were scheduled to assess fracture healing progress through clinical examination, serial radiographs, and functional assessment -involving specific focus on wrist joint range of motion and grip strength restoration evaluation.  During these follow-up visits, occupational therapy sessions were initiated for hand strengthening exercises aiming at restoring functionality such as fine motor skills,dexterity ,and coordination in order for the patient could resume his daily activities properly .  Finally,in this case consultation referral is considered when increasing signs regarding professional intervention needs are perceived like but not limited to;deviation from normal time frame for bone consolidation decently estimation,failure in regaining desirable good functional outcome despite committed adequate rehabilitation program applications or prolonged persistence symptoms Complaining bony segment pains,fingers swelling ).

"Clinical Case: A 65-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease stage 3A presented to the oral medicine and oral surgery department at ST. JOHN'S Hospital (London, United Kingdom). He complained of persistent pain and discomfort in the left mandibular region.   The patient's medical history revealed that he had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago. He was managing his diabetes through insulin therapy with regular monitoring of his blood glucose levels. The patient also suffered from hypertension for which he took antihypertensive medications prescribed by his primary care physician. Additionally, he had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  Recently, the patient underwent dental treatment for a tooth decay issue during which he experienced acute pain in the left lower jaw area. Despite receiving root canal treatment on tooth number 37 at a local dental clinic three months ago, his symptoms persisted.  During examination, extraoral findings were unremarkable except for slight swelling around the left submandibular lymph node area measuring approximately one centimeter in diameter. The lymph node exhibited firm consistency upon palpation.  Intraorally, inspection revealed inadequate oral hygiene and a localized lesion on the buccal gingiva adjacent to tooth number 36 characterized by inflamed margins and ulcerated areas that appeared raised above the surrounding tissue level. The lesion measured approximately one centimeter in width and exhibited moderate gingival bleeding upon gentle probing.  Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of localized periodontitis or an inflammatory gum-related pathology was made. However given his medical history including chronic kidney disease stage 3A (with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min/1.73m²), further investigations were necessary to ensure appropriate management.  After obtaining informed consent from the patient regarding additional investigations, a comprehensive blood workup was conducted including routine hematological and biochemical parameters. These tests revealed uncontrolled diabetes with an HbA1c level of 8.5%, indicating poor glycemic control. Additionally, mild uremia was observed with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, consistent with his chronic kidney disease stage.  To assist in the establishment of a definitive diagnosis, radiographic assessment in the form of panoramic radiography and periapical X-rays was carried out. The images demonstrated evidence of significant bone loss around tooth number 36, extending to the distal root surface and affecting approximately two-thirds of the root length.  Considering all clinical and investigative data, a final diagnosis of advanced chronic periodontitis involving tooth number 36 was made in this patient with multiple comorbidities. The treatment plan encompassed initiating intensive oral hygiene instructions along with antimicrobial therapy consisting of locally-administered chlorhexidine mouthwash to reduce bacterial load within the oral cavity.  In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of excellent glycemic control particularly in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus along with multiple systemic conditions when managing oral health-related issues such as localized periodontitis. Effective interprofessional collaboration between dental healthcare professionals and general physicians is crucial for delivering optimal care to patients presenting with complex medical backgrounds like this imaginary patient scenario during routine dental visits.

"Clinical Case: A 60-Year-Old Woman with Progressive Lower Limb Weakness and Asymmetrical Abdominal Enlargement  Introduction: Mrs. Smith, a 60-year-old woman, presented to the clinic with complaints of progressive lower limb weakness and asymmetrical abdominal enlargement. Her symptoms started insidiously over the past year and had worsened gradually. This case aims to explore her clinical history, physical examination findings, and relevant investigations leading to a diagnosis.  History: Mrs. Smith reported an initial symptom of generalized weight gain which eventually resulted in truncal weight excess, especially on the right side of her abdomen. She denied any intra-abdominal pain but mentioned experiencing occasional waist pain in that area.  Functional Deficits: Over time, Mrs. Smith developed difficulty lying prone or supine due to abdominal discomfort and shortness of breath when lying flat. These difficulties impacted her activities of daily living as she could no longer drive without difficulty or walk for long durations without needing assistance from a walking stick.  Musculoskeletal Complaints: Bilateral knee pains were prominent complaints during this period for Mrs. Smith's mobility issues limiting her ability to ambulate effectively, ultimately resulting in dependence on support devices like a walking stick for stability.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination, it was noted that Mrs. Smith had significant asymmetrical abdominal enlargement, predominantly affecting the right side more than the left side. Further examination revealed tenderness on palpation over the enlarged right abdomen as opposed to the left half being relatively non-tender. Additionally concerning was bilateral weakness localized specifically in both lower limbs upon neurological examination while upper limb strength remained intact. Muscle tone appeared normal throughout but deep tendon reflexes exhibited decreased responses bilaterally; most notably reduced knee jerk reflexes. Sensory functions were intact both proprioception and dermal sensations throughout all limbs tested. There were no signs or symptoms suggestive of cranial nerve involvement or cerebellar dysfunction.  Diagnostic Investigations: In order to further evaluate the patient's condition, several diagnostic investigations were ordered. Initial laboratory studies such as complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and lipid profile resulted within normal limits. Further imaging of the abdomen via ultrasound revealed a significantly enlarged liver on the right side compared to the left with a diffuse pattern suggesting hepatomegaly. An electromyogram (EMG) was performed which demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes bilaterally in lower limbs without any evidence of peripheral neuropathy. To gain better insight into possible neuromuscular disorders or spinal pathologies contributing to her symptoms, an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was also performed.  Diagnosis: Based on Mrs. Smith's clinical presentation and investigative findings, she was diagnosed with Paraneoplastic Pseudo-Pseudohypoparathyroidism. It is a rare endocrine disorder involving parathyroid hormone resistance due to an underlying malignancy that can result in asymmetric abdominal enlargement along with musculoskeletal manifestations such as muscle weakness and pain.  Discussion: Paraneoplastic manifestations occur secondary to an undiagnosed malignancy that elicits autoimmune responses leading to abnormal hormone secretion and associated symptoms. In Mrs. Smith's case, it is suspected that her asymmetrical abdominal enlargement might be attributed to an underlying neoplasm inducing parathyroid hormone resistance resulting in weight gain predominantly localized on one side.  Treatment Plan: Mrs. Smith's management would involve consultation with various specialists including endocrinologists for further evaluation of paraneoplastic syndrome followed by definitive management of the associated malignancy if detected. Furthermore, physiotherapy and pain management measures would be initiated targeting her musculoskeletal symptoms and helping improve functional mobility.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights an important differential diagnosis for patients presenting with progressive lower limb weakness alongside asymmetrical abdominal enlargement. Paraneoplastic syndrome should be considered in such cases and necessitates a thorough evaluation to identify any underlying malignancies and manage associated symptoms effectively.",create
"A 34-year-old female, a librarian by occupation with left-hand dominance, presented to the emergency department after sustaining a fall at her workplace. The patient reported slipping on a wet surface and landing forcefully on her outstretched left hand. Despite feeling immediate pain in the left upper extremity, she denied any history of head trauma and remained conscious and oriented throughout the incident.  Following the accident, the patient was promptly transported to Mercy General Hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was triaged and assessed by an orthopedic surgeon who noted tenderness and swelling around her left wrist. Sensation was intact in all affected fingers without any signs of distal neurovascular compromise.  Based on clinical examination findings, the orthopedic surgeon ordered several investigations to further evaluate the extent of injury. X-ray imaging was performed to rule out any fractures or dislocations within the wrist joint. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were requested to provide more detailed information about soft tissue structures surrounding the injured area. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were also advised to assess nerve function accurately.  Following interpretation of these investigations, it was determined that our patient had suffered from an extensive radial nerve injury consistent with axonotmesis (Grade 3 Sunderland's classification). Fortunately, there were no accompanying fractures or bone involvement identified.  To ensure adequate stabilization of both her wrist and hand during healing, our patient received a static cock-up splint designed specifically for immobilization purposes. This splint would not only prevent further damage but also facilitate optimal healing conditions for damaged nerves in her radial distribution.  Given her persistent pain following this traumatic event, analgesic medications were prescribed accordingly to manage discomfort effectively while promoting restorative sleep patterns for enhanced recovery.  The orthopedic surgeon discussed comprehensive rehabilitation strategies with our patient before discharge from Mercy General Hospital: basic exercises for range-of-motion preservation as well as strengthening programs targeting proximal muscles in the upper extremity were prescribed. The importance of maintaining follow-up appointments at the orthopedic outpatient clinic after a period of 15 days was stressed to monitor progress, ensure adequate pain management, and assess healing response.  Our imaginary patient fully understood and acknowledged these instructions in their entirety before being discharged home. Appropriate analgesic prescriptions were provided alongside detailed information regarding potential side effects to watch for. The patient was also educated about red flag symptoms indicating a need to seek urgent medical attention.  In conclusion, our imaginary female patient suffered an unfortunate fall resulting in significant left wrist trauma and subsequent radial nerve injury without coinciding fractures or dislocations. Treatment included immobilization with a static cock-up splint for enhanced recovery conditions followed by comprehensive rehabilitation regimens tailored toward optimal functional outcomes. Close monitoring during follow-up appointments aimed at consistent assessment and appropriate intervention if necessary will be vital for our patient's successful recuperation. During her 15-day follow-up appointment at the orthopedic outpatient clinic, our patient reported a reduction in pain intensity and improved function compared to her initial presentation. The swelling around her left wrist had significantly diminished, and there were no signs of neurovascular compromise.  Physical examination revealed mild tenderness upon palpation in the affected area, but range of motion was notably improved. Sensation remained intact in all fingers along the radial nerve distribution, indicating positive recovery progress.  The orthopedic surgeon decided to continue with conservative management for our patient's radial nerve injury. She was advised to gradually wean off the static cock-up splint over the next few weeks while engaging in gentle stretching exercises as per guidance from a physical therapist.  To further aid in pain management and promote healing, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were added to her medication regimen. These medications would help reduce inflammation around the injured site and alleviate any residual pain or discomfort she might experience during her recovery process.  Recognizing that optimal healing required a multidisciplinary approach, our patient was referred for occupational therapy sessions focused on fine motor skills rehabilitation. These sessions aimed to improve dexterity and facilitate a return to functional activities such as writing or manipulating objects with precision using her left hand.  During subsequent follow-up appointments scheduled at monthly intervals, physical examination findings continued demonstrating improvement. Our patient reported diminishing symptoms of discomfort while displaying increased strength and functionality within her left wrist and hand. The orthopedic surgeon emphasized consistency with home exercises while gradually incorporating more challenging tasks under appropriate supervision.  At three months post-injury, our patient exhibited near-complete resolution of symptoms associated with radial nerve injury. Physical examination results indicated restoration of full range of motion without any remaining sensory deficits or weakness along the radial distribution pathways.  Given this positive outcome, the orthopedic surgeon deemed it unnecessary for further clinical visits related specifically to this injury unless future issues arose concerning persistent pain or functional limitations that might impede the patient's daily activities.  Our patient expressed profound gratitude for the exceptional care received throughout her journey to recovery. Her rehabilitation process had been challenging at times, but constant support and guidance from healthcare professionals enabled her to regain normalcy in her everyday life.  In conclusion, our imaginary female patient successfully achieved significant improvement and complete resolution of symptoms following conservative management for a radial nerve injury sustained during a fall. A comprehensive approach involving appropriate immobilization, pharmacological intervention, physical therapy exercises, and occupational therapy facilitated optimal healing and functional restoration. The collaborative efforts of healthcare providers allowed our patient to resume her regular activities without lasting impairments or limitations attributable to the initially sustained injury.",create
"The index patient is a 35-year-old female who presented with complaints of gradually worsening headache and unilateral vision loss over the past four weeks. The onset of symptoms was insidious, starting with intermittent headaches that progressively increased in intensity. The patient noticed a gradual decline in her visual acuity in her left eye, which eventually led to complete blindness on the same side.  There were no associated symptoms such as fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, leg swelling, shortness of breath, skin rash, blood in urine or pain during urination. The patient denied experiencing facial swelling or convulsions as well. Furthermore, she reported no history of jaundice or yellowing of the eyes.  Additionally, there were no complaints related to abdominal swelling or any significant changes in appetite resulting in unintentional weight loss. Likewise, there were no reports of night sweats that would suggest an underlying infectious etiology. Joint pain had not been experienced by the patient either.  Upon further investigation during the clinical examination by a neurologist specializing in optic disorders and ophthalmology consultation services collectively indicated potential impairments suggestive of optic neuritis affecting mainly one eye and possibly extending beyond it based on growing suspicions surrounding cortical involvement.  The patient disclosed other symptoms including mild fatigue and occasional dizziness; however these weren't primary concerns given their infrequent occurrence and relatively mild nature compared to her ongoing vision problems. She denied any ongoing nausea or vomiting that might suggest intracranial hypertension contributing to her initial headaches besides slurred speech for up two days not progressive until aphasia but partial sentence repetition was compromised already making verbal communication challenging sometimes exacerbated by episodic muscle weakness predominantly appearing on her left arm followed by both lower limbs later inhibiting mobility subsequently preventing standing still without assistance rendering walking independently unfeasible within a few weeks time frame.  Based on these findings with particular emphasis upon neurological deterioration ongoing since admission progressive following an irregular pattern approximating functional limitations arising from multifocal impairment, the clinical team determined that further investigations would be necessary to establish an accurate diagnosis.  Laboratory investigations including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urine analysis yielded results within normal limits. Lumbar puncture was performed to assess the cerebrospinal fluid for signs of inflammation or underlying infectious processes. The obtained sample revealed elevated protein levels consistent with central nervous system involvement. Further testing of the cerebrospinal fluid for specific infection markers such as antibodies related to viral causes and PCR studies produced negative results.  In view of these findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine were planned given growing concerns pertaining possible demyelinating disorders or more grave neurodegenerative etiologies resembling primary ischemic processes or autoimmune conditions because similar phenotypes overlap albeit variations persist in clinical course nature timing prognostic factors requiring continuous validation iterative classification among differential diagnoses currently expanding with each new case reported literature allows convergence towards promising therapeutic strategies expected significantly improve management patients otherwise presenting disabling unexplained neurological deficits affecting quality life socioeconomic status impacted undiagnosed illness thus delaying appropriate treatments increasingly recognized public health problem demanding expanded research initiatives join efforts internationally converge towards better understanding pathophysiology novel treatment objectives eradicate misdiagnosis despite compatibility initial presentation mentioned cases challenges persist defining critical window successful intervention utmost importance whoever we fall article reminding medical community remain alert consider alternative explanations even initial preponderance evidence points certain direction diagnostic methods available constantly evolving prognosis invariably varies case-by-case basis depending characteristic manifestations response therapeutic interventions",create
"We present the case of a 35-year-old woman, never-smoker, who presented with a two-month history of productive cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, and declining overall health. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral alveolar opacities consistent with infiltrates. Upon admission to the hospital, blood gases analysis in room air showed a partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 61 mmHg, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 39 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels within normal limits.  The patient's symptoms had worsened significantly in the past week leading to her referral to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). On examination, she appeared fatigued and had visibly increased work of breathing. Auscultation revealed widespread bilateral coarse crackles throughout lung fields. Her vital signs at presentation were stable with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute and blood pressure within normal range.  Further questioning elicited no history suggestive of environmental exposures or recent infections. She denied any fever or night sweats but reported unintentional weight loss over the past few months. Moreover, she acknowledged experiencing joint pain and occasional rashes on her arms and face but did not seek medical attention for these non-specific complaints.  Given her deteriorating respiratory status necessitating supplemental oxygen therapy at a high flow rate upon ICU admission, a provisional diagnosis of acute respiratory failure was made based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings.  Additional investigations were performed including laboratory workup which revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) indicative of ongoing inflammation. Rheumatoid factor was negative ruling out rheumatoid arthritis whereas antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titer came back positive at high titers suggesting an underlying autoimmune process.  She underwent additional imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan which demonstrated patchy ground-glass opacities involving multiple lung segments. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to obtain samples for further analysis. The cytological examination of the lavage fluid revealed a predominance of lymphocytes and increased levels of activated inflammatory cells.  Based on the patient's clinical presentation, radiographic findings, positive ANA titer, and lymphocytic alveolitis demonstrated on bronchoalveolar lavage, a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) was made. High-resolution CT scan detailed an extensive pattern consistent with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) rather than other ILD subtypes like usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or organizing pneumonia.  The patient was commenced on high-dose corticosteroids to mitigate inflammation and prevent further decline in pulmonary function. Close monitoring in the ICU allowed for adjustments in supplemental oxygen therapy as necessary. Pulmonary rehabilitation program initiation also aimed at addressing her exercise limitation associated with dyspnea and consequently improving overall quality of life.  In conclusion, we presented a case of a young woman with progressive dyspnea, bilateral alveolar opacities on imaging studies, and evidence of alveolitis suggestive of an underlying NSIP pattern consistent with interstitial lung disease. Employing prompt diagnostic investigations led to appropriate management interventions including corticosteroid therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation measures targeted at preserving lung function in this challenging clinical scenario. During her hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved with corticosteroid therapy. Follow-up chest X-rays showed a progressive resolution of the previously observed alveolar opacities, indicating a positive response to treatment. The blood gases analysis also demonstrated a significant improvement in arterial oxygen levels.  As part of the comprehensive management plan, the patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team consisting of pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and respiratory therapists. They collaborated to assess her long-term prognosis and develop an individualized care strategy.  Subsequent pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive lung disease with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity (TLC), consistent with interstitial lung disease involvement. The diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was significantly impaired.  Given the positive ANA titer and persistent joint pain, further autoimmune workup was conducted to explore potential underlying connective tissue disorders contributing to ILD. Additional serological evaluations were performed including anti-Jo-1 antibodies, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, and anti-Sjögren syndrome-related antigen A/B (anti-SSA/SSB) antibodies - however all results came back negative ruling out specific rheumatologic conditions frequently associated with ILD.  Based on these findings in conjunction with clinical judgment by the multidisciplinary team, it was concluded that this patient had idiopathic NSIP as an isolated manifestation rather than secondary to a recognized systemic autoimmune process.  The patient received ongoing close follow-up after her discharge from ICU - regular clinic appointments allowed for monitoring of symptom progression or occurrence of any adverse effects related to long-term corticosteroid therapy such as osteoporosis or increased infection risk.  To address her joint pain complaints which persisted after initiation of corticosteroid treatment for NSIP alone, cautious introduction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) under close rheumatology supervision was implemented, resulting in improved quality of life and pain control.  The patient demonstrated significant improvement in her functional status over subsequent months. Pulmonary rehabilitation proved invaluable in helping her regain pulmonary endurance and manage dyspnea more effectively during physical activities. In addition, routine chest X-rays were performed to monitor disease progression on an outpatient basis.  Although the long-term prognosis for NSIP can vary, early diagnosis and intervention with corticosteroids have been associated with better outcomes. Regular follow-ups, timely adjustments of therapy based on clinical response, and supportive care measures remained important components in managing this patient's condition effectively.  In conclusion, we presented a detailed case of a young woman diagnosed with idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) manifesting as bilateral alveolar opacities and progressive dyspnea. Through prompt recognition of the disease process and initiation of appropriate treatment modalities including high-dose corticosteroids followed by pulmonary rehabilitation techniques, this patient experienced favorable outcomes with noticeable symptom improvement and lung function optimization throughout her journey towards recovery.",create
"Clinical Case: A 30-year-old woman with Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy  Introduction: A 30-year-old woman, with no remarkable medical history and gravida two para one (G2P1), presented to the gynecological emergency unit of our university hospital with complaints of neurosensory symptoms. She reported experiencing a persistent pounding headache and intermittent episodes of blurred vision for the past four days. Moreover, she noticed her blood pressure was significantly elevated, accompanied by swelling in her lower extremities. At the time of presentation, she estimated herself to be approximately 32 weeks pregnant.  Patient Presentation: The patient appeared alert and oriented upon examination, exhibiting no signs of altered consciousness or confusion. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded as 15 out of 15, indicating no impairment in neurological function. Musculoskeletal assessment revealed normal osteo-tendinous reflexes along with intact plantar reflexes. No motor deficits or sensory abnormalities were detected during our initial evaluation.  Medical History: The patient denied any prior history or medical conditions such as hypertension, autoimmune disorders, thromboembolism, or chronic liver disease that might have contributed to her current symptoms. Her previous pregnancy did not involve any complications related to high blood pressure or neurological disturbances.  Physical Examination: During physical examination, the patient's vital signs were recorded as follows: blood pressure at admission was measured at an alarmingly high level (systolic/diastolic = 170/110 mmHg), whereas heart rate remained within normal limits at 80 beats per minute. Notably, peripheral edema was observed in both lower extremities but was absent in other regions assessed.  Further Investigation Further Investigation: Given the patient's clinical presentation, additional investigations were initiated to evaluate her condition. Laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function tests, and coagulation profile. Initial findings revealed no significant abnormalities in these parameters.  To assess the extent of organ involvement and establish a baseline for ongoing monitoring, renal function tests were ordered. The results indicated mild proteinuria with an elevated urine protein/creatinine ratio. Additionally, a 24-hour urine collection was recommended to accurately quantify protein excretion.  Imaging studies such as an obstetric ultrasound and Doppler assessment of uteroplacental blood flow were performed to evaluate fetal wellbeing and placental function. These investigations aimed to rule out conditions like placental abruption or uteroplacental insufficiency that might contribute to hypertension-associated complications.  Diagnostic Hypothesis: Based on the patient's symptoms of persistent headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure readings, lower extremity edema (without generalized edema), and mild proteinuria on laboratory analysis - coupled with her gestational age - our provisional diagnosis was Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP). Specifically, we suspected the presence of preeclampsia or its severe form called eclampsia given the neurological symptoms she presented with.  Management: The patient was admitted immediately for further management in consultation with the obstetrics team. Given her elevated blood pressure readings in combination with neurological manifestations, it was imperative to control her hypertension promptly to prevent potential complications such as seizures or stroke.  Antihypertensive therapy with medications safe for pregnancy – such as labetalol or methyldopa – was initiated cautiously under strict maternal-fetal monitoring protocols guided by experienced obstetricians. In addition, daily fetal movement counting along with regular Doppler assessments ensured timely detection of any signs that might necessitate expedited delivery if fetal well-being were to be compromised.  The patient was counseled about the importance of strict bed rest, monitoring blood pressure at home, and attending regular antenatal follow-up appointments for close supervision of her condition. Close surveillance of maternal and fetal parameters including frequent blood pressure checks, urine protein quantification, and serial ultrasounds provided essential data for ongoing evaluation.  Follow-Up: The prognosis of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy highly depends on successful control of hypertension and timely intervention if complications arise. Frequent communication between the obstetric team, nursing staff, and other relevant healthcare professionals ensured efficient implementation of the management plan. The patient's response to treatment was monitored closely through regular assessments with a multi-disciplinary approach.  Conclusion: This clinical case highlights a 30-year-old pregnant woman presenting with symptoms suggestive of Hypertensive Disorders or Pregnancy (HDP), specifically preeclampsia or eclampsia. Early recognition and prompt initiation of antihypertensive therapy are essential for managing these potentially serious conditions while optimizing fetal outcomes. Patient education about maintaining good prenatal care practices is crucial to prevent future complications associated with HDP. Close follow-up is necessary to ensure effective management throughout pregnancy until delivery under careful observation by a team skilled in handling high-risk pregnancies in order to achieve optimal maternal-fetal outcomes.",create
"Title: ""A Case of Neonatal Respiratory Distress with Suspected Materno-Fetal Infection""  Patient Summary: We present a case of a male neonate, born at approximately 35 weeks' gestation to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past medical history. The patient was delivered vaginally and had normal extra-uterine adaptation. However, meconium-stained amniotic fluid was observed during birth. The baby's birth weight measured 3030g, which aligned with the 75th percentile for his gestational age. Although his physical examination at birth appeared normal, he experienced transient respiratory distress. Following suspicion of materno-fetal infection, the neonate was admitted to a private clinic for four days and received antibiotics for 48 hours.  Case Presentation: Medical History:  Our patient is a male neonate born to healthy parents in their early twenties. There is no significant past medical history reported by either parent; however, consanguinity (third degree) exists within the family.  Perinatal History: The mother received standard prenatal care during her pregnancy and had no complications besides progressing slightly beyond term. Throughout her pregnancy, she denied any exposure to known teratogens or infections.  Delivery Details: The delivery took place via normal vaginal route after reaching near full term (35 weeks' gestation). Fetal heart monitoring revealed meconium-stained amniotic fluid indicating fetal distress necessitating close monitoring during labor and immediate postnatal care.  Initial Assessment: On initial assessment following delivery, our patient displayed transient respiratory distress characterized by tachypnea and mild intercostal retractions but lacked central cyanosis or grunting respiration suggestive of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Oxygen supplementation via hood device administered initially showed positive response within minutes as his oxygen saturation improved from 85% to sustained levels above 95%. A chest X-ray did not demonstrate overt abnormalities concerning for lung pathology.  Hospitalization and Materno-Fetal Infection Suspicion: In light of the suspicion of materno-fetal infection due to potential exposure to meconium-stained amniotic fluid, the neonate was transferred to a private clinic for further evaluation and treatment. He received empirical antibiotic therapy including intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin due to his increased risk profile. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were obtained prior to initiating antibiotics.  Clinical Course: During his four-day hospitalization, our patient remained hemodynamically stable with normalization of respiratory rate within 24 hours. Serial laboratory investigations showed no evidence of systemic inflammation or abnormal blood gas analysis results. The blood culture results returned negative after 48 hours.  Discharge Planning: Given the absence of active signs or symptoms suggestive of materno-fetal infection combined with favorable lab outcomes, it was deemed appropriate to discontinue antibiotics after 48 hours and discharge our patient home in stable condition. The parents were counseled on common newborn care practices such as breastfeeding techniques, routine follow-up appointments for weight checks and vaccinations, recognition of danger signs requiring medical attention (e.g., poor feeding intolerance or worsening respiratory distress), as well as guidance on proper hygiene practices during this pandemic era.  Follow-up Care: A community nurse will visit the family within three days following discharge to assess the infant's general health status including growth parameters (weight gain), perform necessary blood screenings if indicated by clinical judgment (such as repeat C-reactive protein levels), provide additional guidance regarding breastfeeding techniques if needed, answer any questions from parents regarding neonatal care practices while promoting maternal bonding with her baby through emotional support provided via counseling skills during visits.  Conclusion: We have described a case of neonatal respiratory distress following a normal vaginal delivery complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid exposure. Given suspicion for materno-fetal infection based on these findings, the patient was admitted to a private clinic where antibiotics were administered for 48 hours. The neonate's clinical course was favorable with subsequent discharge home in stable condition and planned follow-up care to ensure optimal growth and development.",create
"A 6-year-old girl was brought to the emergency department by her parents due to complaints of persistent headache, vomiting, and unsteady gait. Medical history revealed that she had been previously diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 4 years. At that time, she underwent a craniotomy for resection and subsequent radiation therapy for treatment. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of medulloblastoma, a highly malignant tumor originating in primitive neuroectodermal cells.  Upon physical examination, the child appeared pale and lethargic. Her vital signs were within normal limits except for an elevated body temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Neurological examination revealed bilateral papilledema, indicating increased intracranial pressure secondary to hydrocephalus.  Diagnostic imaging was performed in order to assess the extent of disease recurrence or progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated obstructive hydrocephalus with dilated lateral ventricles and a centrally located mass measuring approximately 5 × 3 cm in size within the posterior fossa.  In light of these findings, surgical intervention was deemed necessary to alleviate symptoms and establish appropriate CSF drainage. The patient underwent placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) initially as a temporizing measure until further management decisions could be made.  Neurosurgical consultation suggested consideration for ventriculoperitoneal shunting as it would provide long-term CSF diversion into the peritoneal cavity once acute symptoms resolved. However, due to unforeseen complications including severe peritonitis from previous abdominal surgery related adhesions noted during exploratory laparoscopy; ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunting via percutaneous insertion through her subclavian vein seemed more suitable under these circumstances.  The patient subsequently underwent VA shunt placement under general anesthesia in collaboration with interventional radiology specialists who provided fluoroscopic guidance throughout the procedure. The tip of the catheter was positioned within the right atrium to allow effective CSF drainage.  Close monitoring was initiated postoperatively. The child's vital signs remained stable, and she showed gradual improvement in her level of consciousness and reduction in headache intensity. Serial neurological examinations indicated a steady regression of papilledema, further confirming successful resolution of hydrocephalus.  Further management plans involved immediate collaboration with the oncology team for a comprehensive oncological workup including cerebrospinal fluid cytology, tumor markers, and whole-body imaging to assess the extent of tumor recurrence or metastasis.  In addition to sharp surgical resection being initially attempted during disease diagnosis, further treatment options such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy were thoroughly discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting involving neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, pediatricians, and radiation oncologists. Based on these discussions and taking into consideration various risk factors such as age at presentation, pathology results indicating high-grade medulloblastoma along with adequate performance status; adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with whole-brain radiation therapy emerged as the preferred option for this patient's current clinical scenario.  The patient underwent multiple cycles of aggressive chemotherapy alongside craniospinal irradiation aiming at maximal tumor elimination while minimizing adverse effects associated with treatment. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor clinical response to therapy while managing side effects comprehensively.  Although aiming for optimal disease control remains crucial in this challenging case, supportive care interventions addressing pain management and psychological support remain paramount aspects within this patient's ongoing care plan in order to maintain an optimal quality-of-life despite her complex medical condition.

"Observation 1: Mr. J.S. Caribbean, 42 years (in 2021) with past medical history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in July 11th, 2015, appendectomy in January 2019, and a motor vehicle accident resulting in a fractured tibia and fibula in May 2020. He has been admitted to the hospital from August 15th to August 22nd for an acute-onset progressive muscle weakness of both lower limbs since mid-July.  Mr. J.S., a previously healthy and active individual, first noticed a mild weakness in his lower limbs while climbing stairs approximately six weeks ago. Initially, he attributed it to fatigue or overexertion from his physically demanding job as a construction worker. However, the weakness gradually progressed despite rest and resulted in significant difficulties with walking and performing routine activities of daily living.  Upon admission to the hospital on August 15th this year, clinical examination demonstrated symmetrical paresis affecting both lower limbs equally with reduced muscle strength rated at 2/5 proximally and mildly improved at about 3/5 distally. On evaluation for neurological signs specifically related to motor function deficits,  Mr. J.S.'s case revealed several key findings consistent with his symptoms:  1) Positive Tabouret's sign: A physical examination technique that involves observing the patient's ability or inability to rise from sitting on a chair using only their leg muscles without assistance showed difficulty rising due to reduced lower limb muscle strength.  2) Absent knee jerk reflexes: Normally elicited by tapping the patellar tendon below the kneecap using a reflex hammer during physical examination; Mr.J.S.did not exhibit this response bilaterally.  3) Absent ankle jerk reflexes: Similar method employed as above but eliciting reactions via Achilles tendon tapping instead caused no observable reaction bilateral  4) Lack of idiomuscular response: Muscle reflexes in the deltoid and psoas muscles were absent, suggesting a generalized neuromuscular disorder as a probable etiology.  To identify the underlying cause of Mr. J.S.'s symptoms, further investigations were performed during his hospitalization. These included blood tests to assess for electrolyte imbalances, liver and renal function, as well as metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism. Additionally, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) were conducted to evaluate peripheral nerve function. An MRI scan of the spine was also ordered to rule out any compressive lesions.  Laboratory results showed no significant abnormalities in serum electrolytes or thyroid function tests. Nerve conduction studies indicated a generalized peripheral neuropathy with reduced amplitude potentials observed in both lower limbs' motor nerves. The electromyography findings supported these findings by demonstrating denervation changes within several muscles examined bilaterally.  Further imaging investigations revealed no evidence of spinal cord compression or any other structural lesions along the neuraxis that could explain Mr.J.S.'s presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans excluded metastatic disease or spinal injuries resulting from his previous fracture.  Given his clinical symptoms and investigation results, a presumptive diagnosis emerged: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an acute-onset autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness that typically begins distally and ascends rapidly over a few weeks before reaching its peak intensity.  Based on this initial impression of GBS, Mr.J.S.was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy promptly to modulate the immune response targeting his peripheral nerves and promote their recovery process more effectively.  Mr.J.S.'s condition gradually improved during his hospital stay following immunoglobulin therapy administration; muscle strength slowly returned with proximal strength eventually rating 3/5 bilaterally while distal muscle strength improved remarkably to almost 4/5 after neurologists intervened by recommendation via physical therapy department's assistance.  Mr. J.S. was discharged home with plans for ongoing neurology outpatient follow-up, regular physiotherapy sessions to optimize his motor recovery, and counseling regarding potential long-term complications of GBS-like residual weakness or neuropathic pain.  In conclusion, Mr.J.S., a previously healthy 42-year-old construction worker from the Caribbean region, presented with an acute-onset progressive muscle weakness affecting both lower limbs symmetrically. Clinical examination and subsequent investigations were consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Early intervention through intravenous immunoglobulin therapy facilitated gradual improvement in muscle strength during his hospital stay. Subsequent outpatient management aimed at optimizing his functional recovery through rehabilitation and monitoring for potential long-term sequelae related to GBS's autoimmune nature.",create
"A 35-year-old construction worker presented to the dermatovenereology outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of an elevated reddish-brown plaque on his left forearm, along with scattered smaller lesions on both lower legs. The patient reported that the lesion on his forearm had been present for approximately 10 years before seeking medical attention. He initially noticed small, painless bumps that gradually enlarged and became rough in texture.  The patient stated that he had occasionally experienced itching in the affected areas but denied any associated pain. He mentioned that scratching or accidental trauma often resulted in bleeding from the larger lesion on his forearm and some of the smaller lesions on his legs. The bleeding was intermittent and mixed with a clear fluid resembling serum.  Upon further investigation, the patient revealed no history of chronic cough, bloody cough, night sweats or unintentional weight loss. He also denied any previous treatment for tuberculosis.  On physical examination, a single raised plaque was observed measuring approximately 5 cm x 4 cm on the patient's left forearm. The surface of this lesion appeared rough and hyperkeratotic, displaying patches of erythema. On palpation, it felt firm and adherent to underlying structures without signs of inflammation or tenderness.  Additionally, multiple smaller papules were found scattered over both lower legs but sparing other body regions including foot soles and palms. These papules varied in size between 0.5 cm to 1 cm and exhibited similar morphological features as seen in the larger forearm plaque - rough texture with surrounding patches of erythema.  No lymphadenopathy was noted during examination nor were there any signs suggestive of systemic involvement such as hepatomegaly or splenomegaly observed upon abdominal palpation.  Due to its chronicity and characteristic clinical presentation, a skin biopsy was performed from one of the smaller papules for histopathological analysis. Microscopic examination demonstrated hyperkeratosis with acanthosis and irregular elongation of the rete ridges. Additionally, there were numerous dilated blood vessels in the papillary dermis with extravasated erythrocytes and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.  Considering the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma was made. The patient was counseled regarding the association of Kaposi's sarcoma with immunocompromised states including HIV infection and other immunosuppressive states. He denied any constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss that might suggest underlying immunosuppression.  Further investigations were recommended to evaluate for immune dysfunction or any other potential risk factors that may have contributed to the development of this neoplasm.  In summary, a 35-year-old construction worker presented with a long-standing elevated reddish-brown plaque on his forearm along with scattered smaller lesions on both lower legs. The absence of pain but intermittent bleeding upon trauma or scratching raised suspicion for Kaposi's sarcoma. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, warranting further evaluation for underlying immune dysfunction or potential risk factors contributing to its development. Further investigations revealed that the 35-year-old construction worker tested negative for HIV infection, ruling out one of the most common risk factors for Kaposi's sarcoma. The patient's complete blood count demonstrated no significant abnormalities, with normal levels of lymphocytes and other immune cell subsets. Serologic tests for viral infections such as human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and hepatitis B and C were also negative.  Given the absence of any identifiable immunocompromised state or known risk factors, a more extensive search was initiated to evaluate other potential causes contributing to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in this patient. A detailed medical history was obtained to assess any exposure to environmental toxins or potential occupational hazards.  The patient reported a significant history of prolonged sun exposure due to his work in construction, often without adequate sun protection during long hours outdoors. This raised concern about chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure as an additional contributing factor in the pathogenesis of his Kaposi's sarcoma.  Further dermatological evaluation assessed his general skin condition and identified multiple actinic keratoses on chronically exposed areas such as face, forearms, and hands. These findings led to an increased suspicion that chronic solar injury might have played a role in the development of atypical lesions observed on his forearm and legs.  In light of this new information, a revised diagnosis was made attributing both local trauma-induced bleeding as well as underlying solar damage leading to the formation of keratoacanthoma-like lesions rather than classical Kaposi's sarcoma.  Treatment options were discussed with the patient considering both histopathological findings confirming benign nature yet persistent occurrence and intermittent bleeding from these expandable plaques.Perhaps surgical excision would be required along with appropriate photoprotection measures like avoiding excessive sunlight exposure or using broad-spectrum sunscreen regularly.  Additionally, education around skin self-examination techniques was provided so that any future atypical lesions could be reported promptly, and the patient's sun protection practices were reinforced to minimize further solar injury.  Follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the evolution of these lesions, particularly in terms of size, texture, and propensity for bleeding. The patient was advised to observe any changes in his skin or any new lesions that might arise over time. Emphasizing the importance of early reporting any suspicious findings for timely diagnosis and intervention was stressed during counseling sessions.  Throughout this medical journey, an interdisciplinary approach involving dermatovenereologists, oncologists, and surgical specialists was embraced to ensure comprehensive management of this distinct case. The ongoing collaboration between different healthcare professionals aimed at optimizing patient care by tailoring treatment options based on evolving diagnostic findings while incorporating the patient's preferences and concerns into decision-making processes.  In conclusion, a 35-year-old construction worker presented with plaques and papules raising concern for Kaposi's sarcoma; however further evaluation revealed chronic solar injury as a more plausible cause given history of extensive sun exposure without protection. This highlights the importance of thorough investigation in clinical practice to establish an accurate diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment strategies.",create
"Case: A ten-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency room with sudden onset of pain and swelling in his left hand. The patient had recently received a tetanus toxoid vaccine injection on the same hand due to a minor cut that occurred during outdoor play. The pain in the left hand was severe, and the patient described it as throbbing and worsening over time. Along with the pain, he noticed that his fingers were becoming colder and there was a bluish discoloration of his hand.  The patient's mother reported that there were no fevers, recent trauma, history of sickle cell disease or bleeding tendencies in their family. The boy had been otherwise healthy with no significant medical history. Upon further examination, it was noted that he had limited ability to move his fingers due to the discomfort.  On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits except for slightly elevated heart rate due to pain response. On inspection of the left hand, there was swelling involving all five fingers along with cyanosis extending up to mid forearm level. The affected hand felt cooler when compared to the right one.  Peripheral pulses were palpable but weakly appreciated at radial and ulnar arteries of the affected limb when compared with those on the opposite side. Sensation testing revealed decreased sensation along with tingling on light touch over affected fingers compared to those unaffected.  Considering these clinical findings, a diagnosis of acute arterial ischemia secondary to vascular compromise was suspected.  The patient's tetanus toxoid vaccination site appeared normal without any signs or symptoms suggestive of infection or inflammation related specifically t o the injection. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. X-ray imaging of the left hand did not reveal any fractures or dislocations.  To further evaluate the arterial circulation in the affected limb, a Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing diminished blood flow in the radial and ulnar arteries. This finding supported the hypothesis of arterial compromise being responsible for the symptoms.  The patient was promptly referred to a vascular surgery specialist for further management. An urgent angiogram confirmed a left brachial artery occlusion at mid-arm level with no signs of emboli or thrombus formation elsewhere in his vasculature. Immediate intervention was deemed necessary to restore blood flow and prevent irreversible tissue damage.  Under general anesthesia, an embolectomy procedure was successfully performed by the vascular surgeon. Small fragments of cholesterol plaque were removed from within the affected artery to reestablish normal blood flow. Post-procedure Doppler ultrasound demonstrated restoration of good distal perfusion with improved pulse strength.  Postoperatively, pain relief was evident as reported by both patient and his mother. The bluish discoloration started fading gradually over time as oxygenated blood circulated more effectively into his hand. The patient's mobility improved significantly, allowing him to move his fingers without discomfort.  In subsequent days, regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor healing progress and ensure proper recovery from ischemic insult in his left hand.  Throughout this process, meticulous wound care along with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage aiming at minimizing infection risks were provided by nursing staff on pediatric surgical unit where he was admitted post-surgery.  Physical therapy interventions such as gentle range-of-motion exercises and strengthening activities were initiated once healing had progressed sufficiently to promote functional recovery while aiming at preventing joint stiffness or contractures that may hinder long-term functionality in his hand.  After four weeks under close surveillance by both surgical team experts and dedicated rehabilitation specialists within hospital premises until discharge planning and transitioning into an outpatient therapy program could be arranged.  The patient's clinical course remained uneventful, and a subsequent Doppler ultrasound showed patent radial and ulnar arteries with no evidence of recurrent occlusion. The boy continued to regain full function of his left hand without any residual pain or sensory deficits at follow-up visits over several months.  This case highlights the importance of considering arterial compromise in patients presenting with acute onset limb pain, swelling, and discoloration following recent medical interventions in the same limb. Early recognition and prompt referral to the appropriate specialist are crucial for achieving positive patient outcomes by minimizing tissue damage and maximizing functional recovery.",create
"History: A 29-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1 at an estimated gestational age of 10 weeks, presented to our hospital with concerns regarding her current pregnancy. She had been experiencing intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past two weeks. The pain was mild to moderate in intensity and occasionally radiated towards her back. Additionally, she noticed a scant amount of vaginal bleeding which started yesterday.   This patient had one previous full-term vaginal delivery without any complications and was currently taking prenatal vitamins regularly. She reported normal fetal movements and denied any recent trauma or infection.  Upon experiencing these symptoms, the patient sought medical advice and consulted with her primary care provider who ordered a pelvic ultrasound scan (USS) for further evaluation.  Physical examination revealed a well-oriented young woman in no apparent distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits, including blood pressure of 118/74 mmHg and heart rate of 78 beats per minute.  Abdominal examination showed no visible signs of bruising or lesions. Mild tenderness was elicited upon palpation above the symphysis pubis without rebound or guarding being noted.  Upon speculum examination, there was evidence of pinkish vaginal discharge but no active bleeding observed during the assessment. The cervix appeared unchanged in consistency and closed on visualization.  Laboratory investigations were conducted, including complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, blood type determination, Rh factor screening as well as coagulation profile tests to rule out potential underlying causes for these symptoms.  The CBC results revealed hemoglobin levels within the normal range (14g/dL) indicating an absence of significant volume loss due to bleeding or anemia associated with it. Urine analysis showed no abnormalities such as urinary tract infections or high protein levels suggestive of kidney dysfunction.  The USS findings confirmed an intrauterine gestational sac with a live embryo measuring approximately ten weeks based on crown-rump length (CRL). The placenta was detected posteriorly, indicating a normal anatomical position. No evidence of ectopic pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic diseases was noted during the scan.  After careful evaluation of all investigative findings and considering the patient's clinical presentation, a diagnosis of threatened abortion was made. The suspected cause for her symptoms included mild placental separation or cervical changes, which may lead to vaginal spotting and lower abdominal discomfort.  The patient was counseled regarding this diagnosis and reassured that most cases of threatened abortion resolve spontaneously without causing harm to the pregnancy. However, she was also informed about potential complications such as increased bleeding, worsening pain, or complete miscarriage that would necessitate further medical intervention.  A follow-up plan was established to monitor her symptoms closely over the next week while providing her with necessary support both emotionally and physically. She was advised to report any worsening pain or heavy bleeding immediately for prompt assessment.  In conclusion, this young woman presented at ten weeks' gestation with mild lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding suggestive of a threatened abortion. Through a systematic approach involving history taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations including USS assessment, an appropriate diagnosis could be reached allowing for adequate counseling about the expected course and possible complications associated with her condition.",create
"Title: Clinical Case: A 35-year-old Male with Weight Loss and Pancytopenia  Patient Background: Mr. X, a 35-year-old male, presented with several weeks of worsening fatigue and unintentional weight loss. Prior to admission, he experienced asthenia along with a significant loss of appetite. His general condition gradually deteriorated in the past month, prompting medical evaluation.  Clinical Presentation: Upon examination, Mr. X appeared visibly malnourished and had lost considerable weight over the past few weeks. His body temperature was elevated, measuring at approximately 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination revealed no lymph node hypertrophy upon admission and there were no noticeable hepatosplenomegaly findings upon abdominal palpation.  Laboratory Investigations: Several abnormal laboratory findings were noted during Mr. X's initial workup:  - Hemoglobin levels demonstrated a microcytic anemia at 8.1 g/dl. - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicated microcytic erythrocytes at 78.5 fl. - Thrombocytopenia was observed with platelet count measuring as low as 9,000 G/l. - Leukopenia was identified with leukocyte counts dropping to 1,580 G/l. - Neutropenia reflected low neutrophil levels at 850 G/l. - Lymphopenia presented as reduced lymphocyte counts of only 500 G/l.  Discussion:  Case Analysis: The aforementioned clinical presentation suggests that Mr.X is presenting symptoms consistent with an underlying systemic illness or malignancy leading to pancytopenia - a reduction in all three essential blood components: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets.  Differential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation encompassed several possible etiologies that should be considered:  1) Hematological Disorders:    a) Aplastic anemia    b) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)    c) Bone marrow failure syndromes  2) Infectious Etiologies:    a) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)    b) Viral hepatitis    c) Tuberculosis  3) Connective Tissue Disorders:    a) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)     4) Malignancies:     a. Leukemias     b. Lymphomas      Further Investigations:  To establish the underlying cause of Mr. X's pancytopenia, additional investigations were initiated, including:  1. Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy: This procedure aims to evaluate the cellular composition of the bone marrow for evidence of infiltration or abnormal cell growth.  2. Blood Smear and Peripheral Blood Flow Cytometry: These tests help in identifying any presence of abnormal cells in circulation, such as blasts or atypical lymphocytes.  3. Serological Tests: To rule out infectious causes like HIV and hepatitis.  4. Autoimmune Screening: Including markers for autoimmune disorders such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA).  Treatment and Follow-up:  Pending further diagnostic workup, empirical management was initiated to address Mr.X's clinical symptoms while awaiting confirmed diagnosis and treatment plan based on the results.   The patient received supportive care including oral nutritional supplements to promote weight gain along with blood transfusions to manage symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia-induced bleeding risks.  Outcomes:  Given the serious nature of his clinical presentation, regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor his disease progression, manage complications arising from pancytopenia ,and alter management based on emerging information from ongoing diagnostic investigations.  Conclusion:  Mr.X presents with fatigue, weight loss, fever, and pancytopenia — reflective of potential severe hematological disorders, infections, connective tissue diseases, or malignancies. Given the varying etiologies and possible complications associated with these conditions, further investigations are warranted to establish an accurate diagnosis. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to aid in timely management and improve clinical outcomes for patients presenting with similar symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.",create
"Patient Information:   On the 15th November 2021, a previously healthy, 23-year-old Asian female was admitted to the emergency department at St. Mary's Hospital in Los Angeles. The patient was transferred from a local clinic with a one-week history of fever, generalized rash over the body and face, intermittent headache with associated neck pain, sore throat, and a dry cough. The symptoms were preceded by an episode of diarrhea.  Medical History:  The patient had no significant medical history and reported no previous hospitalizations or surgeries. She did not have any known allergies to medications or food. Her family medical history was unremarkable for any hereditary diseases.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient complained of persistent fatigue and malaise for approximately two weeks before seeking medical attention when she developed a high-grade fever that spiked up to 103°F (39.4°C). Over the course of one week, she experienced an erythematous rash that started on her trunk then spread to her limbs as well as her face and eyelids. The rash was non-blanching and slightly raised, resembling small red dots.  Alongside the fever and rash, she reported experiencing intermittent throbbing headaches accompanied by neck pain that worsened with movement or bending forward. Additionally, she complained of a persistent sore throat that caused discomfort while swallowing or speaking.  She noticed dryness in her mouth for several days leading up to admission along with an irritating dry cough that occasionally elicited bouts of chest tightness but didn't produce any sputum.  There were no reports of joint pain or swelling affecting multiple joints (arthralgias), oral ulcers inside her mouth, nasal ulcers present in the nasal cavity lining nor any unusual discharge from the urethra.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Upon admission to St Mary's Hospital Emergency Department on arrival from the local clinic; inquiries about exposure led to ruling out potential contact with infectious diseases like tuberculosis or COVID-19. Furthermore, travel history revealed no recent trips to endemic areas for any specific infections.  Investigations revealed leukopenia with a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9 cells/L (4-11 x 10^9 cells/L) and mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 130 x 10^9 cells/L (150-450 x 10^9 cells/L). Basic biochemistry panel, liver function tests, and renal function tests were within normal limits.  The patient underwent a throat swab for culture and sensitivity testing to rule out group A Streptococcus infection as the cause of her sore throat. Blood cultures were also obtained in order to identify any bacterial pathogens circulating in her bloodstream.  Current Treatment:  Upon admission, the patient was immediately started on empiric intravenous antibiotics consisting of broad-spectrum coverage until definitive identification of any infectious agents could be made.  She was prescribed supportive care including antipyretics for fever control and analgesics to alleviate headache and neck pain symptoms. Additionally, she received topical corticosteroids and emollients for symptomatic relief of skin manifestations caused by the rash.  Outcome:  The patient's condition stabilized within the first few days following initiation of treatment. She reported gradual improvement in overall fatigue levels as well as diminishing frequency and severity of headaches. The rash began subsiding around day three; complete resolution occurred after approximately two weeks without further intervention required.  The results from microbiological investigations started becoming available around day seven but no identifiable pathogens were isolated from either blood or throat cultures at that point, thus ruling out bacterial etiology for her symptoms.  Follow-up appointments were scheduled with an infectious diseases specialist along with serial laboratory assessments aiming to monitor immune markers like complement levels among others that might help elucidate potential underlying causes contributing to this clinical presentation",create
"Title: A 45-year-old Woman with Fever, Headache, and Abdominal Pain: A Probable Zoonotic Infection?  Case Presentation:  A 45-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department of a rural hospital in Eastern India complaining of acute onset high-grade intermittent fever, associated with chills and rigors for the past four days. Alongside the fever, she experienced severe headache, myalgia, diffuse abdominal pain, and recurrent episodes of vomiting. There were no complaints of diarrhea or yellowness of the eyes. The patient had previously tried self-medication with over-the-counter antipyretics without any discernible improvement.  The patient worked as an animal husbandry technician in a veterinary research institute where she was routinely exposed to different animals including livestock. Due to her job nature, she often spent considerable time outdoors in various animal enclosures.  Medical History:  Apart from well-controlled hypertension and occasional headaches related to stress at work, there were no significant medical conditions reported by the patient. She denied any recent travel history or exposure to sick contacts.  Physical Examination Findings:  On examination at admission, the patient appeared ill but conscious. Her temperature was 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure recorded at 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 98 beats per minute (regular), respiratory rate normal at 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation maintained at 98% on room air. General physical examination revealed mild conjunctival injection but absence of icterus.  The cardiovascular examination showed regular heart sounds without murmurs or added sounds while lungs were clear bilaterally on auscultation. The abdomen was soft but tender diffusely upon palpation without any obvious guarding or organomegaly detected during initial assessment.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Laboratory investigations performed soon after admission showed evidence of mild leukocytosis (12 ×10^9/L; reference range: 4-11 ×10^9/L) with neutrophilic predominance. The hematocrit level was within normal limits (38%; reference range: 36-46%). Blood chemistry results demonstrated normal liver and kidney function tests, while the electrolyte panel was unremarkable.  Considering the occupational exposure and clinical presentation, a number of infectious etiologies were considered as potential diagnoses. Initial investigations included a rapid malaria antigen test, which turned out negative. Screening for dengue virus using NS1 antigen assay and IgM serology was also negative.  Management:  Given the absence of an obvious diagnosis based on preliminary tests and considering the patient's substantial animal contact at work, additional investigations were deemed necessary to evaluate possible zoonotic infections. As a precautionary measure, empirical antibiotics were initiated pending further evaluation.  Therapeutic Approach & Follow-up:  The patient was subsequently advised to undergo serological testing for brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever. Simultaneously, an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed to evaluate for any possible intra-abdominal pathology or evidence of organomegaly that may coincide with her abdominal pain.  To be continued...  Please note that this is just a fictional clinical case example matching the writing style of your provided excerpt. It should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment purposes. Follow-up:  The serological tests for brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever were performed as part of the patient's further evaluation. The results showed elevated titers of antibodies against leptospira indicating a recent infection. A subsequent urine analysis was positive for the presence of Leptospira species.  Based on these findings, a diagnosis of leptospirosis was established. The patient was promptly started on appropriate antibiotic therapy with intravenous penicillin G as per national treatment guidelines.  Over the course of her hospitalization, the patient's fever gradually subsided, and she reported a reduction in headache and myalgia. She also experienced less abdominal pain and vomiting. Serial laboratory investigations indicated an improvement in leukocytosis with a decline in neutrophil count towards the normal range.  Throughout her hospital stay, meticulous fluid balance monitoring was maintained to ensure adequate hydration and renal function. Supportive measures such as analgesics for pain relief were provided as needed.  It is important to note that leptospirosis can have varying clinical presentations ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe life-threatening manifestations such as Weil's syndrome or pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome. This patient presented with an uncomplicated form of the disease characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and vomiting.  Discussion:  Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by spirochetes belonging to various pathogenic Leptospira species. Transmission commonly occurs through contact with water or soil contaminated with urine from infected animals such as rats or livestock. Individuals at occupational risk include farmers, veterinarians, animal handlers, and sewage workers who come into frequent contact with potentially infected environments.  The disease has a worldwide distribution but is more prevalent in tropical regions including South Western Nigeria where similar cases have been reported before (as stated in our initial example). Clinical suspicion should arise when patients present with febrile illness, myalgia, and a history of exposure to contaminated environments.  The diagnosis of leptospirosis can be challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms that mimic other common febrile illnesses. Serological tests are crucial in confirming the diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent disease progression and potential complications.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering zoonotic infections when encountering patients with compatible clinical presentations and occupational exposure. Leptospirosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in individuals who work closely with animals or have a history of exposure to contaminated environments.  Early recognition, appropriate diagnostic testing, and timely initiation of antibiotic therapy are essential for achieving favorable outcomes in patients with leptospirosis.  Further studies on zoonotic diseases and increased awareness among healthcare providers can contribute to earlier diagnoses, improved patient management, and public health interventions aimed at preventing transmission within both occupational settings and the general population.",create
"Clinical Case: A 55-year-old Italian man presenting with right lower abdominal pain and fever  A 55-year-old Italian man, with no significant medical or surgical history, came to our outpatient department complaining of severe right lower abdominal pain that had been gradually worsening over the past week. He also reported experiencing intermittent fever, reaching highs of 39°C (102.2°F) during this period.  The patient stated that the onset of his symptoms occurred suddenly without any identifiable trigger or preceding trauma. The severity of the pain led him to seek immediate medical attention. He denied any recent respiratory complaints such as cough, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort.  During the initial evaluation, the patient appeared tired and was visibly uncomfortable due to the persistent pain in his right lower abdomen. Upon further questioning, he revealed additional symptoms such as generalized malaise and loss of appetite but denied experiencing nausea or vomiting.  He clarified that in addition to his current symptoms, he had been feeling generally unwell over the past month with intermittent fatigue and muscle aches throughout his body. However, he attributed these non-specific complaints to normal aging processes and did not seek medical attention until now.  Physical examination revealed a slightly elevated body temperature (37.9°C/100.2°F) along with tenderness localized mainly over McBurney's point in the right lower abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. No abnormal findings were observed upon inspection of other systems including respiratory sounds and skin appearance.  Laboratory investigations were promptly ordered for further evaluation. Complete blood count showed mild leukocytosis (11×10^9/L) with a differential count within normal limits but an elevated C-reactive protein level (25 mg/L). Liver function tests were found to be within normal ranges while renal function markers indicated no significant derangement.  Given his clinical presentation combined with laboratory findings indicating inflammation without localizing features suggestive of visceral rupture or perforation requiring emergency intervention, the decision was made to further investigate non-surgical etiologies for his symptoms.  Abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing an enlarged appendix along with thickening of its walls. In addition, multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were seen along the right lower quadrant. No other gross abnormalities were identified within the abdominal cavity.  Based on these findings, a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis complicated by regional lymphadenitis was made. The patient was subsequently admitted for observation and initiation of conservative management including intravenous antibiotics and supportive care.  During his hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved with resolving fever and pain. Repeat laboratory investigations demonstrated a significant decline in inflammatory markers. Serial ultrasounds showed reduction in appendix size and regression of mesenteric lymphadenopathy confirming a favorable response to conservative treatment interventions.  The patient was discharged after six days with advice to complete a course of oral antibiotics at home followed by outpatient follow-up within two weeks for clinical reassessment. Written instructions regarding post-discharge care and warning signs such as increasing pain or recurrence of fever were provided to ensure appropriate monitoring during recovery.  In conclusion, this case highlights an atypical presentation of acute appendicitis without classical features like migration of pain or rebound tenderness but instead presenting as persistent right lower abdominal pain associated with intermittent fever and generalized malaise. Prompt recognition facilitated early intervention via antibiotic therapy leading to resolution without surgical intervention in this patient.",create
"Clinical Case: A 7-year-old boy presenting with abdominal pain and fever  Introduction: A 7-year-old boy was brought to the emergency unit of a local hospital in a suburban area at sunset. The parents reported that the child had been experiencing severe abdominal pain, fever, and general discomfort for the past two days. They had initially attempted to alleviate his symptoms by treating him with over-the-counter medication. However, due to worsening symptoms and concern regarding their efficacy, they sought medical attention.  Presenting Complaint: The chief complaint expressed by the parents was acute-onset abdominal pain accompanied by a high-grade fever persisting for 48 hours. They also noted that he had been experiencing episodes of vomiting and loss of appetite during this time frame.  Demographic Information: The patient is a previously healthy 7-year-old boy who lives with his family in a middle-income household. He has no known chronic medical conditions or allergies. There is no notable family history of similar complaints or hereditary diseases.  Medical History: The patient's medical history is unremarkable, free from any hospitalizations or significant illnesses thus far in his life.  Clinical Findings: Upon assessment, the child appeared anxious but mildly confused during interactions with both healthcare providers and family members present at the scene. The Glasgow Coma Scale recorded an overall score of 14 (E4, V4, M6), reflecting some mild cognitive impairment potentially attributed to discomfort resulting from his ailment.  Vital signs indicated mild hemodynamic instability characterized by blood pressure measuring 85/60 mm Hg (for age percentile), heart rate elevated at approximately 130 beats per minute (bpm), body temperature registered 38.8°C measured orally using electronic thermometer post-calibration checks; respiratory rate proportional to normal values for children within this age range at approximately 20 breaths per minute.  Physical Examination: A systematic physical examination was conducted on the pediatric patient focusing primarily on the abdomen. Abdominal palpation elicited severe tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant, indicating localized inflammation or irritation potentially suggestive of an underlying intra-abdominal condition.  Diagnostic Tests: To determine the etiology of this patient's abdominal pain, a series of diagnostic tests were ordered. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a mild leukocytosis with white blood cell counts elevated at 15,000 cells/mm³ (N: 4,000-10,500 cells/mm³), predominantly neutrophils. Additional urine analysis was performed to rule out any concurrent urinary tract infection; however, results showed no significant abnormalities.  Working Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings mentioned above, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis was established as a probable cause for his abdominal pain and fever.  Treatment Plan: The patient will be admitted to the pediatric surgery unit for close monitoring and further evaluation. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to maintain appropriate hydration status since there are signs of early hemodynamic instability. Consultations with pediatric surgeons will be arranged promptly to assess surgical intervention given the likelihood of acute appendicitis as per current clinical findings.  Conclusion: In conclusion, we have presented a case study detailing an acutely ill 7-year-old boy who initially presented with symptoms including severe abdominal pain accompanied by fever and subsequent vomiting episodes lasting 48 hours. Although further diagnostic confirmation is warranted to definitively determine the underlying cause such as appendicitis or alternative pathologies necessitating surgical intervention such as Meckel’s diverticulitis or mesenteric adenitis should not be excluded from consideration at this stage. Early diagnosis followed by prompt medical attention is necessary for optimal management in order to minimize potential complications associated with delayed treatment efforts.",create
"Case: A 55-year-old woman with persistent fever and joint pains  Background: Mrs. A, a 55-year-old woman, presented to our clinic complaining of severe chest pain, persistent fever, and arthralgia for one month prior to admission. She had a past medical history of hypertension but denied any other significant medical conditions or surgeries. Mrs. A was an active smoker.  Clinical Presentation: On examination, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 90 beats/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the small joints of her hands bilaterally and mild swelling in the knee joints. Additionally, she had limited range of motion in these affected joints.  Diagnostic Workup: Given Mrs. A's clinical presentation and medical history, further investigations were ordered to establish a diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment options.  Laboratory Findings: Complete blood count showed leukocytosis (15 × 10^9/L) with neutrophilia (78%), mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 40 mm/hr (normal range: 0-20 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level at 22 mg/L (normal range: <5 mg/L). Serum rheumatoid factor was negative. Repeated blood cultures yielded no growth after incubation for an appropriate duration under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.  Imaging Studies: An initial transthoracic echocardiography showed no evidence of valvular abnormalities or regurgitation; however, it did reveal mild pericardial effusion without signs suggestive of tamponade physiology. Considering these findings among other diagnostic possibilities in the differential diagnosis list for persistent fever with joint involvement regardless of any significant murmurs noted initially on physical examination; we decided to investigate further for potential infectious etiologies. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her knee joints was performed to evaluate the joint pain and swelling. It revealed synovial thickening, joint effusion, and evidence of bone edema in the affected joint areas. Synovial fluid analysis obtained by arthrocentesis from Mrs. A's swollen knee demonstrated increased leukocyte count along with a neutrophil predominance, elevated protein level, and normal glucose level. Gram stain result was negative for microorganisms.  Treatment: Due to her worsening symptoms and potential septic arthritis based on the synovial fluid analysis results along with persistent fever; empiric therapy consisted of intravenous ceftriaxone 2g daily plus oral doxycycline 100mg twice a day was initiated immediately until culture results become available.  Follow-up: Within two days after initiating antimicrobial therapy, Mrs. A reported significant improvement in her overall symptoms profile including resolution of chest pain and reduced fever. The patient remained under observation for further evaluation and management as per clinical guidelines.  Discussion: In this clinical case presentation, we described a middle-aged woman presenting with persistent fever and arthralgia associated with an inflammatory joint disorder that necessitated further investigations to establish an accurate diagnosis. She responded well to empiric antimicrobial treatment specifically targeting possible infective causes closely related to synovial involvement.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering infectious etiologies when encountering patients with persistent fever accompanied by articular manifestations even in the absence of overt valvular abnormalities on initial examination. Early recognition, appropriate diagnostic workup using laboratory studies coupled with imaging modalities like MRI as indicated led to prompt initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy resulting in substantial clinical improvement for our patient demonstrating good response within two days following treatment initiation.",create
"We present here a case of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) associated with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome in a 4-year-old female child born to non-consanguineous parents. Her birth history was uneventful, and she achieved all developmental milestones within the expected time frame. The family's social history revealed no significant concerns, and there were no notable neonatal or perinatal complications.  The patient's early infancy was characterized by normal growth and development. She began exclusive breastfeeding immediately after birth, and at the age of six months, complementary feeding was initiated without any difficulties. Her weight gain, length measurements, and psychomotor skills development were all within the normal range according to age-appropriate charts. The child had been described as having a healthy appetite, showing no aversions toward any specific foods.  Around four weeks prior to admission to our hospital, the child started experiencing intermittent fever exceeding 38°C (100.4°F) that persisted despite empirical antibiotic therapy prescribed by her primary care physician for suspected upper respiratory tract infection. Additionally, she complained of generalized weakness accompanied by decreased activity levels during this period.  Subsequently brought to our facility for further evaluation due to worsening symptoms and lack of improvement with standard antibiotics treatment: blood tests were performed on admission which showed pancytopenia with a white blood cell count of 2 × 10^9/L (reference range: 4-11 × 10^9/L), hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL (reference range: >11 g/dL), and platelet counts below normal levels at 40 × 10^9/L (reference range:150-400 ×10^9/L). Furthermore, laboratory investigations revealed elevated ferritin levels at approximately 3500 ng/mL (normal reference values: between15-150 ng/mL) suggesting possible hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).   In light of her clinical presentation, particularly the prolonged fever with associated cytopenias and elevated ferritin levels, HLH was highly suspected. Further investigations included bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which revealed signs of hemophagocytosis. Genetic analysis subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, oculocutaneous albinism, and neurologic abnormalities.  The patient's current management involves initiating treatment for HLH with etoposide and dexamethasone in an attempt to suppress the immune-mediated hyperinflammatory response associated with this condition. Furthermore, close monitoring for any infectious complications is essential given the intrinsic immunodeficiency present in CHS.  Given the rarity of CHS-associated HLH cases in pediatric patients, genetic counseling was provided to her parents regarding its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach involving hematologists and geneticists has been initiated to optimize her long-term care plans.  In summary, we present a case of HLH associated with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome in a 4-year-old female child presenting with prolonged fever, pancytopenia, and elevated ferritin levels. Prompt recognition and appropriate management are crucial for improving outcomes in such cases where early intervention may lead to better prognosis. Throughout her development, the patient's parents observed that she had fair skin compared to other family members, leading them to seek medical advice. Dermatological examination revealed hypopigmented areas on the skin, consistent with oculocutaneous albinism seen in Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) patients.  Neurological evaluations were performed as part of the comprehensive assessment. The child exhibited mild delays in language acquisition and fine motor skills. Neurologic examination findings revealed nystagmus and intermittent strabismus, suggesting ocular manifestations commonly associated with CHS.  Given the immune system dysregulation documented in CHS patients, thorough infectious workup was conducted to identify any ongoing infections that may have contributed to the HLH episode. However, initial blood culture results were negative for bacterial growth. Viral panel testing was also unremarkable, ruling out primary viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. Nevertheless, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was commenced due to her immunodeficient state caused by CHS.  In consideration of potential complications related to central nervous system involvement commonly seen in advanced stages of CHS progression requiring early management planning brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The findings demonstrated intracellular infiltrates within neurons- a characteristic neuropathological pattern compatible with CHS.  A multidisciplinary care plan remains essential for optimal management of this complex condition. Ophthalmology consultations will be scheduled regularly for monitoring potential visual impairments associated with oculocutaneous albinism and guidance regarding visual aids if necessary.  Long-term surveillance requires regular laboratory assessments aimed at preventing relapses or detecting disease recurrence promptly since individuals diagnosed with HLH secondary to genetic syndromes like CHS are at higher risk for reactivation episodes even after successful treatment initiation.  Immunologists will address her immunodeficient state through proactive measures such as vaccination updates and education on avoiding potential infectious triggers that could impose significant health risks. Additionally, genetic counseling sessions have been initiated to help the family understand the inheritance pattern and provide them with support and guidance regarding future family planning decisions.  The multidisciplinary team involved includes hematologists, immunologists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, and genetic counselors who will work collaboratively to manage her condition effectively.  In conclusion, we present a complex case of HLH associated with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome in a 4-year-old female child. This heterogeneous disorder poses challenges due to its multisystem involvement, characterized by immunodeficiency, oculocutaneous albinism, neurological abnormalities, and subsequent neurological deterioration as seen on brain MRI.

"Case Study: A 32-Year-Old Previously Healthy Woman with a Fever and Abdominal Pain  Introduction: A 32-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the hospital's emergency department with a 4-day history of high-grade fever along with upper right abdominal pain. The patient reported no significant past medical history and had not taken any medications. She worked as an office administrator and denied any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. Upon initial assessment, her vital signs were within normal limits, but she was febrile with a body temperature of 39°C. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  History of Present Illness: The patient initially experienced mild fatigue and malaise about a week prior to seeking medical attention. These symptoms resolved spontaneously after two days, only to be followed by the gradual onset of fevers reaching up to 39°C for the past four days. Associated with this persistent fever was increasingly worsening pain in her right upper abdomen, which was described as sharp in nature.  Past Medical History: The patient had an unremarkable medical history without any chronic illnesses or recurrent infections. She had never undergone any surgical procedures before nor had been hospitalized for any reason.  Social History: She lived alone and denied smoking tobacco or consuming alcohol excessively. Furthermore, she did not have any pets at home.  Family History: Her family history was non-contributory regarding similar symptoms or concerning illnesses among immediate relatives.  Examination Findings:  Vital Signs: Blood pressure - 120/70 mmHg; Heart rate - 90 bpm; Respiratory rate -18 breaths per minute; Oxygen saturation -99% on room air; Body temperature -39°C. General: The patient appeared ill but was alert and oriented. Skin: No rash or evidence of petechiae observed. Cardiovascular: Regular heart sounds without murmurs appreciated. Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal Examination: The right upper quadrant was tender to palpation, with no peritoneal signs or rebound tenderness. A firm and non-pulsatile hepatomegaly was found on liver palpation. Neurological Examination: Intact cranial nerves, normal sensation, absence of focal motor deficits.  Laboratory Findings:  Complete Blood Count: - Hemoglobin: 13.6 g/dL - Platelet count: 235 x 10^9/L - White blood cell count: 11.7 x 10^9/L (with neutrophils being the predominant cell type)  Liver Function Tests: - Total bilirubin: Within normal range - Aspartate transaminase (AST): Normal - Alanine transaminase (ALT): Normal  Imaging:  Abdominal Ultrasound: Ultrasound examination revealed hepatomegaly with no focal lesions observed. There were mild gallbladder wall thickening and mild splenomegaly noted as well.  Clinical Course: The patient was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential intra-abdominal infections while awaiting further test results. Additional diagnostic workup included viral serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses which came back negative. Blood cultures were obtained upon admission and showed no growth after 48 hours.  Discussion: This case presents a young woman presenting with fever and abdominal pain localized primarily to the right upper quadrant. She exhibited signs of systemic illness alongside hepatomegaly on physical examination without any evidence of peritoneal involvement or abnormalities in her liver function tests. The initial diagnostic workup did not provide specific etiological clues; hence, further investigations are warranted.  Conclusion: The clinical presentation of fever in combination with right upper abdominal pain raises several differential diagnoses such as acute cholecystitis, hepatitis infection, or non-specific viral syndrome. Appropriate diagnostic tests should be pursued to identify the underlying cause.",create
"Title: A Puzzling Predicament: The Case of Benjamin, the Curious Infant  Case Summary: This is the detailed clinical case of a previously healthy 7-month-old male infant, Benjamin, who presented to our pediatric emergency department with concerns raised by his parents regarding his recent anxiety and persistent crying for the past two hours. Benjamin's parents have no significant medical history or family history of congenital malformations. Additionally, there is an associated complaint from his mother about difficulty in bowel movements for the past two days and an episode of vomiting earlier on the same day. Interestingly, they also mentioned that Benjamin had sustained a head injury three hours ago due to falling backwards from a sitting position onto a soft carpet.  Presenting Complaint: Benjamin's parents expressed their worries about his growing anxiety and incessant crying over the last couple of hours. They noticed that he appeared to be visibly uncomfortable and inconsolable despite their efforts to soothe him.  Medical History: Benjamin has been thriving since birth with no known underlying medical conditions. He has been exclusively breastfed until recently when solids were introduced into his diet without any adverse reactions noted.  Family History: There are no significant medical issues in either parent's medical history or immediate family members' history.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination, Benjamin appeared restless with persistently distressed facial expressions suggestive of discomfort. His vital signs were within normal limits including heart rate (120 bpm), respiratory rate (30 bpm), blood pressure (90/60 mmHg), temperature (37°C) and oxygen saturation levels saturating at 98% on room air.  Gastrointestinal Symptoms:  1. Bowel Movements: According to parental reports, Benjamin experienced difficulty passing stools during intermittent periods over the past two days. 2. Vomiting Episode: Earlier in the day, he had forcefully expelled stomach contents through emesis which occurred once.  Head Injury:  1. Mechanism of Injury: Benjamin sustained a fall from a sitting position onto a soft carpet, resulting in an impact to the back of his head. 2. Associated Symptoms: Following the fall, Benjamin cried inconsolably for several minutes. There were no visible signs of external trauma, such as swelling or bruising on the scalp.  Diagnostic Investigations:  1. Cranial Examination: A thorough examination of Benjamin's head was performed, noting no evident signs of skull fracture or abnormal neurological findings. 2. Imaging Studies: Due to the minor nature of his head injury without alarming clinical indications, an immediate cranial imaging study was not deemed necessary by the attending physician. 3. Blood Tests and Urinalysis: To evaluate any potential systemic causes underlying his symptoms, comprehensive blood work and urinalysis were ordered.  Clinical Impression: Benjamin's presentation poses diagnostic challenges due to overlap in symptoms such as gastrointestinal distress and postural fall-associated distress.  Plan: To better understand and manage Benjamin's condition appropriately, we have initiated various interventions including pain relief measures and supportive care for gastrointestinal disturbances while awaiting further investigations' results. Close monitoring will be employed to ensure that any concerning developments are promptly addressed.  Discussion: In this hypothetical clinical case resembling real-life presentations encountered in pediatric practice, young infants may exhibit anxiety and crying related to various causes beyond simple colic or teething issues. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to maintain astute vigilance during evaluations while considering multiple differential diagnoses encompassing both gastrointestinal disturbances and minor traumatic incidents.

"Case 2: A 32-year-old male presented at the Aurora Medical Center on May 15th, 2021 with a complaint of a painful swelling in the scrotum. He had noticed the swelling three days ago (May 12th, 2021) following sexual intercourse with his regular partner. The patient reported that during intercourse there was no history of aggression, coercion, or use of drugs by either partner. There were no incidents involving instrumentation with other objects.  The patient described the onset of symptoms as gradual and progressive. Initially, he experienced mild discomfort in his scrotum which slowly worsened over the next few hours. He further reported that the swelling had increased in size and was now causing severe pain and difficulty walking.  Upon examination, a localized and visible swelling was observed in the right half of his scrotum extending towards the inguinal canal area. The affected area appeared enlarged and erythematous without any signs of ulceration or discharge present on inspection. Palpation revealed tenderness and induration around the swollen region.  Past medical history revealed no previous episodes of similar symptoms or any known genital infections such as herpes or gonorrhea. The patient denied experiencing urinary difficulties, fevers, chills, or any recent history of trauma to the genital area.  Further inquiry into social history found that he was not engaged in high-risk sexual behavior such as unprotected intercourse with multiple partners.  Given these findings and clinical presentation resembling an infectious process involving his scrotal region post-coitus activity without evident external trauma to explain it intelligently; preliminary diagnoses could include epididymitis or testicular torsion for further investigation.  Routine blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis were ordered along with swabs for cultures from urethra to exclude common sexually transmitted infections like Neisseria gonorrhoeae Chlamydia trachomatis apart from other main players in urinary pathogens which can infect epididymis like E. coli causing epididymitis while referring him to the urology department for a scrotal ultrasound.  Pain management was initiated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the patient was advised to apply ice packs to alleviate swelling and discomfort until further evaluation is concluded.  Patient education emphasized the importance of safe sexual practices, including regular condom use, avoidance of high-risk behavior, and prompt medical attention in case of any abnormalities experienced during or after sexual activities.  Follow-up will be scheduled based on results from lab investigations and radiological findings to guide further management accordingly as per urologist recommendations. Case 2 (Continued):  Based on the physical examination findings and initial laboratory results, further investigations were pursued to establish a definitive diagnosis for the patient's condition. The scrotal ultrasound, performed in the urology department on May 19th, 2021, revealed a hypoechoic area with increased blood flow within the right testicle, suggestive of acute epididymo-orchitis.  The patient was informed about the ultrasound findings and educated regarding his diagnosis. Epididymo-orchitis is often caused by an ascending infection from the urinary tract or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It was explained that bacteria could migrate from the urethra into the epididymis and testicles, leading to inflammation and subsequent swelling. Common causative organisms include Escherichia coli, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  Further investigations were conducted to identify any underlying potential infectious sources contributing to his symptoms. Tests for STIs including urine analysis for chlamydia and gonorrhea were negative. However stool cultures identified Enterobacter cloacae as a potentially isolated pathogen which could have led to urinary infection infection ascending later causing epididmo-orchtiis requiring lower abdominal ultradonography/CT scanning for further evaluation which suggested presence of left colonic diverticulosis without evidence of signs of complicated disease like abscesses or free-air under diaphragm.  Treatment was initiated with appropriate antibiotics targeting both gram-negative pathogens such as Enterobacter cloacae that aligned with susceptibility testing as well as empiric antibiotic treatment due clinical suspicion including ceftriaxone & doxycycline orally in accordance with guidelines routinely followed at our clinic while Broad spectrum antibiotic Colistin obtained sensitivity results awaited which is reserved for multi-drug resistant proposals specifcally but it addition may provide added advantage against Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter or other gram-negative rod pathogens later further investigation should be sought if results dont meet expected guidelines response. The patient was also instructed to continue with supportive measures such as scrotal elevation, ice packs, and analgesics to alleviate pain.  Follow-up consultations were scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment, track any potential complications related to epididymo-orchitis, and assess his diverticular disease status. The urologist emphasized the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics even if symptoms resolved earlier.  During subsequent visits on June 5th and June 19th of 2021, the patient reported a significant reduction in pain and swelling. Physical examination findings showed a marked improvement in scrotal tenderness and size reduction of the affected area. Laboratory tests demonstrated decreasing inflammatory markers indicative of an ongoing response to antibiotic therapy.  The patient was counseled regarding preventive measures for recurrent episodes of epididymo-orchitis which included practicing safe sex using barrier methods such as condoms, maintaining good genital hygiene habits, ensuring regular urination after sexual intercourse. Additionally surveillance colonoscopy was recommended five years later for diverticulosis disease since he was asymptomatic therefore dietary fibers intake & hydration alongwith physical exercises including maintainence healthy BMI index ocnsidered important aspects for long term management at present situation where acute phase curatrions wure being currently addressed.)  Overall, this case highlights the importance of clinical history taking along with appropriate investigations in arriving at an accurate diagnosis for patients presenting with genitourinary complaints following sexual activities. Prompt identification and management can help alleviate symptoms while preventing future complications associated with genitourinary infections.",create
"Clinical Case:   A 60-year-old man, living in Berlin, Germany, was admitted for evaluation of persistent fever over the past few weeks associated with night sweats and intermittent chills. He also reported feeling excessively fatigued, experiencing episodes of watery diarrhea, vague abdominal discomfort, and occasional non-productive cough. The patient had a medical history significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Upon physical examination, the patient appeared visibly tired and showed signs of generalized weakness. His temperature ranged from 37.5 to 38.5°C during the hospital stay. His abdomen was soft but tender on palpation in the lower quadrants with no rebound tenderness or rigidity noted. Further examination revealed hepatomegaly with mild splenomegaly palpable below the left coastal margin after deep inspiration.  Dermatological findings were also observed during assessment. A well-demarcated and raised erythematous plaque measuring approximately 4x4cm was identified on his lower leg along with large erosions covered by crusts on its surface. The lesion displayed a thin rolled border surrounding it but did not show any signs of exudate or discharge.  Laboratory investigations exposed certain abnormalities in hematologic parameters as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) of 15x10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x10^9/L) characterized by a predominant neutrophilic leukocytosis; hemoglobin level at 11 g/dL (normal range:13-17 g/dL); platelet count within normal limits at that time; elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 78 mg/L (normal range:<5 mg/L), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at Continuing laboratory investigations, a blood smear examination revealed the presence of numerous immature cells, consistent with a left shift. Additionally, liver function tests exhibited elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), suggesting hepatocellular injury.  Based on the patient's clinical presentation and findings, further diagnostic investigations were initiated. Imaging studies such as abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with evidence of multifocal hyperechoic lesions throughout the liver parenchyma. Splenomegaly was also confirmed as previously noted during physical examination.  Considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, a suspicion of an underlying infectious etiology was raised. Initial differential diagnoses included tuberculosis or an opportunistic infection in light of his diabetes mellitus status.  To further investigate these possibilities, appropriate microbiological tests were conducted including acid-fast bacilli staining of sputum samples and multiple blood cultures. These investigations produced negative results ruling out tuberculosis or other common bacterial infections.  Given the persistence of fever accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly and dermatological manifestations suggestive of an inflammatory process involving both skin and gastrointestinal tract findings noted earlier significant for diarrhea; it raised concerns for systemic involvement.  Further evaluation was pursued through serologic testing to assess for possible viral etiologies associated with persistent fever along with abdominal complaints. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab), human immunodeficiency virus immunoassay test (HIV ELISA), Ebstein-Barr virus VCA IgM antibody enzyme immunoassay test (EBV VCA IgM EIA) were all negative ruling out viral causes responsible for his symptoms.  However, it became apparent that due to persistent symptoms along with cytopenias identified on complete blood count analysis combined with deranged liver function tests warranted consideration tied to hematologic malignancy. Hence, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed to explore this possibility.  Expectant findings indicated hypercellular marrow with infiltration by immature cells exhibiting arrested differentiation at various stages, consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of an inversion in chromosome 16 [inv(16)], classified as a favorable risk factor based on genetic risk stratification. Molecular analysis showed positivity for the FLT3-ITD mutation, which further underscored the need for intensive therapeutic intervention.  The patient was promptly referred to a specialized hematology-oncology center where he initiated treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation therapy in order to achieve complete remission and long-term disease control.  This case highlights the diagnostic challenges encountered when faced with persistent fever accompanied by systemic symptoms. The diverse range of differential diagnoses requires comprehensive assessment along with judicious utilization of relevant investigations to uncover the underlying etiology in order to institute appropriate and timely management strategies.",create
"We present the case of a female patient, 65 years old, with a history of hypertension for the past 10 years on lisinopril and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years managed with metformin. She has been a non-smoker and denies any alcohol consumption.   The patient was admitted to the hospital due to sudden onset right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that started approximately 48 hours prior to admission. On initial assessment, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded as 13/15 (eye opening at 4, verbal response at 3, motor response at 6). The pupils were found to be symmetrical and reactive, and no sensory or motor deficits were detected. The osteotendinous reflexes were normal on examination.  Her respiratory rate was slightly increased at 22 breaths per minute while maintaining oxygen saturation levels of 98% in ambient air. The patient's heart rate was measured at a rapid pace of around100 beats per minute with blood pressure readings indicating stage I hypertension (145/90 mmHg).  Laboratory values revealed her capillary blood glucose level to be within range at approximately150 mg/dL. Urine analysis demonstrated moderate glycosuria without ketonuria.  Upon further investigation into her medical history during admission, it was discovered that she had previously been diagnosed with hypothyroidism for which she took levothyroxine daily.  Additional physical examination findings showed no signs of cranial nerve dysfunction apart from mild facial asymmetry upon smiling but symmetric movement during closure of both eyes tightly.  Diagnostic imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery distribution area causing right-sided hemiparesis.  Throughout her hospital stay, comprehensive stroke management protocols were initiated promptly following admission; these included ensuring adequate hydration, preventing secondary complications such as deep vein thrombosis, and early mobilization under the supervision of a physical therapist.  Further investigations were conducted to evaluate the etiology of her stroke. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed which showed normal cardiac structure and function with no evidence of intracardiac thrombus or any valvular abnormalities.  Given the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism, further laboratory tests were conducted. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), renal function tests including serum creatinine level, lipid profile, liver function panel along with fasting blood glucose levels were all found within normal ranges.  Furthermore, a carotid doppler ultrasound examination revealed mild bilateral carotid artery stenosis less than 50% on both sides without any significant plaque burden warranting surgical intervention.  The patient was closely monitored during her hospital stay and received ongoing management from the multidisciplinary team including neurologists, nurses specialized in stroke care management care coordinators for proper rehabilitation planning involving speech therapy as well as physiotherapy sessions to improve mobility.  In summary, we presented here a clinical case of an elderly female patient with a history positive for hypertension managed by lisinopril treatment alongside type 2 diabetes mellitus on metformin who presented with acute-onset right-sided weakness and speech difficulties diagnosed ultimately as an acute ischemic stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery distribution area. The patient was effectively managed according to established guidelines for stroke care leading to systematic recovery coordinated by an interprofessional team who focused on optimizing rehabilitation outcomes to promote functionality in her activities of daily living.",create

Elevated ESR levels consistent with inflammation and raised CRP values indicating an acute inflammatory process were discovered during laboratory assessment. Further diagnostic investigations are required to determine the underlying cause for this young man's symptoms and appropriate treatment will be initiated accordingly while keeping all differential diagnoses in mind",create
"Patient Information: A 5-year-old girl presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of limping and intermittent fever. Her parents reported that she had been complaining of right hip pain and had recently fallen while playing outside. The primary care physician initially suspected a hip contusion, and her parents were advised to give her over-the-counter pain medication and apply warm compresses. However, despite these measures, the child's symptoms persisted. Concerned, her parents brought her back to the emergency room for further evaluation.  Presenting Complaint: The major complaint in this case is a 2-day history of limping associated with right hip pain in a 5-year-old girl following an outdoor fall.  History of Present Illness: Two days ago, while playing outdoors, the patient accidentally fell onto her right side. Following the fall, she started limping favoring her right leg. Her parents initially thought it was due to minor discomfort related to bruising from the injury. However, they noticed that their daughter continued to complain of pain around her hip area and exhibited intermittent episodes of fever as high as 39°C for about 24 hours.  Past Medical History: The patient has no significant past medical history or previous injuries involving the musculoskeletal system.  Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination, there are no apparent deformities or abnormalities in alignment observed in either lower extremity at rest. However, when ambulating with assistance or bearing weight on her right lower limb alone, she displays an antalgic gait favoring the unaffected side due to pain in the right hip region. There is mild tenderness on palpation overlying greater trochanter (lateral aspect of proximal femur) without any skin changes or local warmth noted. Range of motion testing reveals reduced internal rotation compared to unaffected left hip along with slight restriction during passive abduction. Vital signs are within normal limits except for an elevated temperature of 38.2°C at presentation.  Diagnostic Approach: Considering the mechanism of injury, the presenting symptoms, and physical examination findings, several potential diagnoses should be considered. These include: 1. Hip contusion: Given the history of trauma and localized tenderness in the right hip region, a soft tissue contusion or hematoma could account for the patient's symptoms. 2. Septic arthritis: The presence of intermittent fever and restriction in range of motion raise concern for a joint infection, which can cause significant pain. 3. Transient synovitis: This condition typically presents with limping due to hip pain following a minor injury or viral illness. It is important to differentiate this diagnosis from more serious conditions such as septic arthritis. 4. Fracture or avascular necrosis: Although not as likely based on initial assessment findings, considering an X-ray or further imaging may be necessary if other diagnoses are ruled out.  Plan: To establish a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment for this patient, further investigations are required: 1) Blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood cultures will help evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation. 2) Imaging studies such as an ultrasound or MRI may be ordered to assess the hip joint structure further. 3) Meanwhile, non-weight-bearing status with crutch assistance should be advised until definitive diagnosis for both pain control by administering analgesics like acetaminophen/ibuprofen according to weight-based dosing recommendations along with RICE protocol (rest, ice application). 4) Close follow-up arrangements need to be made within 48-72 hours after diagnostic test results become available.  With prompt evaluation and proper management aimed at identifying the underlying cause responsible for this child's symptoms, her parents can find relief in knowing that appropriate steps are being taken towards resolving her discomfort and promoting her recovery.",create
"Case N°2: 35-year-old patient admitted to the emergency room for sudden onset of severe headaches, confusion, and loss of consciousness for the past 24 hours prior to admission. The family reports a medical history of migraines since the age of 18 years with infrequent episodes occurring once every six months or longer. However, in the last three weeks preceding admission, the patient experienced five migraines accompanied by nausea and phonophobia which did not respond to over-the-counter analgesics.  The patient's spouse recalls that about two days ago, following a particularly intense migraine attack, the patient developed flu-like symptoms including fever (38.5°C), body aches, fatigue and cough. Despite self-medication with paracetamol and vitamin C supplements recommended by their general practitioner, there was no significant improvement in these symptoms.  Overnight, while still experiencing residual headache pain from yesterday's episode, the patient suddenly became confused and disoriented at home. Shortly after onset of confusion lasting approximately ten minutes, they collapsed and lost consciousness for about one minute before eventually regaining awareness but remaining dazed.  The spouse further mentioned that since regained consciousness this morning until presentation at the hospital this evening; three more episodes were observed where they progressively lost awareness while speaking or performing simple tasks within 15 minutes each time without any convulsive movements.  Upon arrival at our facility forty-five minutes later via ambulance service due to persistent drowsiness alternating with periods of increased anxiety; no seizures were witnessed in transit fortunately. Considering these warning signs as an unprecedented occurrence post-migraine attacks previously undocumented within their medical history is cause for concern.  On examination in ER triage room initially conducted by attending nurse anesthesiologist; vital signs reveal blood pressure slightly elevated at 138/82 mmHg due to anxiety surrounding incident-events leading toward hospitalization so far today. Oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter likewise registers normally between 98-100%.  Patient's general appearance appears well-nourished and adequately maintained without any significant physical abnormalities externally noted. Pupillary response during inspection demonstrates normal reactivity to light. Auscultation of the heart sounds reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or added sounds while lung fields bilaterally appear clear with good air entry.  The neurological examination conducted by the attending neurologist focusing on cranial nerves discloses slight bilateral ptosis suggestive of Horner's syndrome along with diminished conjunctival injection. Motor strength, reflexes, and sensory perception when tested are within normal limits for this patient which assists in partially ruling out intracranial pathologies at this initial stage pending further diagnostic workups.  Given these clinical findings in conjunction with a prior history of migraine headaches followed by a flu-like illness preceding today's events; several differential diagnoses come to mind but require complete assessment prior to confirmation including:  1. Migraine-related complications such as migrainous infarction or status migrainosus. 2. Infectious etiologies like viral encephalitis or meningitis. 3. Vascular causes such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or vasculitides. 4. Toxic/metabolic disturbances e.g., drug-induced delirium secondary to recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs usage for headache relief.  In order to establish a definitive diagnosis and prevent further neurological deterioration, it is crucial that the patient undergoes an extensive battery of investigations including complete blood counts, coagulation profiles, liver function tests, viral antibodies titers panel (herpes simplex virus), lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis while chest X-ray plus head CT scan without contrast constitute reasonable initial studies based upon current symptomatology.  Pain management will be initiated using intravenous analgesics combined with antiemetic therapy considering ongoing headache complaints which may alleviate associated symptoms temporarily pending specialist consultation expected imminently with neurology team members.",create
"We present a case of a 32-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, who delivered uneventfully at term gestation. The newborn girl weighed 3.7kg and was born to non-consanguineous parents with no significant family history of genetic disorders. The mother had an uncomplicated pregnancy, attending regular antenatal visits and receiving appropriate prenatal care.  Upon delivery, the Apgar scores were nine and seven at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. However, shortly after birth, the baby displayed signs of respiratory distress and exhibited cyanosis along with decreased oxygen saturation levels. Given these alarming findings, immediate resuscitation measures were undertaken by the neonatal resuscitation team.  The infant was effectively intubated to secure her airway and facilitate effective ventilation since she presented with labored breathing patterns. Subsequently, she was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for further evaluation and management.  On initial examination in the NICU, the baby appeared pale with notable lethargy; however, no apparent congenital anomalies or dysmorphic features were observed upon thorough inspection. Her vital signs revealed a heart rate of 135 beats per minute with intermittent dips in oxygen saturation levels below normal range.  Considering these clinical manifestations suggestive of underlying cardiac pathology that might require immediate intervention to assure proper cardiac function during this critical period post-delivery; echocardiography was ordered promptly for further assessment.  Echocardiographic findings demonstrated suspected ductal-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD), specifically coarctation of the aorta (CoA). Further diagnostic evaluation indicated additional cardiovascular abnormalities consisting of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) accompanied by stenosis affecting both coronary arteries prominently as well as mild left ventricular hypertrophy.  In light of these results confirming duct-dependent CHD necessitating prompt treatment initiation to maintain myocardial perfusion, the baby was started on intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion and transferred to a tertiary care hospital for specialized cardiothoracic surgical intervention.  On transfer, the infant continued to be closely monitored in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU). Preoperative assessments including additional imaging studies and comprehensive laboratory investigations were conducted to establish a precise diagnosis, determine optimal timing for surgery, and evaluate potential complications or associated anomalies.  Following meticulous multidisciplinary evaluations involving pediatric cardiology, cardiac surgery, and neonatology teams collaborating joint efforts; it was decided that surgical correction of the CoA along with BAV should be undertaken. The procedure would involve resection of the narrowed segment of the aorta followed by end-to-end anastomosis and valvuloplasty. Given her stable condition at the time of decision-making, she underwent surgery without any delay.  Following an uneventful postoperative recovery period in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), she showed steady improvement in her overall clinical status. Serial echocardiograms demonstrated satisfactory anatomical correction with no residual lesions suggestive of complete repair.  Given her remarkable progress and favorable prognosis following surgical intervention for CHD repair; she was discharged home at 3 weeks of age under close follow-up by specialized pediatric cardiology clinics as well as routine early childhood developmental care assessments.  This case highlights the critical importance of prompt recognition and early management when newborns present with signs or symptoms suggestive of duct-dependent CHD. Collaboration between various specialties including neonatal medicine, pediatric cardiology, cardiac surgery teams is vital in ensuring optimal patient outcomes through timely diagnosis, appropriate interventions, post-surgical monitoring enabling long-term comprehensive follow-up care plans contributing to improved quality of life for these infants.",create
"Case 2: A 20-year-old single female patient, presented to the outpatient department complaining of unexplained weight gain and fatigue. She appeared to be of average build and nourishment with a normal height for her age group. There were no significant past medical history or harmful habits reported by the patient.  During general physical examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and conscious. Upon closer observation, she displayed sparse eyebrows without any signs of heat intolerance or sweating difficulties. Additionally, she had thin and brittle nails that grew slowly, along with deformed toenails.  The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. However, on further assessment, it was revealed that she had gained approximately 10 kilograms over the past six months despite no changes in her dietary habits or physical activity level. The weight gain seemed disproportionate to her usual body frame.  Exploring the symptoms further during history-taking revealed that the patient had been experiencing generalized fatigue and a decreased ability to concentrate during her daily activities. She also admitted having sporadic constipation over the past few months but did not seek medical attention for these concerns until now.  Upon conducting a comprehensive physical examination of both head and neck regions as well as systemic evaluation:  Craniofacial examination: The assessment showed elongated facial features with prominent cheekbones and mandible angle although there was no malocclusion found in this case. Neck examination: No palpable abnormality such as goiter or lymphadenopathy detected. Peripheral examination: Bilaterally pitting edema was observed around both ankles.  Considering these clinical findings combined with symptoms reported by the patient prompted suspicions of an endocrine disorder related to thyroid dysfunction. Consequently comprehensive laboratory investigations were requested including: 1) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level 2) Free thyroxine (FT4) 3) Antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO)  The results confirmed our medical hypothesis, as the patient's TSH level was elevated (7.8 mIU/L, reference range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) with a decreased FT4 level (1.2 ng/dL, reference range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). The anti-TPO antibody test came back positive.  Based on these findings and in accordance with clinical guidelines, a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was made for the patient.  The next steps involved educating the patient about her condition and discussing an appropriate treatment plan to help manage her symptoms and optimize her thyroid function. Treatment would include levothyroxine sodium supplementation in order to restore normal hormonal levels gradually over time while monitoring symptoms closely.  Additionally, counseling sessions were arranged for dietary modifications to alleviate any potential weight gain concerns induced by hypothyroidism.  Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor medication effectiveness, assess symptom improvement, and maintain a healthy doctor-patient relationship throughout her medical journey.  In conclusion, this case emphasizes the importance of considering endocrine disorders such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis when presented with suggestive clinical signs like fatigue, unexplained weight gain or loss of concentration – particularly combined with specific physical examination findings such as thinning hair or brittle nails. Timely detection and appropriate management can significantly improve the quality of life for patients dealing with endocrine dysfunctions.  Case 3: A 45-year-old married female patient visited the outpatient department complaining of excessive sweating, palpitations, and unintentional weight loss. She appeared to be of average build and nourishment with no significant systemic illnesses reported. There were no known harmful habits present.  During a general physical examination, the patient displayed thin eyebrows which seemed sparser than usual but did not show any signs of heat intolerance. Additionally, she had smooth and glossy nails without any deformities or abnormalities.  The patient's vital signs were within normal limits except for an elevated heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Further inquiry into her symptoms revealed that she had been experiencing persistent feelings of restlessness and an increase in appetite despite her recent weight loss.  Upon a thorough head-to-toe examination:  Craniofacial assessment: No visible craniofacial abnormalities observed. Neck examination: Palpation indicated a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland (diffuse goiter), with no palpable nodules. Cardiac examination: Regular rhythm with tachycardia noted during auscultation. Peripheral examination: No edema or other peripheral abnormalities detected.  Considering these clinical findings along with the patient's symptoms, it raised suspicions of hyperthyroidism as a possible underlying cause. Therefore, further investigations were requested including:  1) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level 2) Free thyroxine (FT4) 3) Thyroid autoantibodies such as anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO).  Results confirmed our suspicions as the TSH level was suppressed (<0.01 mIU/L), while FT4 levels were elevated (2.5 ng/dL). Both anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies tested negative in this case.  Based on these findings combined with clinical guidelines for hyperthyroidism diagnosis, a diagnosis of Graves' disease was made for the patient.  The next steps involved educating the patient about her condition, discussing treatment options, and addressing her concerns regarding symptom management and long-term prognosis. Treatment options included:  1) Anti-thyroid medications to block excessive thyroid hormone production 2) Beta-blockers to manage tachycardia and other cardiovascular symptoms 3) Radioactive iodine therapy or surgical interventions for long-term management in certain cases  The patient was started on anti-thyroid medication with close monitoring of thyroid function tests to ensure appropriate hormonal levels were maintained throughout treatment. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to assess symptom improvement, monitor side effects, adjust medication doses if necessary, and provide ongoing support.  Additionally, the patient received counseling on lifestyle modifications including stress reduction techniques and dietary adjustments that may help alleviate symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.  In conclusion, this case highlights the significance of considering hyperthyroidism as a possible cause when presented with specific clinical signs such as excessive sweating, palpitations, unintentional weight loss coupled with physical examination findings like thin eyebrows or smooth nails. Prompt identification and appropriate management are crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes for patients dealing with endocrine disorders like Graves' disease.",create
"A 22-year-old Asian female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department at St. Mary's Hospital in London, United Kingdom complaining of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain over the past three months. The patient described the pain as a dull ache, which would typically start in the early morning hours and last for approximately 30 minutes. She had noticed that these episodes were not related to her food intake or bowel movements.  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that she had been experiencing occasional palpitations and feelings of lightheadedness during these episodes of abdominal pain. There were no associated autonomic symptoms such as sweating or nausea. The patient also mentioned that she had been feeling increasingly fatigued lately.  During the initial assessment by nursing staff, the patient revealed that she had recently searched online forums for experiences similar to hers due to her concern about her physical appearance. She explained feeling self-conscious about her ""unusual"" facial features and hoped to find some reassurance from others who might share similar characteristics.  The nursing team noted that upon examination, the patient appeared thin with mild jaundice present in her sclerae but without any significant abnormalities on chest auscultation or palpation of peripheral pulses. Vital signs revealed a slightly increased heart rate of 98 beats per minute without any signs of orthostatic hypotension.  Given this presentation, further investigations were ordered for a suspected underlying etiology contributing to both her recurrent abdominal pain and associated symptoms. Blood tests showed elevated levels of liver enzymes with direct hyperbilirubinemia consistent with cholestasis; however, viral hepatitis markers were negative ruling out an infectious cause.  Additional studies including an abdominal ultrasound revealed mild hepatomegaly and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts but did not reveal any obvious structural abnormalities or gallstones within the biliary system; ruling out primary biliary cholangitis as a potential cause.  To assess for possible cardiac involvement, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed which demonstrated sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. Subsequent echocardiography showed normal left ventricular size and function with no evidence of valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities.  Based on the clinical presentation coupled with the investigations performed, a working diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome was considered. This benign, inherited disorder is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a deficiency in hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. The association between Gilbert syndrome and recurrent abdominal pain has been documented in previous studies.  The nursing team developed a care plan for the patient that involved reassurance regarding her concerns about her physical appearance and education about Gilbert syndrome as a benign condition. Furthermore, advice on managing recurrent abdominal pain through lifestyle modifications such as maintaining regular meal timings and incorporating stress-reduction techniques was provided.  Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her liver function tests and ensure ongoing support to manage both her physical symptoms and emotional well-being. The patient was also referred for genetic counseling to discuss potential implications for future family planning.  In conclusion, this case illustrates the importance of careful history-taking combined with appropriate investigations in diagnosing conditions that manifest as atypical symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of addressing patients' concerns about their physical appearance within a holistic approach to care delivery.",create
"Case 2: Mrs. HD, a 35-year-old female from the Tereos tribe presented to the hospital at term complaining of severe abdominal pain. She is a para 3 mother with two living children, both delivered vaginally. On examination, it was noted that she was in labor and fetal distress was suspected. After careful monitoring, Mrs. HD underwent an emergency cesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns.  The baby cried immediately after delivery and weighed approximately 3.5kg. However, worrisome findings were observed soon after birth when the attending pediatrician noticed multiple congenital anomalies involving the limbs and face of the infant.   Mrs. HD revealed that she had attended all her antenatal visits regularly and denied taking any medications during her pregnancy apart from prescribed prenatal vitamins. Her obstetric ultrasound scans had shown no abnormalities throughout the second trimester.  This child was born into a family setting where consanguinity was prevalent; Mrs.HD's husband is also a cousin of hers.  Upon further examination by specialized healthcare providers, they discovered that her newborn suffered from Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC), characterized by joint contractures affecting two or more body areas along with limb malformations such as clubfoot or absent digits in hands or feet.  In addition to these musculoskeletal abnormalities associated with AMC, other facial deformities were noted as well including micrognathia (small lower jaw), low-set ears, and an abnormal shape of the head commonly known as craniosynostosis—a condition where one or more sutures on an infant's skull close early before brain growth completes.  Further investigations were carried out which included skeletal radiography and chromosomal analysis to account for these complex anomalies associated with AMC in this newborn baby.   Results indicated normal karyotype (46XY) ruling out any chromosomal aberrations responsible for the congenital anomalies. However, skeletal radiography revealed that this baby had severe craniosynostosis, synostosis of multiple facial bones and fusion of long bones in both upper and lower extremities.  Distressed by the diagnosis, Mrs. HD recalled no family history of similar congenital disorders or developmental problems among her relatives. However, her previous pregnancies were unremarkable as compared to this particular pregnancy.  The treatment plan for this newborn was focused on maintaining a clear airway due to micrognathia which interferes with normal breathing patterns soon after birth. Discussions between healthcare providers and parents involved multiple surgical interventions required for correction of limb deformities at a later stage but immediate concerns were related to preserving vital organ functions considering such anatomical abnormalities. Coordination with other specialties such as orthopedics and plastic surgeons was initiated for a comprehensive management plan tailored specifically to address this child's complex needs.  In conclusion, Mrs.HD delivered an infant with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita associated with craniosynostosis - a rare combination demanding further investigations and multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals towards appropriate management strategies inclusive of corrective surgeries according to the specific requirements of each case.  At the age of three months, baby HD was brought to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. The craniosynostosis had been successfully corrected through surgery, allowing for normal brain growth and development. The shape of the head had improved significantly, relieving any potential pressure on the developing brain.  During this visit, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to evaluate other aspects of his health and well-being. It was noted that baby HD had difficulties with feeding due to his micrognathia. A feeding evaluation was carried out by a speech therapist who recommended alternative positions and specialized equipment to aid in his oral intake.  Despite these challenges, baby HD's motor skills were progressing well in terms of both gross and fine motor abilities. Physical therapy sessions were scheduled twice weekly to encourage joint mobility and strengthen muscle tone.  In collaboration with orthopedic specialists, plans were made for corrective surgeries to address the limb deformities associated with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita. These procedures would help improve functional independence by increasing range of motion and facilitating ambulation.  To support optimal growth and development, a balanced diet rich in nutrients was recommended for baby HD along with nutritional counseling provided by a registered dietitian. Regular monitoring of growth parameters ensured that he received adequate nutrition during infancy while appropriate adjustments were made as he transitioned into solid foods.  Considering the complexity of this case, genetic counseling sessions were offered to Mrs.HD and her husband as they expressed concerns about future pregnancies. The genetic counselor reviewed their family history alongside results from previous investigations but concluded that there was no evidence suggesting an increased risk for recurrence or inheritance patterns related to Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita or craniosynostosis within their lineage.  Throughout this journey, Mrs.HD displayed remarkable resilience as she actively participated in her son's care plan while seeking emotional support from family members as well as attending support groups dedicated specifically to parents facing similar challenges.  As baby HD continued to grow and develop, he required ongoing multidisciplinary care, including regular assessments by a pediatrician, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist, speech therapist, and dietitian. This collaborative approach ensured that interventions were timed appropriately while supporting the overall well-being of baby HD.  Mrs.HD's advocacy for her child's needs and her commitment to adhering to the recommended treatment plan significantly contributed to his progress. Despite the initial shock of multiple congenital anomalies associated with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita and craniosynostosis at birth, baby HD has shown tremendous resilience and continues to make strides in his development.  This case demonstrates the importance of early detection, timely intervention by specialized healthcare providers in managing complex conditions such as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita. By providing comprehensive care throughout infancy and childhood years while addressing specific needs related to growth, feeding difficulties, motor skills development - healthcare professionals can facilitate optimal outcomes for children like baby HD.",create

"Case 2: A 42-year-old woman presented to St. Mary's Hospital with a complaint of persistent abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss over the past month. The patient had no significant medical history apart from a cholecystectomy performed two years ago. She denied any alcohol or tobacco use but mentioned experiencing occasional indigestion after meals.  Upon examination, the patient appeared fatigued and her skin was pale, with mild jaundice noted in the sclerae. She displayed tachycardia and tachypnea, although her blood pressure remained within normal limits. The abdomen was tender upon palpation in the right upper quadrant, without any signs of distension or fluid leakage visible externally.  Laboratory investigations revealed decreased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit, indicating anemia. Furthermore, liver function tests demonstrated elevated serum bilirubin levels alongside increased alkaline phosphatase activity.  Considering her symptoms and examination findings, further diagnostic assessments were conducted to elucidate the underlying cause of her clinical presentation.  An ultrasound scan of the abdomen primarily focused on evaluating hepatic structures to discern any potential abnormalities that may account for this patient's condition. The results revealed multiple hyperechoic lesions scattered throughout both lobes of the liver concerning for metastatic disease. Additionally, there were signs indicative of biliary ductal dilation suggesting an obstruction downstream at some level within the biliary tree.  To gain a definitive understanding regarding the nature and extent of these findings, subsequent imaging studies were pursued utilizing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). This enhanced visualization established hepatic metastases as well as identified an obstructive lesion within the distal common bile duct at its junction with pancreatic duct - consistent with an obstructing periampullary tumor causing biliary obstruction leading to jaundice formation.  Given these findings and in consultation with gastroenterology specialists along with oncologists; it was determined that further tissue evaluation through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was crucial for both definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.  During ERCP, a biopsy of the periampullary tumor was obtained, confirming moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. In addition to this, an endoscopic plastic stent was placed across the obstructed biliary system to restore biliary drainage and relieve patient symptoms.  The patient underwent multidisciplinary discussions involving oncology, gastroenterology and surgical teams regarding her treatment options including potential surgical resection or chemotherapy. Further staging investigations were also initiated encompassing chest CT for metastatic workup which did not reveal any concerning findings.  In conclusion, a 42-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue alongside clinical signs suggesting anemia and jaundice. Diagnostic imaging elucidated hepatic metastases from a primary periampullary adenocarcinoma secreting bilirubin obstructing the bile duct system leading to jaundice formation among other symptoms. This case highlights the importance of prompt investigation in patients presenting with persistent abdominal symptoms in order to identify the underlying etiology promptly for appropriate management initiation. Following the diagnosis of hepatic metastases from a periampullary adenocarcinoma, our patient, Mrs. Smith, was scheduled for further treatment with a multidisciplinary care team. The team comprised of oncologists, gastroenterologists, and surgeons who collaborated to formulate an individualized treatment plan tailored to her specific condition.  Considering the advanced stage of the cancer and distant metastasis involvement in liver tissue, surgical resection was not deemed feasible due to the extent of disease burden. As a result, systemic chemotherapy emerged as the primary course of action to manage her condition and potentially improve overall survival outcomes.  Mrs. Smith began chemotherapy consisting of a combination regimen involving gemcitabine and cisplatin. The choice of this specific combination was based on its demonstrated effectiveness in treating periampullary cancers with distant metastasis while maintaining an acceptable safety profile for patients like Mrs. Smith.  During subsequent clinic visits for chemotherapy administration and monitoring, Mrs. Smith experienced various side effects associated with these medications including fatigue, nausea and vomiting which were effectively managed through appropriate antiemetic medications along with supportive care measures such as hydration therapies during chemotherapy sessions.  Throughout her treatment journey, regular follow-up appointments were essential to monitor treatment response closely and assess any potential adverse effects or complications arising from therapy initiation or disease progression.  Periodic imaging studies including abdominal CT scans allowed us to evaluate tumor response over time – assessing factors such as tumor size reduction or stabilization - thereby guiding clinical decision-making regarding continuation or modification of chemotherapy regimens according to response patterns observed.  Mrs. Smith displayed remarkable resilience throughout her treatments despite occasional setbacks due to side effects causing temporary dose adjustments or medication modifications by prescribing clinicians involved in her care management aligned towards maintaining quality-of-life standards alongside achieving therapeutic efficacy goals.  During recent consultations among the medical teams responsible for managing Mrs. Smith's case; it was decided that conducting another imaging study using CT scan-based evaluations would be crucial at this juncture to re-evaluate tumor response and progress.  The latest results showed a significant reduction in the size of hepatic metastases indicating a favorable response to chemotherapy. This positive outcome highlighted the efficacy of the chosen regimen and emphasized the importance of regular monitoring for optimal treatment outcomes.  Although Mrs. Smith's prognosis remains guarded given the advanced stage of her cancer, her resilience and positive response to treatment reaffirm our commitment to providing comprehensive care aimed at maximizing her quality of life while managing disease progression.  Moving forward, Mrs. Smith will continue receiving chemotherapy cycles as per her ongoing treatment plan, with further imaging studies scheduled periodically to monitor disease status closely. In addition to medical intervention, continued supportive care measures focusing on symptom management, emotional support, nutritional counseling, and pain control will remain integral components throughout her journey with cancer.  Throughout this clinical case illustration and emerging treatment narrative concerning Mrs. Smith's periampullary adenocarcinoma; it is imperative always to remember that each patient's experience is unique – necessitating personalized approaches encompassing shared decision-making between healthcare providers and patients themselves - promoting holistic care through interdisciplinary collaboration ensuring optimal patient outcomes are achieved alongside providing continuous support within a comprehensive oncological framework tailored precisely as per individual needs within pre-existing systemic constraints",create

"Case N°2 A 55-year-old Nigerian man with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was referred to the internal medicine department for uncontrolled hypertension, decreased urine output, and difficulty breathing. The patient had a history of ongoing medical care at the rheumatology department since 2002 when he presented with clinical manifestations and laboratory findings consistent with SLE, including malar rash on his cheeks, joint pain, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, fatigue, and hair loss.   The patient's past medical history revealed that he had been diagnosed with SLE in 2002 after experiencing recurrent fevers and joint pain for several months. Since then, he has been managed with various immunosuppressive medications such as hydroxychloroquine and low-dose prednisone to control disease activity.  During this current presentation to the internal medicine department, he complained of persistently high blood pressure readings despite compliance with his antihypertensive medications. His blood pressure was measured at 180/110 mm Hg upon arrival. Additionally, he reported a decrease in urine output over the past few days along with feelings of breathlessness even at rest.  Physical examination revealed classic features seen in patients with SLE – a malar rash spanning across his cheeks from nose to ears that worsened upon exposure to sunlight. He also had tenderness and swelling in multiple joints without significant deformities or erosions.  Laboratory investigations showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at a titer of 1:640 along with positive anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies further supporting the diagnosis of SLE. Renal function tests demonstrated elevated serum creatinine levels indicating renal impairment due to lupus nephritis.  His complete blood count indicated mild anemia characterized by normochromic normocytic red blood cells along with leukopenia characterized by reduced white blood cell count raising concern for potential immunosuppression.   Further evaluation revealed the presence of low complement levels (C3 and C4) in his serum along with proteinuria on a 24-hour urine collection, supporting the diagnosis of active lupus nephritis.  Given these findings, the patient was diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension secondary to SLE-associated renal impairment and active lupus nephritis. He was admitted to the hospital for further management and started on intravenous antihypertensive medications to achieve strict blood pressure control.

"Case 2  A 50-year-old Indian man, with a history of hypertension on medication and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in June 2010, came to our department in March 2017 for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past two months. He denied any associated symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or fainting episodes. The patient had no known history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or thyroid disorders. He reported being a non-smoker and occasional consumer of alcohol.  On physical examination, the patient appeared alert, cooperative and had normal body temperature. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg but otherwise stable. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed regular heart sounds without murmurs or additional sounds.  Further assessment through laboratory investigations was conducted to evaluate potential causes of his dyspnea and rule out any underlying conditions related to his medical history. Complete blood count showed mild anemia with hemoglobin levels at 11 g/dL (reference range:12-16 g/dL). Serum electrolyte levels were within normal limits.  A chest X-ray was performed to assess his respiratory system for any abnormalities contributing to his symptoms of dyspnea. The radiological examination revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD). To further delineate the etiology and extent of this lung involvement seen on imaging studies, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan was recommended.  The HRCT scan demonstrated bibasilar ground-glass opacities with evidence suggestive for usual interstitial pneumonia pattern alongside honeycombing changes consistent with advanced fibrosis. Immunologic workup comprising serum rheumatoid factor assay confirmed persistently positive results indicative ongoing activity related to his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis.  Given these findings suggesting concurrent ILD related to autoimmune-mediated mechanisms secondary to rheumatoid arthritis , management options were explored that aimed at both optimization control over patients' rheumatoid arthritis activity to prevent further lung damage progression and the treatment of interstitial lung disease.  The patient was referred to a rheumatologist for optimization of his current immunosuppressive therapy. He was started on disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and symptomatic treatment using corticosteroids.  Furthermore, initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation programs and supplemental oxygen therapy was recommended to improve exercise tolerance, alleviate the symptoms of dyspnea, and enhance overall respiratory function. The patient's response to these measures would be closely monitored with regular clinical follow-ups.  In conclusion, we present a case of a middle-aged Indian man with a history of hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis presenting with progressive exertional dyspnea attributed primarily to interstitial lung disease secondary to autoimmune processes due to his underlying systemic inflammation related to ongoing rheumatoid arthritis activity. Multidisciplinary management strategies were planned involving both rheumatologic care for optimizing systemic control over his inflammatory condition alongside pulmonology interventions aiming at symptom relief, improving overall lung function through rehabilitation programs, and supplementary oxygen therapy as deemed necessary based on regularly assessed evaluations during follow-up visits. During subsequent follow-up visits, the patient reported improvement in his dyspnea symptoms following initiation of the treatment plan. He noted a reduction in his exertional limitations and had a more positive outlook on his overall quality of life.  Serial pulmonary function tests were performed to assess lung function and monitor disease progression. Forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements showed mild restrictive lung disease with FVC values at 70% predicted (reference range: >80% predicted). Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was also mildly impaired, consistent with the interstitial involvement observed on imaging studies.  To further evaluate potential comorbidities or complications related to his medical history, an echocardiogram was performed. The results showed no evidence of pulmonary hypertension or other cardiac abnormalities contributing to his dyspnea symptoms.  With the patient demonstrating stable respiratory status and improved symptomatology over time, adjustments were made in his medication regimen under close collaboration between the rheumatologist and pulmonologist. Methotrexate dosage was optimized to provide optimal control over rheumatoid arthritis activity while minimizing drug-related side effects.  The patient continued attending regular sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which included aerobic exercises, breathing techniques, and education sessions aimed at optimizing lung function and promoting self-management skills. His exercise tolerance gradually improved as he gained confidence in managing exertion without experiencing significant breathlessness.  During one of these rehabilitation sessions, he expressed an interest in exploring complementary therapies such as yoga and meditation for stress management alongside conventional medical interventions. The multidisciplinary team supported this approach by providing information about reputable resources offering integrative therapies suitable for individuals with chronic respiratory conditions like interstitial lung disease.  Throughout the course of treatment, regular assessments were conducted to monitor adverse events related to medications such as hepatotoxicity associated with methotrexate usage or corticosteroid-related side effects including osteoporosis development or skin changes seen after long-term use.  The patient was educated on the importance of adhering to his prescribed treatments, attending follow-up visits, and promptly reporting any concerning symptoms or changes in his condition. Furthermore, lifestyle modifications were discussed to promote optimal cardiovascular health and minimize risk factors associated with hypertension.  Regular communication between the patient's primary care physician, rheumatologist, pulmonologist, and other relevant healthcare professionals facilitated a comprehensive approach to his care. This collaborative effort aimed at enhancing patient outcomes while providing personalized care based on his unique needs.  In summary, we present a case of a middle-aged Indian man with hypertension and underlying rheumatoid arthritis presenting with progressive dyspnea attributed mainly to interstitial lung disease secondary to autoimmune processes related to ongoing systemic inflammation. Multidisciplinary management strategies incorporating pharmacotherapy optimization under close collaboration between specialists alongside pulmonary rehabilitation programs resulted in improved symptom control and quality of life for the patient. Ongoing follow-up visits allowed for regular monitoring of disease progression while fostering patient education regarding self-management strategies for enhanced respiratory well-being.",create

"Mrs. J. is a 34-year-old HIV-positive Caucasian woman (gravida 3, para 2) who presented to antenatal care at 12 weeks gestation. She had a history of two previous cesarean sections and was diagnosed with chronic hypertension during her first pregnancy. Mrs. J's antenatal course had been uncomplicated until 32 weeks plus 4 days gestation when she developed sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding.  On admission to the hospital, Mrs. J appeared distressed and complained of ongoing lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. She also reported feeling weak and dizzy associated with intermittent episodes of vomiting over the past two hours leading up to admission.  Physical examination revealed a pale and slightly diaphoretic patient with elevated blood pressure reading as high as 150/90 mmHg, which was above her baseline readings during antenatal care visits.  A speculum examination was performed revealing active vaginal bleeding without any identifiable source in the cervical os or upper vagina.  Additionally, fetal movements were absent upon assessment by Doppler ultrasound prior to admission, raising concerns about possible fetal demise shortly before Mrs.J experienced symptom onset.  An obstetrical ultrasound scan showed evidence of placental abruption - detachment of the placenta from its normal position in the uterus - confirmed by an area of retroplacental clot measuring approximately seven centimeters in diameter.  Further investigation demonstrated abnormal coagulation parameters, including prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), low fibrinogen levels indicating disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) secondary to placental abruption.  Given Mrs.J's underlying chronic hypertension provided specific attention on blood pressure management included bed rest measures along with close monitoring for signs suggesting worsening preeclampsia such as severe headache or visual disturbances; thankfully these complications did not arise  An emergent cesarean section was undertaken due to the severity of her symptoms, and a stillborn male fetus at 31 weeks gestation, weighing 2.1 kg, was delivered. The placenta displayed visible areas of infarction consistent with abruption.  Mrs.J received blood transfusion for ongoing bleeding following delivery and underwent bilateral uterine artery embolization to control hemorrhage.  In postoperative period vital signs remain stable. Intravenous magnesium sulfate was initiated to prevent seizures due to the risk of eclampsia associated with chronic hypertension.  Mrs.J's recovery progressed well; her coagulation profile normalized gradually over three days following delivery without the need for further intervention. On discharge from hospital she received prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in addition to her preexisting antihypertensive therapy under close monitoring for potential complications such as thromboembolic events or worsening hypertensive disease.  In conclusion, Mrs.J's case demonstrates a rare but serious complication of pregnancy known as placental abruption occurring in the setting of chronic hypertension and significant vaginal bleeding accompanied by severe abdominal pain requiring emergent delivery to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality. Following her hospital discharge, Mrs. J continued to receive close follow-up care in the obstetric clinic. At her postpartum visit, she presented with concerns about persistent headaches and visual disturbances. On further evaluation, it was discovered that she had developed postpartum preeclampsia.  Mrs. J's blood pressure during the clinic visit was elevated at 160/100 mmHg. She reported intermittent blurry vision and frequent headaches that were not relieved by over-the-counter medications. Physical examination revealed bilateral lower extremity edema and mild epigastric tenderness.  Given her symptoms and physical findings, Mrs.J was admitted to the hospital for observation and management of postpartum preeclampsia. Laboratory investigations confirmed elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria in addition to persistently increased blood pressure readings.  To control her blood pressure, Mrs.J was started on intravenous antihypertensive therapy with labetalol along with oral magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis due to the risk of eclamptic seizures associated with severe preeclampsia.  Mrs.J's condition improved gradually over the next few days under close monitoring by both obstetricians and anesthesiologists to ensure appropriate management of hypertension as well as potential complications such as HELLP syndrome or stroke.  During her hospital stay, regular fetal surveillance indicated no evidence of fetal compromise or distress necessitating any intervention beyond supportive measures such as maternal positioning changes.  After careful consideration by the medical team regarding maternal stability, severity of symptoms, gestational age during delivery admission for placental abruption followed by premature birth due absence fetal heart sounds cesarean hysterectomy performed eliminating need future pregnancies being carried within this patient due high likelihood experiencing similar complications limited uterine integrity following previous cesarean procedures  Following stabilization of her blood pressure levels below 140/90 mmHg on oral antihypertensive medication regimen addition outpatient followup will be organized along social service involvement ensure requirement ongoing medical management related chronic hypertension addressed on individual case    basis.  Mrs.J's journey highlights the complex and challenging nature of maternal health complications that can arise during pregnancy and postpartum periods. The combination of placental abruption, chronic hypertension, and subsequent postpartum preeclampsia necessitated multidisciplinary care and close monitoring to ensure the well-being of both mother and baby.  Collaboration between obstetricians, anesthesiologists, hematologists, nurses, social services team members were essential for Mrs.J's successful outcome. Educating patients about potential risks associated with their preexisting conditions as well as encouraging regular prenatal visits for early detection of complications assumed great importance contribute management strategy overall outcomes women presenting similar circumstances  In conclusion although this imaginary clinical case demonstrates a patient distinct to Miss M from the original example parallels observed regarding complications arising in context specific patient history considered highlighting diagnostic challenges treating these conditions equitable manner safeguard minimize risk posed patients forefront providers minds",create
"Patient Profile:  Name: Sophia Oladipo Age: 35 years old Gender: Female Nationality: Nigerian Occupation: Teacher  Presenting Complaint:  Sophia Oladipo, a 35-year-old Nigerian female teacher, presents to the clinic with a history of multiple fractures over the past three and a half years. She is seeking surgical consultation for a possible diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.  Medical History:  Sophia's fracture history began with her first injury, which occurred when she slipped and fell while walking down a flight of stairs. This accident resulted in a fracture of her right humerus. Approximately six months later, despite non-operative treatment, the fractured bone had not fully healed when she sustained another fracture. This time it was her left femur that broke after an unprovoked fall on level ground.  Fracture History:  1. Fractured Right Humerus:    - Mechanism of Injury: Fall on stairs in dim lighting conditions.    - Treatment: Non-operative management.    - Healing Outcome: Incomplete healing within six months.  2. Fractured Left Femur:    - Mechanism of Injury: Trivial unprovoked fall on level ground.    - Treatment: Non-operative management.    - Healing Outcome: Pending assessment due to recent occurrence.  Clinical Presentation:  Apart from her history of recurrent fractures over the past few years, Sophia reports experiencing mild but persistent bone pain at various sites throughout her body. Most prevalent are intermittent pains in her lower back and hips that worsen with physical activity or prolonged periods of standing.  In addition to these symptoms, Sophia has been experiencing generalized fatigue and muscle weakness recently. She reports having difficulty concentrating at work and feeling easily fatigued even after minimal physical exertion.  Physical Examination Findings:  On examination, Sophia's vital signs are stable within normal ranges for blood pressure (120/80 mmHg), heart rate (72 beats per minute), and respiratory rate (16 breaths per minute). She is in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal examination reveals tenderness on palpation over her lower back and hips. However, range of motion in these areas is preserved. Neurological examination shows no signs of motor or sensory deficits.  Laboratory Investigations:  To further investigate Sophia's recurrent fractures and associated symptoms, several laboratory investigations are ordered, including:  1. Serum Calcium Levels: To assess for elevated calcium levels, which may indicate hyperparathyroidism. 2. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Levels: To evaluate PTH secretion by the parathyroid glands. 3. Vitamin D Levels: To determine if low vitamin D levels contribute to her clinical picture. 4. Complete Blood Count (CBC): To assess for any underlying hematological abnormalities. 5. Renal Function Tests: To evaluate kidney function as hyperparathyroidism can impact renal health.  Working Diagnosis:  Sophia's clinical presentation and history strongly suggest a possible diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to the recurrent fractures, bone pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty concentrating at work.  Management Plan:  Pending confirmation of the diagnosis through laboratory results, Sophia will be referred to an endocrinologist for a comprehensive evaluation. If confirmed as having primary hyperparathyroidism, further treatment options such as surgery to remove the affected parathyroid gland(s) may be considered to address her symptoms and prevent further complications associated with this condition.  Sophia understands that prompt investigation is essential for accurate diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment measures aimed at improving her quality of life while minimizing future fracture risks.

"Clinical Case: A 42-year-old female from African origin presented on 15/03/2021 with a range of symptoms including hyperpigmentation, fatigue, and joint pain that had been ongoing for the previous six months. The patient reported a gradual darkening of her skin and increased pigmentation in certain areas. She also experienced persistent tiredness and generalized weakness, often struggling to perform routine daily activities. Additionally, she complained of intermittent pain in multiple joints within the past year.  During examination, the patient's core body temperature was recorded as 37°C, her pulse rate was observed at 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measured as 110/70 mmHg. Mild pallor was noted upon visual inspection; however, no jaundice or cyanosis were present.  Examination of the patient's skin revealed generalized hyperpigmentation predominantly on sun-exposed areas such as face and forearms. Notably, there were distinct darkened patches on her elbows and knees. Gingival mucosa examination showed pronounced melanin deposition with visible darkening around teeth margins.  As part of further investigations into this clinical presentation:  1) Laboratory tests:     - A complete blood count (CBC) showed mild anemia (Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL). Other CBC parameters were within normal limits.    - Liver function tests (LFTs) demonstrated slightly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but other liver enzymes were within normal range.    - Renal function tests showed no abnormalities.    2) Imaging studies:     - X-ray imaging of the painful joints indicated mild degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis without evidence of inflammatory arthritis or fractures.     Based on these findings and clinical presentation, a provisional diagnosis of Addison’s disease was considered due to the presence of generalized hyperpigmentation along with fatigue and joint pain. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation.  Additional investigations were recommended to confirm the diagnosis:  1) Serum cortisol levels: These levels would help assess adrenal function, as a primary adrenal insufficiency could explain the hyperpigmentation and fatigue symptoms.     2) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test: This test aims to evaluate the response of adrenal glands when stimulated by ACTH, which is normally secreted by the pituitary gland. In patients with Addison's disease, impaired production of cortisol is usually observed.  Follow-up examination after three days revealed:  - Serum cortisol: 6 μg/dL (Normal range: 10-20 μg/dL) - ACTH stimulation test results showed little or no rise in serum cortisol levels following administration of synthetic ACTH.  These findings confirmed the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically Addison’s disease. Further management was initiated including hormone replacement therapy with oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone to adequately supplement deficient hormones from affected glands.  The patient responded well to treatment over subsequent weeks, reporting increased energy levels and a gradual improvement in joint pains. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her hormonal status and adjust medication dosages accordingly.  In conclusion, this case highlights a rare but crucial diagnosis that should be considered in patients presenting with hyperpigmentation, fatigue, and joint pain. Early identification and appropriate treatment can significantly improve their quality of life by restoring hormonal balance and managing associated symptoms effectively.",create
"A 45-year-old South African female was referred to Riverside General Hospital from her local health clinic for evaluation of progressive swelling and pain in her left hand. The patient, previously diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, had been managing her symptoms well until two weeks prior to presentation when she began experiencing increased joint stiffness and frequent episodes of joint inflammation.  The patient reported that the swelling started in her fingers and progressively spread to involve the entire hand. She also noticed a significant decrease in grip strength, making it difficult for her to perform routine tasks such as holding utensils or opening jars. While initially tolerable, the severity of pain has worsened over time. She described it as sharp and throbbing in nature, radiating up to her forearm and worsening with any movements involving the affected hand.  On further inquiry into the history of present illness, she revealed that three months prior to symptom onset she had discontinued taking methotrexate due to gastrointestinal side effects. She had also recently experienced a stressful event which coincided with an exacerbation of other rheumatoid arthritis symptoms such as fatigue and morning stiffness lasting more than an hour.  The patient denied any recent traumatic injury or infection affecting the hand or surrounding areas. There were no signs or symptoms suggestive of systemic illness such as fever, weight loss or joint deformities elsewhere in her body.  As part of a comprehensive assessment, a review of systems was conducted which did not reveal any additional findings relevant to this case. Past medical history was remarkable for diagnosed hypertension controlled by medication; however, there were no known allergies or other chronic conditions.  In order to evaluate this new-onset exacerbation in symptoms related to rheumatoid arthritis affecting primarily the left hand; laboratory investigations were performed including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels along with liver function tests given her ongoing medication use.  Physical examination demonstrated marked swelling involving the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the left hand, with characteristic fusiform appearance. The affected hand was warm to touch and there were tender nodules noted over the extensor aspects of both forearms. Range of motion at wrist and fingers was significantly limited due to pain.  Considering her clinical presentation, disease course, absence of trauma or infection; a diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis flare involving the left hand with recent exacerbation was made. The patient was advised to resume taking methotrexate albeit at a decreased dosage along with introduction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief.  Furthermore, an orthopedic consultation was requested to assess the extent of joint involvement and any potential need for temporary immobilization or use of assistive devices. Physical therapy referrals were also initiated for strengthening exercises aimed at improving grip strength as well as maintenance exercises focused on preserving joint mobility.  The patient's progress will be monitored closely through regular clinic visits to optimize medication management based on treatment response and address any side effects encountered along this latest therapeutic regimen.",create
"Case 2 A 6-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of fever and severe headache accompanied by vomiting. The patient had no previous medical history and appeared lethargic during the initial assessment. On further inquiry, it was revealed that the child had a history of recent travel to an endemic area for mosquito-borne diseases.  The physical examination showed a temperature of 39.2°C, blood pressure within normal limits, and elevated heart rate at 110 beats per minute. The child complained of photophobia and neck stiffness upon passive flexion. There were no apparent rashes or focal neurological deficits noted.  Given the clinical presentation with high-grade fever and meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. Laboratory testing revealed pleocytosis (with an increased count of white blood cells in the CSF), predominantly lymphocytes, along with elevated protein levels suggestive of viral meningitis.  In addition to obtaining samples for CSF analysis, blood tests were also ordered. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis with a total white cell count of 15,000 cells/mm³ but lacked neutrophil predominance often seen in bacterial meningitis cases. Platelet count was within normal limits at 200,000 platelets/mm³.  Further investigations included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on both CSF and serum samples to detect common viral pathogens causing meningitis such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), enteroviruses, or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Results from PCR analysis demonstrated positive VZV DNA amplification in both CSF and serum samples confirming varicella-zoster viral meningitis as the etiology underlying her symptoms.  Based on these findings and clinical correlation with prodromal chickenpox symptoms observed by her parents just before her trip to an endemic area, a definitive diagnosis of varicella-associated viral meningitis was made.  The patient was started on supportive care, including hydration and antipyretics for fever management. Due to the self-limiting nature of VZV meningitis, specific antiviral therapy like acyclovir was not initiated unless neurological deterioration or additional complications arose. Symptomatic treatment for headache control and adequate rest were advised.  During follow-up visits, the young girl showed gradual improvement in her clinical condition. Resolution of symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting persisted over the next few days with no signs of neurological sequelae observed.  To prevent future episodes and increase immunity against varicella-zoster virus infection, it was advised that she receive vaccination against chickenpox if she had not been immunized previously. Moreover, her family was informed about possible contagiousness before presentation with rash development in children who had recent contact or exposure to active chickenpox cases.  In conclusion, this case highlights varicella-zoster viral meningitis as an important differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with meningeal signs along with prodromal symptoms suggestive of chickenpox infection. A thorough clinical evaluation supported by appropriate laboratory investigations is crucial to establish an accurate diagnosis and guide further management strategies in similar cases involving children returning from endemic areas or those with recent viral infections. Case 3 A 10-year-old male was brought to the clinic with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and intermittent low-grade fever for the past week. The child had a medical history of frequent respiratory tract infections but no significant chronic illnesses.  Upon physical examination, the patient appeared pale with mild scleral icterus noted. His temperature was 38°C, blood pressure within normal range, and heart rate slightly increased at 100 beats per minute. Further examination revealed multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes on both sides of the neck that were tender on palpation.  Considering the symptoms and physical findings, a complete blood count was ordered. The results showed leukopenia with a total white cell count of 3,000 cells/mm³. Additionally, there was moderate normocytic anemia indicated by a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL and decreased platelet count measuring 120,000 platelets/mm³.  Further investigations were conducted to explore potential causes for these findings. Blood tests including serological testing for viral markers such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were requested due to their possible association with lymphadenopathy and hematological abnormalities.  Laboratory findings revealed positive serology for EBV antibodies including IgM against viral capsid antigen (VCA). This confirmed recent infection or reactivation of EBV as a probable cause underlying his clinical presentation.  The patient's parents recalled that their son had experienced symptoms consistent with acute infectious mononucleosis following an illness around four weeks ago characterized by sore throat, fever, fatigue but did not seek medical care at that time.The presence of abnormal liver function tests involving elevated levels of transaminases strengthened the diagnosis further.  Supportive care measures such as hydration and rest were recommended during this stage since no specific antiviral therapy exists for treating Epstein-Barr viral infections. Close monitoring for potential complications was advised, particularly in relation to liver involvement.  During subsequent follow-up visits, the patient exhibited gradual improvement in his overall condition and resolution of symptoms over several weeks. His hemoglobin levels and platelet counts returned to normal range, indicating resolution of the associated hematological abnormalities.  The child and his family were provided with necessary counseling regarding infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV. They were informed about precautions needed during convalescence due to the possibility of post-viral fatigue syndrome commonly observed after such infections.  Additionally, they were educated about modes of transmission including saliva-based spread (kissing disease) and general hygiene practices aimed at preventing secondary infection transmission amongst close contacts.  In conclusion, this case emphasizes infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus as a common cause of lymphadenopathy and hematological alterations in pediatric patients with a recent history suggestive of acute viral illness. Accurate diagnosis through appropriate serological testing ensures timely management strategies including supportive care measures for symptomatic relief and minimizing potential complications related to this self-limiting condition.

"Title: An Imaginary Clinical Case: A 55-Year-Old Woman with Progressive Lower Limb Swelling and Respiratory Distress  Introduction: Mrs. Smith, a 55-year-old woman of British descent, presented to the hospital with a six-week history of bilateral lower limb swelling accompanied by worsening aches and intermittent cramps during ambulation. She reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 8 kilograms in the past three months, along with two weeks of intermittent fevers. Moreover, she experienced sudden onset difficulty breathing, initially on exertion which progressively worsened and was eventually present at rest. Mrs. Smith had not noticed any associated cough or chest pain during this period. Despite receiving multiple courses of oral antibiotics from her primary care physician in the community, she experienced little clinical improvement.  Presenting Complaints: 1) Bilateral lower limb swelling: Mrs. Smith noticed progressive swelling in both her legs over a six-week period along with associated discomfort. 2) Aches and cramps while walking: Accompanied by the swelling in her lower limbs were occasional painful sensations while walking.  Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension: Well-controlled on regular antihypertensive medication. 2) Hyperlipidemia: Managed through lifestyle modifications 3) Diabetes mellitus type 2: Diagnosed two years ago; treated with dietary control and oral hypoglycemic agents.  Current Medications: 1) Antihypertensive medication (name not specified): Taken regularly to control blood pressure levels. 2) Oral hypoglycemic agents (name not specified): Prescribed for diabetes management.  Investigations: 1) Complete Blood Count (CBC): Normal range values obtained for hemoglobin level (14 g/dL), white blood cell count (6 x10^9/L), differential leukocyte count, and platelet count. 2) Renal Function Tests (RFTs): Creatinine levels (0.8 mg/dL) within normal limits suggesting adequate kidney function. 3) Liver Function Tests (LFTs): All liver enzymes within the normal range, except for a mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase (150 U/L; reference range 38-126 U/L). 4) Chest x-ray: Unremarkable findings with no obvious lung pathology or masses noted.  Differential Diagnoses: 1) Chronic Venous Insufficiency: The bilateral lower limb swelling and associated pain could be a result of venous insufficiency due to chronic damage to the valves in the deep veins. 2) Malabsorption Syndrome: Unintentional weight loss, fevers, and swelling might indicate an underlying gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome leading to nutrient deficiencies. 3) Heart Failure: Progressive dyspnea on exertion and eventually at rest could potentially suggest heart failure as an underlying cause. However, there is no significant smoking history or pre-existing cardiovascular disease mentioned.  Management: 1) Compression stockings: To reduce the lower limb edema and alleviate discomfort due to chronic venous insufficiency. 2) Nutritional assessment: Evaluation of Mrs. Smith's diet and absorption capability aimed at addressing possible malabsorption issues contributing to her symptoms. 3) Echocardiogram: To evaluate cardiac structure and function, investigate myocardial dysfunction as a potential contributor to respiratory distress.  Conclusion: Mrs. Smith's case presents with concerning symptoms such as progressive bilateral lower limb swelling associated with pain while walking, unintentional weight loss, recurrent fevers alongside sudden onset difficulty breathing not accompanied by cough or chest pain. Although her clinical presentation raises suspicion for various differential diagnoses including chronic venous insufficiency, malabsorption syndrome, or heart failure related etiologies; further investigations such as compression stockings usage trial period along with echocardiography will help narrow down the list of possibilities leading us towards appropriate management and treatment options for Mrs. Smith's condition.",create
"A 25-year-old married female presented to the emergency department with a fractured wrist, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding following a car accident. The patient mentioned that she was driving when another vehicle collided with her car head-on. She was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the accident. The patient complained of severe pain in her left wrist and lower abdomen. There was no significant past medical history reported.  Upon arrival, the patient appeared conscious but visibly distressed. She did not report any episodes of vomiting or nausea and denied any chest pain or shortness of breath. Her vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  During physical examination, the patient's general appearance indicated signs of distress but without acute distress or altered mental status. Her head examination revealed no visible trauma or external injuries such as lacerations or contusions. Pupils were equal in size and reactive to light bilaterally.  Moving down to the neck examination, no cervical spine tenderness or deformities were noted upon palpation. Breath sounds were clear bilaterally with no crepitation appreciated upon palpation over the chest wall.  Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower quadrants along with guarding upon palpation. The patient winced during deep palpation over McBurney's point without rebound tenderness being elicited during assessment for acute appendicitis.  The pelvic exam was significant for moderate active vaginal bleeding originating from within her uterus rather than external sources like cervical lacerations or tears noted on visual inspection alone; there were clots present within this blood flow which suggests pooling inside instead where it normally should vacate under normal menstrual cycling patterns if due course continued undisturbed by tramatic events occurring nearby causing disruption either indirectly (accoustical) like head blows, or directly by physical means (such as objects inserting into the cervical opening).  Distal musculoskeletal examination reported a noticeable deformity of the patient's left wrist along with severe pain on passive and active range of motion. Neurovascular examination was performed to assess for any signs of radial, median, and ulnar nerve compromise. Capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds in all digits.  Based on the initial assessments and injuries presented, an x-ray was ordered for both the left wrist and pelvis to evaluate fractures or dislocations that may require immediate intervention or stabilization. A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and urine pregnancy test were also ordered as part of routine evaluation.

"Case Presentation:  A 45-year-old African American female was recently admitted to our outpatient department following a referral from her primary care physician. She has a medical history of mild asthma for 10 years and well-controlled diabetes mellitus for the past two years. The patient presented with an intriguing constellation of symptoms, including recurring skin lesions on her lower legs accompanied by intense itching and pain.  The patient reported that these skin lesions have been present for about three months, gradually worsening in size, number, and severity. Initially, she noticed small papules forming on her lower legs that eventually developed into vesicles filled with clear fluid. These vesicles would easily rupture, leading to shallow erosions and ulcers that subsequently formed thick scabs.  The affected areas were intensely itchy at first but later became painful, hindering the patient's daily activities due to discomfort while walking or even standing. Moreover, the patient mentioned experiencing intermittent episodes of low-grade fever during the preceding week before seeking medical care.  On physical examination, multiple dark-reddish papular-vesicular lesions were identified along the lower legs predominantly distributed around the ankles and shins bilaterally. Many of these lesions had ruptured spontaneously or due to scratching by the patient before presentation to our clinic.  Laboratory investigations revealed normal complete blood count (CBC) parameters including white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), and platelet levels; however there was slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process in view of fever presentation associated with skin lesions. Additionally, random blood glucose levels were within acceptable limits indicating good glycemic control in line with routine management for diabetes mellitus.  Given these findings consistent with bullous pemphigoid based on clinical features such as recurring blistering eruptions predominantly affecting the lower limb region along with associated itching and pain paused grounds for further confirmation through appropriate laboratory workup.  Considering the patient's medical history of mild asthma as well as diabetes mellitus, it is important to thoroughly evaluate for any associated co-morbidities or potential drug interactions occurring between her current medications and newly prescribed treatments for pemphigoid.  A plan was initiated to obtain skin biopsies from representative lesion sites on the lower legs for histopathological examination. Immunofluorescence studies will also be performed on these biopsy samples to confirm the presence of immunoglobulin (IgG) and complement components at dermoepidermal junctions, further supporting a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.  The patient was started on symptomatic treatment including topical ointments containing high-potency corticosteroids under occlusion in addition to oral antihistamines to alleviate itching. Adequate wound care measures were addressed with regular cleansing and application of sterile dressings over ulcerated areas, ensuring appropriate healing and prevention of secondary infection.  Close follow-up was planned to monitor disease progression, response to treatment interventions, and titrate medications based on clinical response. The importance of continuing glycemic control for diabetes management was emphasized during counseling sessions facilitated by our dedicated diabetic nurse educator.  In conclusion, we present a case involving an African American female who presented with recurrent skin lesions predominantly affecting her lower legs associated with intense itching, pain, and low-grade fever. The current evidence suggests a potential diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid; however further laboratory confirmation is essential before initiating specific treatment modalities tailored towards individual symptomatology along with concomitant therapy incorporating her history regarding underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus which are profoundly inter-related in terms both pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies involved warranting an integrated interdisciplinary approach.",create
"On the 15th of October, 2021, a 42-year-old male patient presented to the Emergency Department of St. Mary's Hospital in New York City. The patient was referred to the dental clinic with complaints of severe tooth pain in his lower right jaw. He reported that he had undergone a root canal treatment on tooth number 30 approximately two months ago and now experienced significant discomfort.  During the initial examination, it was noted that tooth number 30 appeared intact without any visible cracks or fractures. However, there was moderate tenderness upon palpation and percussion tests indicated possible inflammation or infection in the root canal-treated tooth.  To further evaluate the situation, an intraoral radiographic examination was performed using digital imaging technology. The radiographs revealed no evidence of vertical fractures but showed signs of periapical rarefying osteitis at the apex of tooth number 30 (Figure 1). This finding directed us towards considering possibilities such as persistent infection or inadequate sealing of the root canal.  Following discussion with the patient, it was decided to proceed with exploratory treatment to alleviate his symptoms and identify any potential causes for his ongoing discomfort. Local anesthesia was administered at the site, ensuring adequate numbing for pain-free procedures throughout.  A rubber dam isolation technique was utilized before removing any existing restorations on tooth number 30 for better access during evaluation and subsequent procedures. After removal, careful examination showed no visible cracks on any surfaces of the tooth structure; however, there were signs suggesting subgingival crown margin placement (Figure 2).  Given this finding and its potential effects on periodontal health surrounding both neighboring teeth and supporting tissues around number 30 respectively; it became crucially important to consider crown lengthening as part of comprehensive treatment planning.  Consulting with an oral surgeon specializing in periodontics within our dental department ensured appropriate management options were discussed with our patient thoroughly before proceeding further.  On November XXth(left intentionally for specific date notations), the patient attended a scheduled appointment in the Periodontal Department at St. Mary's Hospital. A specialist periodontist performed the crown-lengthening procedure under local anesthesia, making an incision along the gingival margin and gently repositioning it apically towards exposing additional tooth structure (Figure 3). Following this, meticulous removal of any hyperplastic gingiva around tooth number 30 and neighboring teeth was performed to establish optimal access for future restorative procedures.  The patient tolerated the procedure well under oral sedation protocol and reported minimal discomfort during recovery phase while adhering to post-operative instructions including maintenance of good oral hygiene practices.  This approach aimed at achieving ideal biological width relative to the tooth structure, which is essential for long-term success in cases involving subgingival margins such as that observed in our patient's previous dental restoration.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled two weeks later to monitor healing progress and assess suitability for further definitive restoration on tooth number 30.  In conclusion, we presented a case of a middle-aged male complaining of persistent pain following root canal treatment. Through careful evaluation including clinical examination, radiographic findings, collaboration with specialists in various disciplines within dentistry; we identified subgingival crown margin placement as a possible etiological factor contributing to his symptoms. The subsequent application of crown lengthening procedure aims at establishing proper biological width necessary for successfullong-termmanagementoftheaffectedtoothand supporting tissues. The case continues under observation with further appointments planned accordingly.",create
"Case Study: A 52-year-old Female with a Suspected Brain Lesion in the Context of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Introduction: A 52-year-old female of African American origin was referred to our department in August 2019 by her primary care physician due to concerns about a brain lesion. The patient has a known history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been undergoing treatment for the condition since she was diagnosed at the age of 28. In addition, she has recently complained of mild cognitive impairments and persistent headaches, prompting further investigation.  Patient Background: The patient was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She first presented with symptoms suggestive of SLE, including fatigue, joint pain, photosensitivity, and oral ulcers when she was only 28 years old. Extensive diagnostic workup confirmed the diagnosis through positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test results along with skin biopsy findings consistent with SLE.  Medical History: Since her diagnosis, the patient has been managed predominantly by immunosuppressive therapy using corticosteroids as well as hydroxychloroquine. She occasionally requires increased doses during flares characterized by arthritis or skin rashes. Fortunately, despite experiencing occasional mild flare-ups over the years involving articular manifestations (mainly non-erosive arthritis), mucocutaneous involvement (photosensitive rashes), and serositis (pleuritis/pericarditis), she had no significant major organ involvement until now.  Current Presentation: The patient complains of frequent headaches localized around her left frontal region accompanied by mild cognitive disturbances including short-term memory lapses and difficulty concentrating on tasks for prolonged periods. These complaints have persisted for approximately four months before seeking medical attention. Neurological examination reveals no abnormalities apart from an isolated tenderness upon palpation at the left frontal side of her scalp.  Investigation Findings: Considering her newly emerging neurological complaints, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain. The results revealed a cystic lesion in the left frontal lobe region. Of note, prior to her visit with our department, she had visited various alternative medicine practitioners in an attempt to find non-traditional remedies for her SLE. One such practitioner suggested that her cognitive impairments and headaches might be due to scleroderma involvement in the brain. To support this claim, she had obtained an MRI scan of her brain outside of our healthcare system.  Conclusion: In summary, we present a clinical case involving a 52-year-old female with long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus who now presents with cognitive impairments and headaches alongside evidence of a cystic lesion on brain imaging studies. We acknowledge that some alternative medical practitioners may speculate about other undiagnosed conditions possibly related to scleroderma; however, further investigations are necessary before making any conclusions regarding the etiology and significance of the cerebral lesion seen on imaging.  Next Steps: In order to establish a definitive diagnosis for this patient's neurological symptoms and assess whether they are indeed related to SLE or another underlying condition, we intend to proceed with additional investigations such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis for biomarkers indicative of central nervous system involvement in autoimmune diseases and possible neurological consults for specialized evaluation.  Patient's prognosis will depend on accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment interventions tailored specifically towards addressing both systemic lupus erythematosus-related manifestations and probable underlying cerebral pathology.  (Note: This clinical case is entirely fictional but written using real statements found within medical contexts.)",create
"Patient 2: a 24-year-old female (46, XX karyotype), hailing from a small village in the Kairouan Governorate, Tunisia, was referred to our department for evaluation of hormonal imbalances. She was born to non-consanguineous parents with an unremarkable family history.   The patient presented with a myriad of symptoms that had progressively emerged over the past few years. She reported experiencing irregular menstrual cycles, marked by unpredictable delays and excessive bleeding. In addition, she had noticed an increase in body hair growth, particularly on her face and chest. These distressing symptoms had profoundly affected her self-esteem and quality of life.  Upon thorough examination, it was evident that the patient exhibited signs of hirsutism with coarse dark hair covering her upper lip and chin region. She also displayed mild acne along her jawline and excessive hair loss on her scalp. Additionally, during physical examination, we observed an advanced bone age compared to expected chronological age when assessing hand x-rays.  Given these findings, we deemed it necessary to investigate further into the possible etiologies contributing to this clinical picture.  Laboratory tests were conducted to assess hormone levels in order to identify any underlying endocrine abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms. Results revealed elevated levels of circulating testosterone (hyperandrogenemia) alongside increased concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Conversely aldosterone levels remained within reference ranges. Furthermore serum cortisol concentration measured at 8am noted decreased levels coupled with low plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration indicating adrenal insufficiency (Table 2).  To narrow down our differential diagnoses we ordered genetic testing specifically targeting genes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis pathways. Results disclosed a mutation in CYP21A2 gene which confirmed our initial suspicion; Patient 2 was diagnosed with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH-21OH). This autosomal recessive disorder exposed the patient to an impaired synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone due to enzyme deficiency within the adrenal cortex.  To manage the condition, we initiated a treatment plan designed to restore hormonal balance and alleviate presenting symptoms. The patient was prescribed a low-dose glucocorticoid replacement therapy comprising oral hydrocortisone which effectively replaced cortisol levels and maintained adrenal function. In addition, dietary recommendations were provided in order to ensure adequate sodium intake as a compensatory measure for her aldosterone insufficiency.  Patient 2 was educated on multiple aspects of her condition including adherence to medication, stress management, importance of regular follow-ups and monitoring adverse effects like hypertension or electrolyte disturbances. Moreover, we emphasized family planning counseling highlighting future challenges related to fertility due to potential ovarian dysfunction commonly seen in CAH patients.  Follow-up visits were scheduled at regular intervals for continued assessment of clinical progress and medication adjustment if needed. Additionally, psychological support was extended employing individual therapy sessions aiming at addressing emotional distress accompanied by physical manifestations such as hirsutism or acne.  In conclusion, Patient 2 presented with classic features suggestive of CAH-21OH that manifested as hormonal imbalances resulting from an underlying genetic mutation within the CYP21A2 gene. An early diagnosis allowed for timely intervention ensuring effective management through hormone replacement therapy alongside comprehensive multidisciplinary care addressing psychological well-being concerns extensively associated with chronic endocrine disorders.",create
"Title: The Unforeseen Challenges in Rehabilitation: A Case of Sudden Behavioral Changes  Clinical Case: A 38-year-old Indian woman was admitted to the hospital for rehabilitation following a severe motorcycle accident that occurred six months prior. During the accident, she sustained significant injuries, including a spinal cord injury (T6 level) and a mild traumatic brain injury. The patient underwent initial surgeries and was subsequently transferred to our facility for comprehensive rehabilitation.  Initially, the patient displayed remarkable progress throughout her four-month stay at the hospital. She exhibited no signs of behavioral or psychological problems during this time, actively engaging in therapy sessions and adhering diligently to her treatment plan with enthusiasm. Her goal-oriented approach allowed her to make steady improvements in regaining her motor functions.  As our multidisciplinary team meticulously assisted the patient in achieving several rehabilitation milestones, we anticipated her imminent discharge from the hospital upon completion of various therapeutic goals. However, an unexpected turn of events disrupted our plans.  In what seemed like an overnight transformation during the fourth month of her hospitalization, we observed sudden changes manifesting within this otherwise determined individual. Disturbed by this uncharacteristic behavior exhibited by the patient over two consecutive days following discussions about discharge plans and returning home after intensive rehabilitation care; further evaluation involving psychiatric services became necessary.  The erratic behavior involved unprovoked episodes characterized by agitated combative behavior primarily towards caregivers and attending staff members during daily routines such as feeding and personal hygiene assistance. These episodes would also be accompanied by occasional verbal outbursts – expressing frustration or anger without apparent cause or trigger within immediate surroundings.  Given that there were no recent adjustments made to medication regimens or alterations in external environmental factors contributing to stress levels around that time frame, these abrupt behavioral changes raised concern among both rehabilitating professionals and family members alike.  Intrigued by this alarming development amidst an otherwise optimistic trajectory of recovery earlier on, a consultation with psychiatric services was promptly initiated. Ethically safeguarding the patient's well-being and ensuring her further progress became our primary focus.  The psychiatric service conducted an extensive evaluation, encompassing a detailed psychiatric history, psychological assessments, and therapeutic interviews. There was no evidence of any pre-existing mental health conditions or family history suggestive of similar episodes in the past. Additionally, pertinent physical examinations including vital signs and neurological assessments were within normal limits.  Taking into account all findings from the evaluation process, a differential diagnosis began to form with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) as a possible explanation for these unforeseen behavioral changes. Although rare in occurrence, NMS is an idiosyncratic reaction typically associated with the use of antipsychotic medications.  However, it is important to note that in this particular case, there had been no recent introduction or adjustment of medications that could contribute directly to NMS development. Nonetheless, clinical vigilance warranted collaboration between all healthcare professionals involved and communal decision-making regarding appropriate management strategies for this complex scenario.  To be continued... Given the absence of medication-related triggers, further investigations were pursued to uncover potential underlying causes for these sudden behavioral changes in our patient. Additional tests, including blood work, imaging studies, and electroencephalogram were conducted to rule out any organic or neurological factors that might be contributing to her symptoms.  The results revealed no evidence of infection or metabolic abnormalities that could explain the onset of symptoms. Furthermore, her brain imaging showed only minimal residual changes from the previous traumatic brain injury.  As the multidisciplinary team delved deeper into the patient's history and recent experiences, a crucial detail came to light. It was discovered that prior to her hospitalization for rehabilitation, she had been an active participant in regular counseling sessions for emotional trauma related to past events. These therapy sessions had been temporarily discontinued upon admission for rehabilitation due to conflicting schedules between providers.  Recognizing that psychological stressors played a significant role in shaping an individual's behavior and mental well-being alongside physical health recovery, it became apparent that addressing this aspect was pivotal in enabling our patient's holistic healing process.  Equipped with this newfound knowledge about her disrupted counseling routine coupled with discussions surrounding discharge plans serving as additional stressors triggering her combative episodes; clinical interventions focusing on both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches were subsequently initiated.  Collaborating closely with psychiatric services and resuming psychological counseling sessions offered key insights into understanding underlying emotional responses fueling her agitation and confrontational behaviors during activities where functional independence remained a challenge. Psychoeducation regarding coping mechanisms tailored specifically towards heightened distress related to impending discharge also became integral components of therapeutic interventions.  In terms of pharmacological management options considered cautiously given her complex medical history involving spinal cord injury; medications such as low-dose antipsychotics (benzodiazepines) were introduced under close monitoring by both psychiatric services and neurology team — ensuring optimal control over anxiety while minimizing sedation side effects observed previously on higher doses employed traditionally.  Rehabilitation efforts simultaneously continued, emphasizing a patient-centered approach that acknowledged and addressed her anxieties surrounding independence and transitioning back into the community. The multidisciplinary team implemented strategies to help her regain confidence gradually, working towards discharge goals in tandem with psychological support interventions to alleviate distress.  Over time, the patient's agitation gradually subsided as she re-established trust within her caregiving environment and developed healthier coping mechanisms to manage emotional turmoil. As discharge plans were eventually revisited, thorough preparations were made to ensure a smooth transition back home while facilitating ongoing psychological counseling sessions in an outpatient setting for continuous support during readjustment.  This imaginary clinical case underscores the critical role of considering both physical and mental health aspects when managing complex patients undergoing rehabilitation. Such interdisciplinary approaches facilitate favorable outcomes by addressing underlying emotional stressors that may impact an individual's overall well-being during this vulnerable phase of recovery.  By recognizing and adapting interventions tailored specifically towards each patient's unique circumstances, healthcare professionals can optimize care delivery and achieve comprehensive rehabilitation goals while enhancing social integration post-discharge for their patients.",create
"Patient Profile:  A 37-year-old male patient (weight 80kg, height 180cm, BMI 24.69kg/cm2) arrived at the emergency department with a high-grade fever (39.7oC), rapid heart rate (120 bpm), low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg), increased respiratory rate (28 breaths/min), severe throat pain, neck stiffness and diffuse swelling in the left lower leg region. He had been referred to the hospital by his primary care physician following complications arising from knee surgery performed three weeks ago. The patient's recent medical history also included a previous appendectomy and treatment for gout.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reported intense pain in his throat that had progressively worsened over the past two days. Initially, he attributed it to post-surgical discomfort after knee arthroscopy; however, he began to experience difficulty swallowing and noticed significant neck stiffness accompanying the pain. As a result of these symptoms, he decided to seek medical attention.  History of Present Illness: Three weeks earlier, the patient underwent an elective knee operation due to persistent joint pain caused by osteoarthritis. The procedure involved arthroscopic debridement of cartilaginous fragments as well as meniscectomy to alleviate his symptoms effectively.  His post-operative recovery was relatively smooth initially; however, during routine follow-up visits with his orthopedic surgeon for suture removal and wound assessment over the last week, he developed redness around the surgical site with local tenderness and warmth on palpation suggestive of wound infection.  Medical History: Apart from recent surgical interventions for arthritis-related issues, this patient previously underwent an emergency appendectomy four years ago as a result of acute appendicitis recorded on subsequent diagnostic imaging investigations.  Furthermore, he has experienced multiple episodes related to gouty arthritis involvement affecting different synovial joints throughout his body over several years. These attacks prompted consultations with his rheumatologist, who managed his symptoms using pharmacological agents and advised dietary modifications to control uric acid levels.  Physical Examination: Upon examination, the patient appeared acutely unwell with obvious discomfort. His throat was erythematous bilaterally. The oropharynx revealed marked tonsillar enlargement accompanied by purulent exudates.  Neck inspection elicited a limited range of motion due to significant pain and stiffness. Upon further investigation, diffuse swelling on the lower left leg was noted, compromising normal tissue consistency upon palpation without any signs of fluctuation or abscess formation.  Investigations: To determine the possible etiology of these presenting complaints, several investigations were ordered promptly:  1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): Results showed elevated white blood cell count (16 x109/L) with a predominant neutrophilic leukocytosis indicative of an active bacterial infection. 2. Throat Culture: A throat swab yielded positive results for Group A Streptococcus pyogenes. 3. Lower Limb Ultrasound: Imaging revealed marked edema in the subcutaneous tissues without any evidence of deep vein thrombosis or cellulitis.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical features and investigations performed, this patient was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis complicated by peritonsillar abscess formation as well as infectious inflammatory involvement in the left lower leg secondary to hematogenous spread from an untreated surgical wound infection post-knee arthroscopy.  Treatment and Management: The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotic therapy consisting of broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against Gram-positive organisms including Group A Streptococcus pyogenes as per susceptibility testing from throat culture results obtained earlier.  Analgesics were administered to alleviate pain associated with both tonsillar inflammation and lower limb cellulitis symptoms adequately. Close monitoring included frequent assessment of vital signs along with repeated laboratory investigations demonstrating resolution in inflammatory biomarker levels during his subsequent hospital stay.  Conclusion: This case presents a challenging scenario involving an unfortunate patient who developed multiple complications following surgical interventions. Acute tonsillitis with peritonsillar abscess formation and secondary hematogenous spread to the lower leg demonstrated the need for timely intervention, highlighting the importance of vigilant post-operative care and appropriate microbial surveillance to prevent such complications.",create
"Title: A Case of Abdominal Pain and Fever in a 12-year-old Girl  Introduction: This is the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with abdominal pain and fever. The patient had no significant past medical history, but she reported recent episodes of falling from her bicycle while riding in April 2021. This clinical case aims to highlight the diagnostic workup, treatment, and management for an adolescent patient presenting with similar symptoms to those detailed in the given example.  History of Present Illness: The patient visited our pediatric clinic with complaints of progressive right upper quadrant abdominal pain accompanied by intermittent high-grade fever. The onset of symptoms occurred two days prior to her visit and were not associated with vomiting, yellow eyes, loss of appetite or weight loss. She also denied experiencing constipation or any other urinary symptoms.  Initial Examination: On physical examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but was alert and oriented. Her vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate within normal limits for her age at 90 beats per minute, blood pressure at 110/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness over the right upper quadrant region without any palpable masses or organomegaly.  Further Investigation: In order to determine the underlying cause for this presentation, laboratory investigations were ordered including complete blood count (CBC) with differential count along with liver function tests (LFTs) which showed no significant abnormalities. An ultrasound examination was performed which revealed mild hepatomegaly along with evidence suggestive of acute hepatitis on liver parenchymal analysis. Based on these findings further viral serology testing was done including Hepatitis A IgM antibody test - which came back positive.  Diagnosis: The final diagnosis was made as acute hepatitis caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV). It was explained to both the patient and her family that Hepatitis A is a self-limiting viral infection transmitted through the fecal-oral route.  Treatment and Management: The patient was immediately started on supportive care, including hydration, proper nutrition, and advised bed rest. She was also instructed regarding personal hygiene habits such as hand-washing after using the toilet to minimize further transmission of HAV. In addition to supportive measures, symptomatic treatment for pain relief and fever control was provided using acetaminophen. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor liver function tests until complete resolution of symptoms and normalization of liver enzymes.  Outcome: Over the course of two weeks following initiation of treatment, the patient's fever resolved completely. Her abdominal pain gradually improved as her liver enzymes returned to normal levels. Follow-up ultrasound confirmed resolution of hepatomegaly.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering acute hepatitis caused by Hepatitis A virus in patients presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and fever. Early detection, appropriate management, along with public health education on personal hygiene practices can help prevent further transmission not only in infected individuals but also within the community at large. Discussion:  In this clinical case, the patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, similar to the case mentioned earlier. However, while the previous case involved a 13-year-old boy with nodding syndrome, this present case features a 12-year-old girl with acute hepatitis caused by Hepatitis A virus.  Acute hepatitis often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and malaise. Abdominal pain is also frequently reported and can be localized to different regions of the abdomen. In our patient's case, the right upper quadrant tenderness indicated liver involvement.  The diagnosis of acute hepatitis was established through a comprehensive evaluation involving medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations including liver function tests (LFTs), and confirmatory serological testing for Hepatitis A IgM antibodies. The positive result supported our diagnosis.  Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis due to Hepatitis A virus infection, supportive care formed a crucial part of management. Adequate hydration helped maintain fluid balance while bed rest aided in symptom relief and facilitated recovery. Emphasizing personal hygiene practices like proper hand-washing after using the toilet aimed at limiting further transmission within her family and community.  Symptomatic control played an essential role in managing the patient's fever and abdominal pain using acetaminophen. Regular follow-up visits allowed monitoring of liver function tests until complete resolution was achieved.  Over time, there was clear improvement in symptoms including resolution of fever alongside gradual reduction in abdominal pain. Resolution was further substantiated by subsequent normalization of liver enzymes observed during follow-up visits. Ultrasound imaging confirmed resolution of hepatomegaly - indicating successful management.  This imaginary clinical scenario demonstrates that even though patients may present with similar symptoms as seen in other cases (such as abdominal pain or fever), it is important to consider various differential diagnoses based on age group and prevailing epidemiology. Through proper assessment and investigation techniques tailored towards specific etiologies such as viral serologies, a correct diagnosis can be reached.  The clinical management of acute hepatitis primarily focuses on supportive care, symptom control, and prevention of ongoing transmission. In this case, prompt identification and initiation of appropriate measures facilitated a favorable outcome for the patient.  Conclusion:  This imaginary clinical case underscores the importance of considering a wide range of differential diagnoses when faced with patients presenting with similar symptoms. Through diligent evaluation and comprehensive investigation methods tailored to individual cases, accurate diagnoses can be made, leading to appropriate management strategies and positive outcomes for patients. Effective treatment encompasses supportive care, symptomatic treatment, as well as education on preventive measures to curtail ongoing transmission within communities.",create
"A 31-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of chronic migraine presented to our clinic with complaints of persistent headaches. He reported a history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches that had been ongoing for approximately three years. The patient described his headache pain as moderate to severe, which was alleviated by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Interestingly, he did not experience any worsening of his headache with physical activity.  The patient denied any accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura-like sensations preceding the onset of his headaches. He recalled that these episodes lasted for several hours at a time and were generalized in nature, affecting both sides of his head equally. The quality of pain was pressing in nature, causing him significant distress and discomfort.  When discussing the family history, the patient revealed that there was no known family history for similar headache conditions or migraines within immediate relatives. However, upon further exploration into his medical background, he mentioned a previous history of seizures occurring during infancy.  He elaborated on this seizure history occurring around six months old described as generalized tonic-clonic contractions lasting approximately one minute each episode. These episodes led to a prompt medical evaluation at that time and resulted in a diagnosis of benign febrile convulsions which spontaneously resolved over time without further intervention.  Furthermore, during childhood and adolescence, there were no documented instances or recurring episodes suggestive of additional seizure activity following infancy stages.  In terms of our current evaluation at the clinic visit, a comprehensive physical examination was performed leading to unremarkable findings pertaining to vital signs and neurological examinations.  Based on this clinical presentation along with supporting historical information about recurrent headaches without concerning features such as worsening with exertion or associated aura symptoms like visual disturbances or sensory changes being absent, we formulated an initial working diagnosis consistent with chronic migraine syndrome without aura (ICHD-3 criteria).  Considering the duration and frequency of these headaches reported by our patient along with their impact on daily functioning, we decided to initiate a treatment plan targeting both acute episodic management and preventive measures for long-term control.  Management options discussed included lifestyle modifications, stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, and the use of abortive therapy during acute episodes. The patient was educated about potential triggers such as sleep disturbances, food triggers (specifically caffeine-related products), alcohol consumption, and stress levels. Avoidance of these modifiable factors was strongly emphasized.  Furthermore, we prescribed a triptan medication as an abortive agent which the patient was advised to take at the onset of his headaches or as soon as possible after their commencement to increase its effectiveness.  Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to evaluate the response to this treatment plan and make any necessary modifications accordingly. The patient's compliance with prescribed medications along with adherence to recommended lifestyle changes would be paramount in achieving optimal headache control while minimizing associated burden on daily function and overall quality of life.  In conclusion, this case highlights a 31-year-old male patient presenting with chronic migraines without aura who experienced persistent non-pulsating headaches lasting several hours. Although his seizure history during infancy suggests no direct correlation between the two conditions observed in his medical background thus far. This case emphasizes the need for appropriate evaluation and tailored management strategies for patients suffering from chronic migraines in order to optimize their outcomes effectively.",create
"Ms. JAS, a 45-year-old woman, presented at her primary care clinic on June 15, 2022 with a six-month history of intermittent chest discomfort and palpitations. These symptoms primarily occurred during periods of rest and in stressful situations such as driving her car. She reported experiencing paroxysmal episodes that were accompanied by dizziness, light-headedness, and brief episodes of blurred vision.  During the episodes, Ms. JAS noted a rapid pounding sensation in her chest preceding the onset of dizziness. She denied any associated shortness of breath or other stress-related symptoms like sweating or anxiety. Her medical history is significant for being overweight (BMI=31) and having a positive family history of sudden cardiac death due to unknown causes.  On physical examination, Ms. JAS appeared well with vital signs within normal limits – blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg; heart rate: 84 bpm; respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute; temperature: 98°F (36.7°C). Her cardiovascular exam was unremarkable aside from an irregular heartbeat consistent with atrial fibrillation on auscultation.  Given her symptoms and physical findings, further investigations were warranted to evaluate the underlying cause of Ms. JAS's symptoms and rule out any potentially serious conditions that could be contributing to her presentation.  A complete blood count analysis showed no significant abnormalities except for mildly elevated total cholesterol levels at 215 mg/dL (normal range: <200 mg/dL). Thyroid function tests were within normal limits ruling out hyperthyroidism as a potential cause for her palpitations.  An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (heart rate ~120 bpm) without any evidence of ischemic changes or conduction abnormalities present in sinus rhythm ECG recordings obtained previously for comparison.  To further evaluate the functional status and overall health condition including coronary artery disease risk assessment, a stress echocardiogram was performed. The test revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function with no regional wall motion abnormalities observed during exercise. However, stress-induced hypotension was noted during the test, which correlated with Ms. JAS experiencing lightheadedness and blurred vision.  Based on the clinical picture and investigations, a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with associated dizziness (lipothymia) secondary to rapid ventricular response and potentially stress-induced hypotension was made.  Treatment options were then discussed with Ms. JAS while highlighting the importance of managing her cardiovascular risk factors. She was prescribed a beta-blocker medication to control her heart rate and reduce symptom severity during episodes of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, lifestyle modifications including weight reduction through dietary changes and regular exercise were strongly advised.  A follow-up appointment in two weeks' time was scheduled to assess treatment response and monitor for any adverse effects related to the medication prescribed while continuing close monitoring of her cardiovascular health through periodic medical assessments.  In summary, Ms. JAS presented with paroxysmal palpitations accompanied by dizziness and blurred vision at rest as well as stressful situations like driving. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and stress echocardiography, she received a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with associated symptoms attributable to rapid ventricular response and potential stress-induced hypotension in her case related to underlying cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity (BMI=31). A targeted management plan incorporating medical therapy alongside lifestyle modifications was implemented aiming for symptom control while optimizing long-term cardiovascular health outcomes for Ms. JAS.",create
"Case 2: A 55-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of persistent abdominal pain and nausea for the past six months. The patient had no notable medical history or family history of any significant diseases. She has never been a smoker and maintains a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise.  Upon physical examination, the patient appeared slightly jaundiced, with a palpable hepatomegaly measuring approximately 3 cm below the costal margin. Additionally, there was evidence of splenomegaly measuring about 5 cm below the left costal margin. Gastrointestinal examination revealed mild tenderness upon deep palpation in both upper quadrants.  Laboratory results indicated certain abnormalities that warranted further investigation. The initial blood analysis showed normal glucose levels (92 mg/dl) and normal renal function (creatinine: 0.8 mg/dl). However, liver function tests revealed elevated liver enzymes; AST at 98 U/L, ALT at 87 U/L, ALP at 132 U/L, and GGT at an alarming level of 405 U/L were indicative of hepatocellular injury.  Furthermore, other laboratory findings showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at150 U/L along with increased total bilirubin tallying to approximately10 mg/dl predominantly due to conjugated bilirubin being above average; measuring nearly6.5 mg/dl – suggestive of possible obstructive jaundice.  Since these abnormalities were concerning for either hepatic pathology or biliary obstruction causing her symptoms along with her clinical presentation including jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly raised suspicions regarding malignancies such as pancreatic or biliary tract carcinoma.  Further investigations were carried out which included imaging studies like ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography scans (CT scans), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Alongside this paracentesis may be performed to examine the nature of any abdominal fluid.  Imaging findings from an abdominal ultrasound revealed dilatation in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts with a normal-appearing gallbladder. However, no apparent masses or cystic lesions were detected. These ultrasonographic findings, combined with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, raised concerns for possible biliary obstruction.  Subsequently, a CT scan was conducted to assess further details. The CT scan showed thickening of the common bile duct (CBD) walls along with periductal infiltrative soft tissue density suggestive of malignancy. No distant metastasis was identified on this imaging study.  To confirm this diagnosis, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure was performed as it could not only help diagnose but also serve as a therapeutic modality for relief of biliary obstruction if necessary. During ERCP images revealed upstream biliary dilatation caused by external compression at the level of CBD ampulla consistent with extrinsic malignant compression compatible with pancreatic adenocarcinoma affecting distal CBD and obstructing normal flow tract leading to high GGT levels in liver function test results.  The patient's case was discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting involving surgical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists and pathologists. A unanimous decision was made to proceed with surgical resection after addressing her overall fitness taking into consideration her age and general health condition for any potential curative intent based on staging investigations that are yet to be done following up postoperatively will be chemotherapy regime if needed aimed at providing palliative care when surgery is no longer considered feasible due metastasis progression or local infiltration prohibiting successful complete resection positively impacting life quality thereby extending survival rates postinitiation chemotherapy treatment plan lengths are variable & depend on individual patient's prognosis factors.  In conclusion, our case demonstrates a 55-year-old female patient with abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Initial laboratory findings showed elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggestive of hepatocellular injury and obstructive jaundice. Imaging studies revealed biliary obstruction due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma affecting the distal common bile duct (CBD). Further staging investigations are required before determining any surgical intervention or proceeding with a palliative chemotherapy regime for this patient's management.",create
"The chest pain was localized to the middle of the chest and was aggravated on exertion. He was a businessman by profession with no history of smoking, alcoholism, or any other substance abuse. Also, there was no history of any contact of TB or COVID-19 in the family or close contacts. And there was no history of foreign travel in the recent past. But he had reported having traveled by a domestic airline about twenty days back. There was no history of weight loss or any other major illness in the past.  On examination his vitals were-pulse-108/minute, arterial BP-130/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, Sp02-899% on room air, temperature- 101-degree centigrade. His Sp02 fell by 70% on room air after waking. On auscultation, there was crepitation on the bilateral middle lobes of the lungs. Also, dyspnea on exertion was noted. The rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits.  Considering this as a probable case of TB with COVID-19 he was advised a chest radiograph with sputum microscopy (Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli), Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) of the sputum and other routine investigations. To check for the COVID-19 he was advised qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from the oropharyngeal swab. The results were surprising with Mycobacterium tuberculosis detected on sputum fluorescent microscopy and were also confirmed by the CBNAAT. However, there was no resistance to Rifampicin. The results of the PCR were positive for RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the chest radiograph PA-view was suggestive of bilateral consolidations on the middle lobes of lungs with ill-defined borders. The other investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count (1x 10 9 /L) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (57 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (580 U/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm in the 1 st hour). Also, a sample for liquid culture (MGIT BACTEC) was sent to the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) which revealed the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was established by other cheaper and faster methods and also the patient was unwilling for the same. All the other routine investigations were within normal limits.  He was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center, where he was managed as per national guidelines. Besides, he was also started on an antitubercular treatment of four drugs as per the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines. He was advised follow-up post completion of his stay at the designated COVID-19 center, but he has not yet reported back for follow-up. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for using clinical data and images for publication in this study.",human
"At the vaginal examination, there was a vaginal cup instead of the introitus, with the perception of a painful pelvic mass across in favor of hematometrocolpos. Ultrasonography showed a normal-sized uterus with the presence of normal ovaries, tubes, cervix and a fluid retention at the emptiness line of the uterus continuing into the upper third segment of the vagina in relation with a hematometrocolpos and an absence of the lower third segment of the vagina. Pelvic MRI showed an anteverted uterus of 91 mm in height, 49 mm in thickness and 55 mm in width, with fluid retention at the emptiness line of the uterus continuing into the vaginal cavity. It measured 43 mm height, 21 mm wide and 17 mm deep and was probably in favor of a hematometrocolpos. The junctional zone was thickened to 12 mm and the myometrium was homogeneous, with presence of normal tubes and ovaries. The cervix was dilated by the retained fluid but had normal morphology and 44 mm of length. The lower third segment of the vagina was not seen on the MRI. Hormonal analyzes were within normal limits and her karyotype showed 46XX. The diagnosis of congenital vaginal agenesis on functional uterus was retained. Prior to the operation, she received an informed consultation on the prognosis of her fertility.   A verbal and written consent for the procedure was collected from her legal guardian. The patient underwent then a perineal vaginoplasty. The technique used consisted of vaginal traction of the upper two-thirds of the normally formed vagina followed by subcutaneous fixation, thus forming a neo-introitus. We began with a transverse incision of the vaginal cup. We dissected the fibrous masking material until the normal vagina was reached. At this point the collected blood was drained. The introduction of the hysterometer allowed us to check the uterine emptiness and the normal length of its bottom. The normal vaginal mucosa was then drawn and attached to the subcutaneous border by single points spaced by 5 mm each in a radial disposition. The new introitus obtained was kept open by silicone vaginal probes lubricated with estrogen gel until re-epithelialization occurred. Blood loss was quantified at 150 ml. The operating time was 114 minutes.  The cicatrisation was completed in 4 weeks. The evolution was marked by the appearance of regular cycles with marked improvement of pelvic pain. The nine-year retreat allowed us to review a 23-year-old married woman with a newborn baby boy and a fully satisfied sex life. Consent for publication: written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.

"The differential diagnosis included pneumonia, heart failure and COVID-19. The chest radiograph revealed para-hilar opacities and enlarged cardiac silhouette. Chest Computed tomography showed ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, diffuse and nonspecific disturbances of ventricular repolarization. Laboratory-based tests conducted upon admission revealed the following: hemoglobin level was normal (15.5 g/dL), as well as platelets (296,000/mm 3), unchanged coagulation; Inflammation syndrome was evident: white cell count was 21390/mm 3 elevated CRP hs (341 mg/L). Blood and urine cultures were all negative. There were increases in lactate dehydrogenase (425 UI/l), ferritin (594 ng/ml) and D-dimer levels (1415 ng/ml). In addition, the patient showed deranged liver and renal function. Markers of myocardial injury included elevated troponin I (Trop I) (111 ng/ml), and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) (1400 pg/ mL). Laboratory data are summarized in Table 1. Two nasopharyngeal swab were taken, one day apart and were negative for COVID-19. We still suspected the COVID-19 as he had many clinical, biological and radiological arguments. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed an enlarged left ventricle (61 mm), segmental myocardial hypokinesis along with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (30%) and elevated left ventricular pressures. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive atherosclerosis lesions in the coronary artery. Most of the etiologic analyses for this dilated cardiomyopathy remained negative. ELISA tests demonstrated a recent CMV infection (IgG negative, IgM positive) (Table 1). An extensive biological screening was performed to identify another potential cause of acute hepatitis: total IgG was negative. We ruled out drug induced and autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis and 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Abdominal ultrasonography showed normal liver characteristics with no biliary tract dilatation. Cardiac MR-scan was performed Day 6. Delayed enhancement sequences demonstrated subepicardial enhancement in the lateral free-wall of the left ventricle. The diagnosis of CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis was made on the basis of the acute clinical presentation and serologic evidence of infection. His hepatitis and pulmonary lesions were probably due to this primary CMV infection. The cardiogenic shock and the congestive heart failure were treated with intravenous inotropic agents and diuretic; without the need of an anti-viral medication. Two days later, the patient showed clinical improvement. We started supportive medication that included oral administration of 5 mg of ramipril, 2.5 mg of bisoprolol, 40 mg of furosemide twice a day, and 25 mg of spironolactone once a day. During the next week, the patient made steady progress, his liver enzyme levels and infection-related markers decreased (Table 1). After 13 days of hospitalization, the electrocardiogram, chest CT and echocardiography had become normal. He was discharged under bisoprolol 2.5 mg and ramipril 5 mg per day. The patient remained asymptomatic with no further episodes of breathlessness at two-week follow-up.",human
"An assessment of failute to trive (FTT) with acyanotic heart disease and right bronchopnemonia (treated) was made. An echocardiography was made with a diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) and patient was scheduled for surgery for VSD closure and PDA ligation. Other investigations FBC, serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine were all within normal ranges. An American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade of 2 was made and patient prepared for surgery the next day. She was fasted from 12 midnight for solid foods and allowed for breast feeding till 3:00 am. A peripheral line of 24G was secured the morning of the surgery. In the theatre, standard monitoring (electrocardiogram and pulse oximeter) was attached. The patient was sedated with ketamine 5mg and midazolam 0.5mg and manual ventilation started with 100% oxygen. An arterial line was inserted in the right radial artery with 24G canula for invasive blood pressure monitoring. The child was then intubated with 4.5 uncuffed tube facilitated by vecuronium 0.5mg and mechanically ventilation was started at tidal volume of 50mls/breath and respiratory rate adjusted to between 28-30 cycles/minutes. Intermittent fentanyl was used for analgesia as per requirement and isoflurane used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Central venous cannulation was inserted on the right internal jugular with triple lumen 4.5Fr. Surgery for VSD repair and PDA ligation started as per scheduled. After full heparinisation, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was commenced, which lasted for 55mins. Total aortic cross clamp time was 55 minutes patient was successfully weaned off from CPB. ECG waveform was in normal sinus rhythm but invasive radial artery blood pressure monitoring showed dampened waveform. On palpation, normovolumic carotid artery pulsations on both sides were present equally. Proximal aortic arch palpation by surgeon was also normal. Protamine was given to reverse the effect of heparin. After chest closure, other arterial pulses were checked (left radial, femoral and dorsalis pedis) and revealed no pulsation. The peripheral extremities were also cold. The chest was immediately reopened after sternotomy. Inspection of the distal aortic arch by the surgeon revealed Interrupted aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery and PDA was supplying to both upper and lower limb. The patient was again placed on bypass and DHCA commenced gradually to a target of 16°C. Ice packs were also placed on the head of the patient. It took 20 minutes to achieve DHCA at 16°C and this (DHCA) lasted for 33 minutes while the subclavian artery was attached to the ascending aorta and descending aorta. The temperature was now gradually brought up to 35.7°C over 22 minutes. Heparin was reversed by Protamine. Adrenaline infusion (1.5mg/50mls) was started at 0.5mls/hour. Milrinone infusion (10mg/50mls) was started at 0.3mls/hr) and sildenafril (0.5mg/ml) started at 1.4mls/hr. Fresh frozen plasma and whole blood were transfused into the patient. Vital signs at end of surgery were BP- 79/37, HR-134, sp0 2 -100%, temperature at 35.2. Second surgery lasted 3 hours 10 minutes. At the end of the surgery in the theatre. The patient was transferred to ICU following surgery with endotracheal tube Insitu. In the ICU, combination of fentanyl and midazolam infusion were added to the drugs the patient was already on and stopped after 5 hours in the ICU. The Child was found to be have poor urine output and was placed on continuous furosemide infusion (20mg/20mls at 0.5 mls/hour. Intravenous paracetamol 75mg 8 hourly, pantoprazole 5mg 12 hourly, methyl prednisolone 50mg 12 hourly. The child was mechanically ventilated through the night. On 1 Day Post Operation (1DPO), meropenem was started for the child. Also, albumin was given because of low albumin. Milrinone was stopped and levosimendan (125mg/ml) commenced at 0.25mls/hr on 2DPO. Mgso4 and potasium chloride infusion were also given over some hours to correct hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. The patient continued to be mechanically ventilated in ICU. On day 3 post OP, amino acid was commenced (astymin). Vital sign maintained on average of 75/55mmhg, sp0 2 100%, TDV 62mls, PEWEP 5, RR 30(still mechanically ventilated). Dexmedetomidine was commenced at 0.2mls/hour. Extubation of the child was done later in the afternoon and patient remained hemodynamically stable on intravenous fluid 4L/min of oxygen. Echocardiography done on the 4 day post op showed an expected performance of the heart. Oral rehydration salt (ORS) was commenced for the child. Sildenafil was commenced orally at 6.25mg 6 hourly at the same day. Aldactone was also commenced orally at 6.25mg 12 hourly 5 day post saw the commencement of oral feeds with adrenaline infusion tapered down and stopped. levosimendan and dexmedetomidine infusion were continued. IVF 5mls/hour was continued. There were also intravenous meronem, paracetamol, pantocid, furosemide, tabs sildenafil and aldactone. Arterial line was removed. On 6DPO, levosimendan and dexmedetomidine infusion were stopped. Potassium containing oral feeds was introduced. Chest X-ray revealed left lung collapse and improvised intermittent CPAP with oxygen over water was commenced with ongoing chest physiotherapy. 8DPO saw the removal of NG tube and central line. On 9DPO, Meronem, PCM and IV furosemide were stopped while tabs furosemide, oral paracetamol and oral cefuroxime were started. Oral Antimalaria (ACT) was also started. On 11DPO, the Child was discharged home conscious, alert, active and recuperating well and post operative visit scheduled for 4 weeks.",human
"No more intra or postoperative complications were recorded, and the patient was discharged on the 5 th postoperative day after antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam, completely asymptomatic. In a follow-up appointment, 1 month after surgery, the patient reported new onset of abdominal pain, at the upper right quadrant, with progressive worsening. Upon observation, he was sweaty, with pain at the superficial and deep palpation of the right hypochondrium. For that reason, he was referred to the emergency room. Due to the recent history of surgery, it was decided to perform laboratory and imaging investigation. The blood work showed leukocytosis without neutrophilia and elevated PCR. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed: “in the right hypochondrium, at the transverse and internal oblique muscles, a marked thickening with 69x31x26 mm, with a poorly defined margin and with densification of the surrounding fat, and an image of hyper-attenuation with 9mm”. An ultrasound was made to clarify these findings: “a pericentrimetric calcification is observed in the abdominal wall, about 6 cm deep from the cutaneous surface, with adjacent pseudonodular densification”. These findings were compatible with a migrated stone and small surrounding collection. The patient was discharged with the indication for antibiotics therapy (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) and analgesia. The complaints disappeared and it was decided to keep an expectant attitude. The patient maintained regular follow-up and reported intermittent pain in the referred region but not disabling. For that reason, elective removal of the gallstone was proposed. Before elective surgery, he returned to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain associated with fever and an upper right abdominal tumefaction. Abdominal exam showed a hard, painful mass with inflammatory signs on the right hypochondrium. Laboratory work revealed leukocytosis without neutrophilia and a new ultrasound and CT scan showed thickening of the abdominal wall, that echographically translated a hypoechoic formation of 6x5 cm and may correspond to an abscess and/or phlegm with possible liquefaction. Also, a prominent external anterior parietal thickening measuring 8x6 cm, with two deep calcifications of 10 and 8 mm, one most likely a chondral alteration and the other a possible gallstone”. An abscess of the abdominal wall due to a foreign body (gallstone) was diagnosed. The patient completed one week of antibiotics and underwent surgery, under general anesthesia. At that time, there was no evidence of abscess on the abdominal wall and a foreign body granuloma was found occupying the entire abdominal wall, with a pigmented gallstone in pre-peritoneal position. So, extraction of the gallstone and the respective foreign body granuloma was performed, which was later confirmed through histopathological examination. Post-operative period was without complications, with progressive improvement of symptoms. The patient was followed for a year, remaining asymptomatic throughout this entire period, without other manifestations due to lost gallstones.",human
"At Parotid MRI, the lesions straddled between the superficial and deep lobe of the right parotid, oval 20/15mm. It shows a nodule with low intensity T1 signal, and increased T2 signal, enhanced after Gadolinium administration, with presence of multiple homolateral, right jugulodigastric adenopathies. Its characteristics were suspicious of malignancy. The rest of the biological evaluation was normal. Chest x-rays showed no evidence of a possible chest location. The diagnosis of parotid cancer has been strongly suspected. To obtain histological evidence, we decided to perform a partial exofacial parotidectomy with dissection and preservation of the facial nerve. Anatomopathological examination of the resected mass concluded a primary parotid and cervical lymph node tuberculosis. This was confirmed by definitive histological examination. The patient was put on anti-bacillary treatment (2RHZ/4RH) for six months, with significant improvement 6 months after the end of treatment. Observation 2 : a 45-year-old woman, with no notable pathological history, consulted in our facility for a left sub-angulo-mandibular mass evolving for approximately 4 months. There were slight inflammatory signs nearby, particularly a slight redness with pain and fever at 38°C without weight loss, chewing discomfort, trismus, or pus exit at salivary orifices. The young woman was in good general condition and had a swelling of the left parotid area, firm, painless, measuring about 4 cm in long axis, and fixed. There was no limitation of the mouth opening or peripheral facial paralysis. Examination of the oral cavity and the opening of the stenon canal did not reveal any inflammation or pus output. Examination of the cervical lymph node areas was normal. The rest of the ENT and general examination was without any particularity. A cervical ultrasound was done to show a tumor lesion, measuring 29 x 28 x 14 mm, of mixed echostructure with central liquid predominance at the lower pole of the left parotid. Parotid MRI showed a lesional process in the deep compartment of the left parotid gland, with low intensity T1 signal, and in the other hand, high intensity signal in diffusion sequence with peripheral enhancement, measuring 30 x 29 x 15 mm. The right parotid and submandibular glands, in addition to the thyroid are without signal or morphological abnormalities. This was in favor of a left parotid abscess. The rest of the biological test, as well as the chest x-ray, were normal. The patient was operated benefiting conservative parotidectomy of the facial nerve. Histopathological study of the cyst wall found epithelial-gigantocellular granuloma with caseous necrosis. The culture of the puncture fluid on Lowenstein-Jensen medium revealed an acid-resistant bacillus, which allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of primary tuberculosis of the parotid gland. The young woman received a medical treatment of antituberculosis drugs combining an initial phase of 2 months based on rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, followed by a consolidation phase of 4 months combining Rifampicin and Isoniazid. The evolution was favourable within 9 months after the end of the treatment.",human
"At 13 months of age, he had an episode of fever. After 24 hours, he experienced convulsions and was referred to a tertiary care centre by a local practitioner. He was admitted to PICU for 15 days with a high-grade fever of 106 degrees F and refractory status epilepticus. He was afebrile after day 3 of admission, and seizures continued till day 6. At the time of discharge, he had a frequency of 10 seizure episodes per day. He had neuroregression in all domains of development. He was unable to hold neck or roll, unable to speak, and unresponsive to any visual stimulus. He was discharged with anti-epileptic medications and a home exercise program. On evaluation, his Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was at level IV, and Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) score was 5. He had generalized hypotonia, preferred W-sitting, had tightness of bilateral hamstrings and calf muscles, displayed body rocking and chewed the clothes. Child neither made eye contact nor, was there visual fixation and tracking. His light perception was equivocal. Figure 1 and Table 1 shows the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings of the brain and the timeline of the events, respectively. Diagnostic assessment: GMFCS and PBS were used to measure gross motor function and balance, respectively. Diagnostic challenges: visual and cognitive impairment posed challenges. Furthermore, the child continued to have seizures 3-4 times per day. Physiotherapy intervention: the patient received regular physiotherapy based on the principles of neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) and sensory integration (SI). The initial phase of 3 months included sustained stretching of the bilateral calf and hamstring muscles in functional positions, using unstable surfaces (equilibrium board and swiss ball) to challenge his sitting balance, using swing system to impart vestibular input, using visual stimulus to initiate a response, facilitating transitions like supine to sit and sit to stand by appropriate therapist's hand placement, providing proprioceptive stimulus by bouncing on a trampoline with support, weight-bearing exercises, joint compressions and use of a chewy tube. As the child regained the ability to sit and stand without support, walker (rollator) was used as a walking aid. The parents were educated about the home exercise program.  During the follow-up visits interspersed over 2 years, the patient was reassessed and the exercise plan was modified accordingly. The child started taking a few steps without support.  In the second phase of regular physiotherapy for 6 months by a physiotherapist, the goal was to achieve unsupported walking under supervision in the view of visual impairment. Sessions included standing on equilibrium board and stability disc with just as much support as required. Walking on compliant surfaces, ramp, uneven terrain and across obstacle course was practiced. Negotiating stairs holding onto the railing with moderate assistance was included. Proprioceptive, vestibular and visual inputs were continued to be given. Outcomes: after the course of physiotherapy, the child was able to sit and stand without support. He was able to walk without support on uneven surfaces under standby supervision. He started responding to light. He seemed to be avoiding bumping into objects or persons by apparently improved visual ability. Body rocking and chewing on clothes were seldom observed. Improvement in functional activities led to an increase in the participation of the child in social gatherings. Figure 2 shows the functional abilities of the child at the age of 5 years and 8 years, respectively.",human
"Delivery was by vaginal route with cephalic presentation, and adaptation to extra-uterine life was normal with Apgar scores of 8, 10 and 10 respectively at the 1 st, 5 th, and 10 th minutes. Meconium and urine were not emitted immediately after birth. On physical exam, the baby's hue was normal, the limbs were quadriflexed and reactive. The vital parameters were normal as follows: temperature (T°) = 36.5°C; breathing rate (BR) = 58 Cycle per minutes; the heart rate (HR) = 148 Beats per minute; blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) = 98%. Anthropometric parameters were height = 47cm; head circumference = 35cm; the weight = 2965kg. The conjunctivae and sclera were normal, no facial dysmorphy was noted, and the nasal catheter testing for choanal atresia was negative. The cardio-pulmonary exam was normal. The abdomen was slightly distended, asymetric, with a batrachian-like spread out. The abdominal wall seemed crumpled, especially on the left flank. The intestines could be felt beneath the abdominal skin. The umbilical stump was fresh and normally vascularized. The osteo-articular exam was without peculiarities, with an upper segment height = 26cm, while that of the lower segment was = 21cm. The external genitalia were masculine, but the scrotum was empty, due to undescended testes. There was no sexual differentiation anomaly; the anus was present and permeable. The minimal neurological exam was normal with primitive reflexes, axial and peripheral tonus that were normal. The paraclinical exams done comprised an abdominal ultrasound which showed features in favor of aplasia of the left antero-lateral abdominal muscles, the kidneys had normal topography, sizes (left kidney = 47mm; right kidney = 48mm), and were well-differentiated. There was however, dilatation of the ureters and pyelocaliectasis, characterizing hydro ureteronephrosis. The kidney function was altered with blood urea = 2.19 g/l, creatinine = 33.0mg/l and a creatinine clearance of 5.88ml/min. The first micturition occurred 50 hours after birth. The mother's kidney function was rather normal. Further complementary exams such as cardiac and trans-fontanellar doppler ultrasounds, rachis and thoraco-abdominal radiography, as well as abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT)-scan in search of other malformations could not be done because of financial limitations. The management consisted in the maintenance of a balanced hydroelectrolytic state, adequate postures, enteral feeding through a nasogatric tube, given the difficulty to put the baby onto the breast, and delayed digestion. The surgical management would have consisted in a sequential intervention comprising: orchidopexy, urinary tract reconstruction and abdominoplasty respectively. However, these could not be practiced in due time, because of renal failure and limited financial resources. The neonate died after 7 days of life.",human
"Reflexes were exaggerated on lower limbs. Local examination of the spine could find tenderness in the right paravertebral area on T12-L1 level, related to a subcutaneous fixed mass.  Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine were performed. Findings were compatible with multiple metastases, and involved:. The posterior part of the vertebral body of T5, with posterior wall rupture; the posterior elements of T12 and L1 vertebras, with a tissular mass causing bone lysis, severe cord compression and extending to the paravertebral region; the vertebral body was intact. Vertebral body of S1, withlysis, right spinal canal invasion and extension to the pre-vertebral area These lesions were iso-to hypo-intense to bone on T1 weighted images, and heterogeneous on T2 weighted images with multiple hyperintense foci. Contrast enhancement was intense and also heterogeneous, and was extending vertically along the epidural space of the medial lesion. On CT scan, bone lysis was observed.  Computed tomography of brain, cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvian regions, and also systemic investigations were all negative for a primary tumoral lesion.  The patient was proposed for a posterior decompression on T12-L1 level with instrumented fixation -as symptoms were mainly related to it-and also a sacral decompression.  In the dorsolumbar area, the tumor was immediately found under the subcutaneous tissue, invading the paravertebral muscles: A multi-lobulated firm mass, with a white-reddish appearance, mainly avascular. The tumor was not encapsulated but could easily be differentiated and separated from thesurrounding tissue. The bone lysis was evident, and the spinal cord compression severe. The dura matter was not infiltrated. Dural decompression was completed and T11-L2 screw fixation was performed - given the pedicle lysis on CT-scans - after gross total removal was achieved. Taking advantage of the patient’s position, and given the history of lombosacral radiculopathy, an S1 right hemilaminectomy with curettage of the sacral body and radicular decompression were also performed. Operative findings were compatible with the upper level.  Histology specimens were analyzed for both localizations, with an identical result: a malignant spindle cell proliferation with large necrotic areas. Tumor cells were arranged into short fascicles and interlacing bundles. The nuclei were hyperchromatic and occasionally highly pleiomorphic. Mitotic figures were recognized in about 15 per 10 high power fields. Large necrotic areas were observed (about 50% of the tumor surface). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin and H-caldesmon, and negative for S100 protein, and CD34. Focal reactivity was observed with EMA. Thus, the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma grade 3 of the FNCLCC was established.  In the postoperative period, the patient started improving her motor score, and gaining control on her urinary function. She was discharged on both rehabilitation unit and oncology unit for adjuvant therapy.  One month after discharge, the patient presented for persistent headaches, with no focal signs. Locally, we could find tenderness on the right frontal area of the skull convexity. CT scan was performed, showing a small lytic frontal bone lesion extending to the subcutaneous tissue withoutdural extension. A small craniectomy around was performed, and the histopathology came back with no surprise.  At one year follow up, the adjuvant therapy failed to obtain tumor control. The thoracic and abdominopelvian CT scan showed both local and systemic progression. Although her motor function improved continuosly to become self dependant, her general condition was worsening. She was then assessed for palliative treatment. The patient died two years after her initial management.",human
"His pulse rate was 118 per minute, which was regular and of normal volume. Heart sounds 1 and 2 were heard on auscultation, with no murmurs. He had clear lung fields with good air entry bilaterally. There were no significant findings on abdominal examination, and he had normal external male genitalia. A facial examination showed he had a coarse facial appearance with a flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism, low set microtic ears with protruding ear lobules and a short upturned nose. He had an inter-incisal distance of about 13mm at maximal mouth opening. He had a back swelling measuring about 15cm by 25cm in the lower sacral region, which was sessile, not tender and had no differential warmth. It had an irregular surface, it was soft and had none distinct edges. The swelling had no underlying bony defect, and no pelvic extension was noted on digital rectal examination. His limbs were normal and his serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 31mcg/L (normal 0-5mcg/L). A two dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was done, which showed situs solitus of the atria and viscera, with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance. The mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary and aortic valves were normal, and chamber walls showed good contractility. There was no atrial septal defect (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) nor ventricular septal defect (VSD) seen. A thick band of echogenic tissue separating the right atrium into 2 unequal halves with a wide eccentric aperture communicating both chambers was seen. Abdomino-pelvic ultrsonography showed normal right and left kidneys. Based on his clinical features and investigation results, a diagnosis of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) and an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter was made. Genetic analysis was however not done in this patient, as we currently do not have facilities for such a test in our hospital. Due to the documented risk of malignancy in embryonic tumors in SGS [2, 3, 6], a decision for an early excision of the sacrococcygeal mass was made. At induction of anaesthesia, difficulties were encountered at attempts to pass an endotracheal tube due to the inability to open the patient’s mouth wide enough for the placement of a laryngoscope. Bilateral congenital temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis was diagnosed, and attempts at endotracheal intubation were abandoned. Since we did not have facilities for fibre optic laryngeal intubation, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted and naso-gastric intubation for gastric decompression done. The procedure of SCT excision was performed with the patient in the left lateral position; instead of the conventional prone jack-knife position. His post-operative recovery was uneventful and he was discharged to the outpatient clinic for follow up on the tenth day post operation. The histopathology report of the excised tumour showed a solid mass lined externally by unremarkable epidermis. The parenchyma demonstrated smooth and skeletal muscles, adipose tissues, cartilage and glandular tissue with no malignant foci. During his first follow up visit by the third week post operation, he was referred to the Maxillofacial surgery unit on account of his TMJ ankylosis. He was however subsequently lost to follow up.",human
"Jaundice appeared on the third day of life, followed by fever which was noticed the next day. Hyperbilirubinaemia was initially unconjugated with a total bilirubin of 120.3 μmol/L (7.1 mg/dl), with 14% conjugated fraction. The conjugated fraction increased to 21.9% within 24 hours, to 40.0% within 48 hours and had reached 67.0% by day six. The platelet count reduced gradually over the first two weeks of life to 46x10 9 /L. Haematocrit had also reduced significantly by then, necessitating blood transfusion. By day 14, the liver was palpably enlarged to three centimetres below the right costal margin and conjugated bilirubin had reached 74.7% of total, though the total serum bilirubin was not remarkably high (153.2 μmol/L). The liver enzymes were slightly elevated but clotting profile and serum proteins were normal. Initial hepatobiliary scan revealed no obvious abnormality. Tests for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Syphilis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus were all negative. Feed tolerance was initially poor, with consequent weight loss. Serum bilirubin continued to rise all through the first month of life, eventually reaching 606.1 μmol/L (35.7 mg/dl). A repeat ultrasound done to exclude biliary atresia showed normal liver echogenicity with normal intra-hepatic ducts and vessels; the gallbladder was normal in size but its wall was thickened, hence cholecystitis was suggested. There were no sonographic features of biliary atresia. The liver function parameters continued to worsen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) rose to 1,627 IU/L. Hepatitis was considered, but its cause could not be ascertained. Reducing sugars were absent in the urine; alpha-1 antitrypsin assay was also requested but could not be done. Alkaline phosphatase continued to rise and eventually reached a peak of 3,090 IU/L. Other liver enzymes also remained above reference values. Baby had however started tolerating feeds and gaining weight. A repeat abdominal ultrasound revealed a contracted, poorly visualized gallbladder, and the triangular cord sign of biliary atresia could not be distinctively excluded. This heightened the suspicion of biliary atresia, and urgent surgical intervention was considered. Another scan however excluded biliary atresia. Screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was then considered, which came out to be strongly positive with CMV IgM titre of 28.24 (Reference value 0.0 - 0.8). The mother also had serological evidence of CMV infection. The baby was given intravenous Ganciclovir for three weeks, followed by oral valganciclovir for another three weeks. Frequent intravenous cannulation was required during intravenous therapy due to Ganciclovir-induced phlebitis. Weekly monitoring of the full blood count was done during treatment, which revealed a decline in the neutrophil count, though there was no neutropaenia. Liver function parameters consistently improved during and after therapy, and had normalized by age 12 months. No obvious neurologic abnormality was documented throughout the period of treatment and the child's developmental milestones have been within normal limits up till the age of 15 months when the child was last seen. Hearing test done by otoacoustic emission testing was normal in both ears, and visual test was also normal.",human
"However, she complained of abdominal pain and intermittent uterine contractions. She was commenced on oral nifedipine for tocolysis. Her laboratory test confirmed COVID-19 infection after 48 hours and she was referred to LUTH immediately. Although LUTH has assigned wards for the management of patients with COVID-19, there were no dedicated spaces for infected pregnant women and their neonates. However, there was a dedicated operating theatre with a safe corridor to one of the COVID-19 isolation wards. The woman was admitted in a private room at the isolation ward prior to the caesarean section. A multidisciplinary team of obstetricians, anaesthetists, neonatologists, nurses, psychiatrists and infectious disease experts were assembled and simulation sessions were undertaken based on the established infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. All staff caring for the woman wore appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Her laboratory results were unremarkable except for lymphopenia (a common laboratory finding in patients with COVID-19) [6, 9] and hypokalaemia. The correction of hypokalaemia was commenced with parenteral potassium infusion. She was appropriately counselled and reassured to calm her perioperative anxiety. A remote consent was taken via video call, after sharing appropriate information material via WhatsApp messaging.  On admission day 2, she was transported to the operating theatre while observing all the necessary IPC measures. After signing a written informed consent, she had a lower segment caesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation performed under spinal anaesthesia. She was delivered of a full-term male baby weighing 2600g with Apgar score 9 and 10 in 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Intraoperative oxygen saturation was maintained at a minimum of 98%, intraoperative infusion volume was 1000mL and estimated blood loss was 600mL. She had prophylactic intravenous tranexamic acid 1g and carbetocin 100μg. The mother and baby were nursed in the recovery room of the operating theatre and the immediate postnatal period was uneventful. The newborn was commenced on breast milk substitute until the mother was able to breastfeed the baby on demand. On day 3 after delivery, the mother and her newborn were transferred back to the isolation ward. The nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the neonate (at birth and 48 hours after birth) were all negative for COVID-19 infection. Both mother and baby remained asymptomatic during the postpartum period. On day 15 after delivery, the mother met the criteria for discharge because she had remained asymptomatic for more than 14 days after her initial positive result [4]. After appropriate counselling, the mother and her baby were discharged home and scheduled for a follow-up visit in 2 weeks. Throughout the period of care, contact between staff and patient was minimised and she wore a surgical mask all the time. Telephone conversations were frequently used for communication between the woman and the multi-disciplinary team members (obstetrician, anaesthetist, neonatologist and psychiatrist). Fourteen days after the delivery, all her caregivers remained well.",human
"She reported a history that her mother and elder sister passed on due to a similar illness but for the elder sister, she died when she was 25 years old having been diagnosed with an advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon at one of the Hospitals in Northern Uganda. Her mother too died due to a similar condition but at the time of her death she was middle aged. She denies any history of smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol in her entire life but reports that they normally used firewood for cooking since childhood.  She had moved to several health facilities in Gulu seeking medical treatment and she was being treated for Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) for which she only got mild relieve from the pain and discomfort. At the time of her admission she had a booklet of medical forms which when combined together could be measured at about 10cm in thickness. In all, the clinicians continued to diagnose and treat her with Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) and continued to prescribe antacids and other proton pump inhibitors for her treatment. The mass was even biopsied under ultrasound guided biopsy in one of the major Hospitals in the region for which the histology results showed a non-specific inflammation.  On general examination, she was a young woman in fair general condition, moderately wasted, afebrile to touch with an axillary temperature of 36 0 C. She had moderate pallor but not jaundiced, she had moderate dehydration, but with no palpable lymphadenopathy.  The abdomen was of normal fullness, moving with respiration. It was soft with mild tenderness in the right hypochondrial and lumbar regions. The Liver and spleen were not enlarged but there was an ill-defined mass which was palpable in the right hypochondrial and lumbar regions, which was firm in consistency, nodular, non-tender, relatively mobile, intra-abdominal and with a dull percussion note. There were no other masses palpable and no collateral findings on the abdominal wall. There was no renal or suprapubic tenderness and the spleen and the liver were not enlarged. There were normal findings in both the vaginal and rectal examinations with normal anal tone and the rectum was full with faecal matter. The stool on the examination finger was mucoid stained and smelled like rotten meat. A barium enema was requested but was not done due to socio-economic reasons. A complete blood picture revealed a hypochromic microcytic anaemia. The other laboratory results such as the Liver function parameters (serum albumin, serum bilirubin, AST, ALT and other enzymes) and Renal function parameters (serum electrolytes [K+, Na+, Cl-, -HC0 3], serum creatinine, blood urea and nitrogen levels) were all within normal ranges (Table 2). The Abdominal ultrasound showed an ill-defined mass in the right hypochondrial region which was heterogeneous with a central echogenicity approximately 7.2cm wide and with no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or ascitis. Ultrasound guided biopsy was conducted but was not conclusive. The histological finding showed a fibro-fatty tissue with chronic inflammation containing some eosinophils. These findings created more dilemma and frustration among the family members that they requested that the patient be transferred to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital for further management.  On the day of admission to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, she was reviewed by a senior surgeon who took note of the nature of the mass and the positive familial history of carcinoma of the colon and recommended the patient for an exploratory laparotomy since she could not meet most of the costs of investigations requested. The patient was successfully managed surgically at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital main operating theatre. At the Laparotomy, they found a nodular, firm, mobile mass in the hepatic flexure extending 3cm into the transverse colon and 4cm down into the ascending colon not fixed to the posterior wall. A right hemicolectomy was conducted and an end to side anastomosis was performed between the distal ileum and the mid third of the transverse colon. Macroscopically, there was a colonic tumour mass resected was clinically Duke's B classification and there was no gross evidence of mesenteric or mesocolonic lymphadenopathy or ascitis. The liver surface was smooth with no gross evidence of any metastatic sites. The abdomen was then closed in layers. The abdominal stitches were removed in the 10 th postoperative day when the wound had healed completely.  Gross examination of the resected tumour observed a firm, nodular, annular, fungating, necrotic tumour of the hepatic flexure of the colon measuring 7.0cm in the longest diameter and had not spread beyond the serosa of the colon. Histology of the biopsy taken showed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon of mucinous type and the margin of the resected transverse colon and the distal ileum were histologically tumour free.  The patient did very well postoperatively and was discharged on the 6 th postoperative day. She returned to the SOPD on the 10 th postoperative day for removal of stitches. She was advised to continue to attend SOPD and also make an effort to visit the Uganda Cancer Institute for further expert advice and treatment from an oncologist.  Three weeks later the patient was reexamined and a thorough evaluation of the physical and clinical parameters for any abnormalities was conducted. All parameters were still within their normal ranges.  A review of the cancer registry at Lacor Hospital showed that there have been four female patients dignosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon for the period 2013-2015 but all were above 40 years of age (Table 3).",human
"The patient was diagnosed with CML. She received a chemotherapy protocol made of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea and a treatment based on imatinib at the dose of 400mg per day. Patient achieved complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. The patient was readmitted into our pediatric department with complains of severe headache, vomiting, pain and bilateral visual loss since three days. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared pale. Blood pressure was 100/60mm/hg and the heart rate 98 beat/minute. There was no lymphadenopathy and the nervous system examination was normal. Intraocular muscle testing was normal; however, there was an exophthalmia in both eyes. The pupil was sluggish to react to light. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral stade III disc edema and hemorrhages of the retina. She underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan with the suspicion of leukemic involvement or any other intracranial event (cerebral edema); however, nothing was found. A subsequent bone marrow exam showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative. The patient had no other known pathology that could be held responsible for retina edema. We suggested that it was a side effect of imatinib so its administration was temporary interrupted. The patient was put on an anti-edema therapy (mannitol, dexamethasone). However, few months later, the patient presented in the emergency room with a headache and severe vomiting. She described a recurrence of the same character of headaches accompanied with weakness of extremities and seizures. Nervous system examination revealed neck rigidity, presence of meningeal signs and lower limb paraplegia. CT of the brain revealed subdural chronic hematoma and a serpenginous gyriform enhancement around the contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of the CSF collected showed lymphoblasts in a WBC count of 11000cells/ml. Flow cytometry of the CSF showed that blast cells were positive for a cluster of differentiation markers (CD) (CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22 and partially positive for CD45) confirming CNS extramedullary lymphoid blast infiltration. A bone marrow aspiration was done to evaluate the status of her chronic myelogenous leukemia and result was consistent with a chronic phase. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy.  The diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crises (lymphoid type) was based on the presence of blasts in CSF (confirmed by flow cytometry).  The patient received a high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, arabinoside and dexamethasone). The imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg per day. She was treated with 24 Gy of whole-brain radiation therapy.  Allogenic stem cell transplantation was not feasible. We noticed a rapidly progressive amelioration in her neurological status after finishing systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy; however, the patient's visual loss showed no signs of improvement.",human
"The patient returned home after an uneventful recovery to be followed up locally. She maintained satisfactory saturations and fairly adequate exercise tolerance throughout childhood. She underwent phlebotomy on three occasions on account of hyperviscosity. Although counselled about the risks of pregnancy, she was insistent on having a child. At age 32 years, she became pregnant but miscarried in the first trimester. One year later, she presented to our clinic with a seven week pregnancy. At the time of the pregnancy, she was not on any medication and had only mild effort intolerance (NYHA II). The oxygen saturations ranged between 86%-89%. Her blood pressure was 101/69mmHg with a pulse rate of 86 per minute. Her hemoglobin was 18.3g/dl (hematocrit of 54.9%). The transthoracic echocardiography was in keeping with her intraoperative findings in childhood: usual veno-atrial and atrioventricular connections, diminutive outlet portion of the right ventricle without continuity with an arterial segment, both ventricles connected to a 40mm solitary arterial trunk through a 27mm sub-arterial VSD. No intra-pericardial pulmonary artery was found. Large collateral vessels (MAPCAs) arising from the descending aorta appeared to be the source of pulmonary blood flow, with origin stenosis of the left-sided MAPCA. The ventricular function was good with ejection fraction of 76%. There were echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension. The risks of pregnancy to mother and fetus were once again emphasized and termination discussed as an option but the patient preferred to continue with the pregnancy. A multidisciplinary specialist team consisting of a cardiologist, obstetrician/gynecologist, and cardiac anesthetist as the core team members was formed to draw a management plan for the pregnancy, deliver, and puerperium. The patient, being a house wife, was advised to reduce her chores at home in keeping with her comfort. The patient tolerated the pregnancy relatively well, maintaining oxygen saturations between 84% and 88% until the 28 th week. At 28 weeks gestation, her effort tolerance worsened, her oxygen saturation dropped to 80% and the hemoglobin rose to 19.9g/dl. She was hospitalized and placed on bed rest, close surveillance, and regular fetal monitoring. She was given elastic compression stockings and anticoagulated with warfarin (target INR between 2 and 3) to counter the risk of thromboembolism. The initial pelvic scan demonstrated no obvious fetal abnormalities but subsequent scans showed signs of oligohydramnios. The findings suggested slow amniotic fluid loss. The decision was thus taken at 34 weeks to deliver the fetus. An elective Caesarean Section was performed at 34 weeks of gestation under general anesthesia. A female infant, weighing 1.2 kg was delivered with APGAR scores of 6 and 7 (first and fifth minutes). On the second postpartum day the patient developed congestive heart failure. She was treated with diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) with good response and was discharged a week later. The baby was initially nursed in the neonatal intensive care unit. Echocardiography on the baby prior to discharge showed no CHD. Post-delivery evaluation of the mother showed good ventricular function on echocardiogram. A computed tomographic angiography was performed a year after delivery to evaluate the sources of pulmonary blood flow. The ascending aorta measured 45mm with usual branching pattern. The right lung was supplied by an 18mm MAPCA from the descending aorta. The left lung was supplied by another MAPCA measuring 20mm with origin stenosis. After six years post-delivery follow up, both mother and child are doing well. The mother's effort tolerance has diminished moderately but she is still able to care for the child and perform her usual daily chores reasonably well.",human
"There was no similar case in her family and entourage. On examination, the patient had a poor general condition, a functional impotence when walking. The palpebral mucous membranes were pale and the bulbar mucous membranes anicterical. There was an infectious syndrome with a fever at 40ºC and a steady tachycardia at 100 beats/minute. Her weight was 12 kg for a height of 1 meter (body mass index at 12). The dermatological examination found a large, indurated, erythematous, warm plaques, that was mobile with respect to the deep plane, adhering to the superficial plane. The edges were clearly delineatable by the fingers, interestingly the lower limbs, the back, and the abdomen. The pubis and the vulva were also indurated. On this large plaque, there were hollow ulcers of variable size (n = 3), with polycyclic contours and fibrinous, necrotic bottom and detached edges. The peri-ulcer area wasn't pigmented. The back of the left foot was the site of lymphoedema. There was no damage to the mucous membranes and integuments. The left knee was blocked in flexion causing a functional impotence to walk. Bilateral and inflammatory inguinal lymphadenopathy were noted. The examination of the other organs was normal: no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly; the pulmonary fields were free. From this symptomatology we evoked diagnostic hypotheses of Buruli ulcer category 3 in the first time. Ziehl Nielsen staining and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium ulcerans by gene amplification of a specific genome sequence, IS2404 was negative. Direct examination of a punch biopsy sample shows yeasts and mycelial filaments. Complementary examinations included: hypochromic microcytic anemia, leukocytosis at 19.5 10 9 /L with a predominance of eosinophils at 11% or 2.15 10 9 /L (215/ mm 3). The C-reactive protein was positive at 192mg/L. Serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B infection were negative. In histopathology, the epidermis is well differentiated and discreetly orthokeratotic. The dermis is the site of significant inflammatory fibrosis. Inflammation is polymorphic with numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells associated with epithelioid granulomas and giganto-cellular granulomas. The granulomas are centered by extracellular eosinophilic masses and bulky mycelial filaments (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon), which led to basidiobolomycosis. From these results, the diagnosis of ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl was retained. The mycological culture and polymerase chain reaction to identify the germ weren't done because of technical reasons. The patient was put on ketoconazole (100 mg per day) combined with a correction of anemia using oral iron suspension of 5 mg per day and her nutrititional status by enriched porridges and a high protein diet. Transaminase assay was done at the start of the treatment and then every two weeks for monitoring. Surgical management was carried out, consisting initially of a detachment of ulcers, then secondarily a cutaneous mesh transplant to promote the healing of large ulcers. The correction of the flexum, the recovery of the extremities of limbs and walking, as well as the management of lymphoedema were carried out by the physiotherapists. Progression was favorable after 14 weeks of complete medical treatment, lymphoedema, flexum correction, and ulcer healing. There was no recidivism after 6 months and then one year of follow-up.",human
"Cranial nerve examination revealed palatal weakness with an impaired gag and cough reflex; a nasal quality in speech too was observed along with normal extra-ocular movements. Further neurological examination was consistent with normal motor, sensory and cerebellar functions. While auscultating the patient's chest, normal heart sounds were heard and scattered crepitations were appreciated over bilateral lung fields. Being a hypertensive male, as this patient had an acute presentation of symptoms and reported no diurnal variation in intensity of bulbar weakness or fatiguability, a diagnosis of MG was not initially thought of. Instead, it was diagnosed as acute ischemic stroke that seemed like a probable partial Wallenberg (medullary) syndrome. A 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with MR angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Considering a diffusion negative stroke, the patient was admitted; antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin, neurotropics, antihypertensives and statins were commenced. Nasogastric (NG) tube insertion was planned to prevent aspiration of food. Routine blood investigations, thrombophilia blood workup, a 2D echocardiogram, 24-hour holter monitoring were ordered as part of young stroke workup, all of which yielded normal results. During hospital stay, the patient had difficulty in articulation of speech, elevated blood pressures on several occasions, persistent nasal speech and also developed mild breathlessness on the third day of admission. However, breathlessness gradually reduced after treating with nebulized bronchodilators and nebulized corticosteroids, his high blood pressure was controlled with optimization of antihypertensives. Upon discharge after a week, the patient was doing better, but signs of bulbar weakness (hyponasal voice, nasal regurgitation) were persistent; thus, it was decided to continue feeding via nasogastric tube to prevent further aspiration of food. Upon review a week later, the patient initially reported having some improvements in his symptoms and this provided a false sense of assurance. During subsequent follow up consultation after a month, there was still noticeable palatal weakness and associated dysphagia. In view of persistent symptoms, a fluoroscopic evaluation of deglutition was conducted, which revealed weakness in the base of tongue and palatal muscles hindering normal deglutition. A flexible endoscopic study rendered the patient not fit for taking food orally. Thus, NG tube was kept in-situ. It is to be noted that antiplatelets and statins were being continued with good compliance. A month later, the patient presented with further worsening of symptoms, he was also noticed to have drooping of his eyelids, chewing difficulty with diurnal variation and increasing generalized fatiguability. Examination of oral cavity revealed a furrowed/fissured appearance of tongue with atrophy as well. Keeping a probability of myasthenia gravis as a differential diagnosis, a repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test and estimation of acetyl choline receptor (AchR) antibody in serum were planned immediately. Along with that, a low dose of pyridostigmine too was commenced. As anticipated, the RNS was suggestive of generalised MG, AChR antibody was strongly positive (17nmol/L, normal- < 0.4nmol/L). This was followed by the commencement of a full-fledged therapy with neostigmine (30mg), pyridostigmine (300mg) and oral prednisolone (10mg). The patient was then reviewed in two weeks after performing a computerized tomography (CECT) scan of the thorax which fortunately revealed no thymoma. He showed significant improvement in his bulbar weakness and fatiguability. The same regimen was repeated for two more months resulting in marked reduction in symptoms, weaning him off his NG tube and he finally became symptom free by the end of three months. During review in the last week of March 2020, he was asymptomatic. On examination of his tongue, which was previously fissured/furrowed and atrophied (a rare finding in AchR antibody positive MG [1]), there was notable improvement upon continuing the same line of management.",human
"Since the amputations, the patient has never worn any prosthesis. The subject has requested finger prostheses to improve the quality of life. The case was discussed and with the consent for the patient's rehabilitation of fingers, silicone prostheses was planned for the first stage of the treatment. The measurements were taken by a Certified Prosthetist. The manufacturing of the prosthesis consisted of the following steps: the impression taking, the wax pattern and the laboratory works as described in former studies [9, 10]. The case described here presented with multiple amputations of both hands which present the amputation of the distal phalange of the second finger as well. That made it difficult taking the impression on the sound finger. So, the impression was done on the contralateral finger of the patient. The impressions were taking with hydrophilic vinyl-polysiloxane impression material. The finger was in relax position while taking the pattern. Two layers of the impression material were wrapped on the fingers for about 10 minutes and the negative molds were taken off after the setting was done. Then the liquid wax was poured into the impression mold to retrieve the positive replica of the hand. Then another impression was taken from the wax mold to create the final mold in which the silicone solution was inserted. To ensure a total suspension of the prosthesis, a suspension cavity was created in the mold using a pin made with cast following technique described in the former study [10]. In order to match the patient's skin colour, the artist's oil colours were used to mix with the silicone solution. To ensure total aesthetics, the nail part was first packed then the dorsal and palmar aspects were mixed and packed separately in the mold. Due to unavailability of electric oven to heat the silicone solution, the mold was closed and heated using a kitchen gas stove for about an hour. In order to have all the surface of the cast with the average temperature, the surfaces of the cast mold were turned periodically on the stove gas. The finished prosthesis was then retrieved from the mold and excess silicone flesh was trimmed from the margins. The prostheses were tried on the patient after she was educated on how to take care of the prosthesis. Through the technique described above, good suspension and real looking finger prosthesis as patient's skin colour was manufactured. The subject was able to don the prosthesis on her own and had no pain when wearing it and was able to grab an object. The patient was satisfied with the final aspect of the prosthesis.",human
"The cardiothoracic surgeon offered open commissurotomy as percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (PBV) was not available. She declined the in view of the procedure related risks. At 20 weeks gestation she was commenced on propranolol to treat a persistent tachycardia and prophylactic warfarin. She was switched from warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at 36 weeks gestation. At 38 weeks, an echocardiogram showed an MVA of 0.9cm 2 and EF of 58%. Her functional status was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II. The estimated foetal weight (EFW) was 1950g, with normal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) flow. In order to time the required lapse period between last dose of LMWH and the epidural procedure, she had elective induction of labour. She developed foetal bradycardia 6 hours after initiating induction. An emergency caesarean section was done under general anaesthesia as the epidural catheter which had been timed for established labour had not yet been inserted. She was given frusemide and antibiotics peri-partum. A 2020g live baby was delivered. She was discharged from hospital on day 7 on warfarin and was stable when reviewed by both physician and obstetrician 14 days postpartum. She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit 4 weeks postpartum with shortness of breath, severe supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension and died 3 days later. Case 2 : mrs. B is a 28 years old who presented at 10 weeks gestation. She was known to have RHD and was on warfarin for a mechanical mitral valve. The pregnancy had been planned against advice from her gynaecologist and cardiologist. She was asymptomatic (NYHA class I). She was started on folic acid 5mg daily. Her INR was within therapeutic range. At 20 weeks, a foetal anomaly scan showed severely dilated cerebral ventricles dangling choroid plexus, lemon shaped head. The inter-hemispheric fissure was present and there was no identifiable cortical brain tissue. The facial anatomy was normal. There was a discordant growth pattern with the bi-parietal diameter corresponding to 24 weeks, head circumference to 23 weeks but abdominal circumference and femur length both to 19 weeks. A repeat scan by a radiologist showed ""evidence of a well formed cranium but with severe hydraencephaly with replacement of supratentorial brain parenchyma by cerebro-spinal fluid. There was mild preservation of posterior fossa structures with ventricles not easily describable."" In the opinion of both the sonographer and the radiologist the findings were not compatible with extra-uterine life. The couple was informed and termination of the pregnancy (TOP) was done. Her INR was 2.3. She expelled the conceptus complete within 24hrs of induction. There was no excessive bleeding and she was discharged in a stable condition. Copper T intrauterine contraceptive device (Cu-IUCD) was offered.",human
"Its origins were unclear. There was no free fluid seen on ultrasound. The patient was otherwise afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She had normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and pregnancy was negative. She was admitted to the ward on analgesia and an abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed the next day, which showed a sausage like cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the hepatic flexure of the colon with the cecum displaced and ante-flexed over the ascending colon. There were no liver lesions or lymphadenopathy noted. The length of the mass was 17.27 cm and the maximum diameter was 5.28cm. There was no free fluid in the abdomen. An impression of appendiceal mucocele was made after the surgeon and the radiologist carefully analysed the CT scan. A semi-elective right hemi-colectomy was planned. Intraoperative findings: a distended massive appendix pushing the redundant cecal end up to the hepatic flexure of the colon and the tip of the appendix into the right iliac fossa was found. Exploration of the abdomen revealed no metastatic processes, no lymphadenopathy and no other malignancies. The pelvic organs were all normal. There was no leak of appendicular contents and the appendix was not adherent to surrounding structures. The distended appendix was isolated carefully and delivered from the abdomen. A right hemicolectomy was performed making sure not to rupture the appendix or cause any leakage of its contents. A stapled functional end-to-end ileo-colic anastomosis was performed. The patient recovery was uneventful and was discharged day 6 post-operation. She was seen at the outpatient clinic 6 weeks later and had uneventful postoperative course. Histology results revealed a low-grade appendicular mucinous neoplasm with negative margins and no involved mesenteric lymph nodes.  Histopathology report *All slide sections are stained with Haematoxylin & Eosin (H/E) X50: low power viewing) : the appendiceal wall shows a flattened and misplaced epithelium (on top) as well as marked fibrosis surrounding a focus of dystrophic calcification (blue stained material in the centre of the image) X100 and x400: medium and high power viewing) : the appendiceal wall shows an intestinal type covering epithelium (right side) comprising of crowded columnar cells with basal, hyperchromatic nuclei and large amounts of apical mucin as well as minimal dysplastic changes. Marked fibrosis beneath the epithelial lining is readily apparent. *Fibrosis and chronic inflammation are secondary changes due to luminal compression in a long-standing disease.",human
" On past history there was no history of similar illness in past neither there was any past history of significant medical or surgical illness. There was no family history of similar complaints. The patient did not take any treatment for the above complaints and presented for the first time in our hospital for the similar complaints.  General examination reveals normal and stable vital parameters. There was no icterus or pallor. The examination of remaining body did not reveal any other swelling. The systemic examination of other systems was within normal limits. On local examination there was a globular mass on right side of palate with normal overlying mucosa was seen. The lesion appeared to arise from mid part of palate, extending up to the posterior border of hard palate. It was non-tender, firm, and non compressible and had well defined margins. Posteriorly it was limited by the posterior margin of soft palate and anteriorly merging with the soft palate. Superiorly it was extending into nasopharyngeal region. The transillumination test was negative. Rest of otorhinolaryngological examination did not reveal any other significant abnormality. On the basis of history and clinical examination a diagnosis of solid non infectious mass of soft palate likely of benign etiology was made. The possibility of infective etiology (palatal abscess) was less likely as there no fever neither there was any tenderness or erythema.  She was then advised a contrast enhanced computed tomography scan of paranasal sinuses. CT scan was performed on a dual source 128 slice spiral CT with coronal and saggital reformations. The CT scan revealed a well defined homogeneously enhancing hypodense soft tissue les ion of size 4,27 cm X 4cm X 4,5 cm arising from right side of soft palate and abutting the hard palate anteriorly, uvula posteriorly, tongue inferiorly and nasopharyngeal wall superiorly. Laterally it was seen to be abutting the right lateral nasopharyngeal wall.  There was no infiltration of the surrounding structures with well defined surrounding planes. There was no non enhancing area within to suggest central necrosis of secondary infection.  The radiological features were suggestive of a benign etiology neoplastic mass. The possibility of other clinical diagnosis of palatal abscess was completely ruled out. The patient was then advised surgical excision of the lesion. A biopsy was performed, which was suggestive of PA. All preoperative blood and urine investigations were done, which were within normal limits.  The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia. The excised mass was 5 × 4 cm and surgical wound was closed with advancement of adjacent mucosa.  Histopathological examination revealed epithelial and mesenchymal cells and along with other features was suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. The healing was satisfactory. No recurrence was observed after a follow-up period of 1 year.",human
"The first obstetrical utrasonography requested two days prior to admission revealed an abdominal pregnancy of 32 weeks and 3 days with a live foetus and severe oligoamnios. The placenta was inserted over the fundus of her polymyomatous uterus and probably on the omentum without contact with big vessels. This result prompted her referral to our service for management. She had her first menses at 12 years old. Her menstrual cycle is regular with duration of 30 days and she bleeds for four days. She had no method of contraception and her first coïtus was at 16. She has had a total of 6 sexual partners. She reported a past history of pelvic inflammatory disease due to Chlamydia. Her blood group is A rhesus positive. She has no allergy and has never received blood transfusion. She was G 5 P 2022. The first and third pregnancies ended by normal deliveries of two boys weighing 3 700grammes (g) and 4 300g respectively. After 8 years of secondary infertility following the first delivery she had a tubal pregnancy treated medically. The 4th pregnancy was in the right tube and led to an emergency salpingectomy following rupture. Her husband is a 33 year old smoker with tobacco index of 3.4 packet-years. Systemic enquiry revealed painful active foetal kicks since the 16th week of pregnancy.  On physical exam, her general condition was good and vital parameters were normal. Cardiac and pulmonary exams were normal. Her abdomen presented a scar corresponding to a Pfannenstiel incision. On palpation, foetal parts were easily felt just beneath the abdominal wall. The symphysio-xyphoïdal distance was 38 centimeters and the abdominal circumference was 90 centimeters. The foetus was in transverse lie and foetal heart rate was 146 beats per minute. Bowel sounds were normal. Under speculum, the cervico-vaginal mucosa was normal and the cervix was closed and deviated to the left. Digital vaginal exploration revealed a long firm and closed cervix with and increased uterus consistent with a pregnancy of 16 weeks. Our working diagnosis was an abdominal pregnancy with a live foetus at 34 weeks and 2 days. We admitted the patient and planned a semi-urgent laparotomy after lung maturation with corticosteroids (2 intramuscular injections of 12 milligrammes of bethamethasone 24 hours apart). Anesthesiologists and digestive surgeons evaluated the patient and six pints of compatible packed red blood cells were booked. After a normal pre-operative work up, laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: an intra-peritoneal gestational sac with severe oligoamnios containing a live male foetus weighing 2.600 g. Roughly 80 % of the placenta was inserted on intestinal loops and omentun and the remaining 20 % was inserted on the uterine fundus. The foetus was bent on the left side and his right foot was talipes valgus. We didn't found hemoperitoneun. The uterus was soft, globular and consistent with a pregnancy of 16 weeks. The uterine adnexae were not visible and the pelvis free of adhesions. After extraction of the foetus, the umbilical cord was cut flush with the placenta that was left in situ because of the high risk of severe bleeding. Two Delbet corrugated drains were put in parieto-colic gutters and in the pouch of Douglas. The patient did well post - operatively and the drains were removed on the fourth post operative day. Seven days after surgery serial abdominal ultrasonography and dosages of plasmatic beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) were started. The first β-hCG level was 13 266 milliunits per milliliter and first ultrasound revealed a vascularised placental mass. The patient was discharged eight days after written counseling on danger signs that should prompt emergency consultation (abdominal pain, abdominal trauma, dizziness, extreme fatigue). The placenta and beta hCG took eleven months to disappear completely. The baby was immediately admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit where he died 3 hours later with a diagnosis of severe respiratory distress.",human
"However, after 24 hours she was seen to be deteriorating with confusion and decreased conscious level so was transferred to our unit, the referral hospital for the region.  Here an intern doctor assessed her and made a provisional diagnosis of sepsis of unknown origin and started the patient on broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and fluids. At this stage no observations were recorded and no formal scale was used to assess her conscious level, although it was commented on that she ""unresponsive"". Again, no documentation was made as to whether she was given the treatment prescribed.  The following morning she was reviewed by the author, now more than 48 hours since delivery. The patient's observations were pulse rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, blood pressure 110/75 mmHg and oxygen saturations were 82% on air. No temperature was recorded as no thermometer was available in the unit. She appeared clinically dehydrated, with concentrated urine, and her GCS was 7. On examination the chest had bilateral basal crepitations, heart sounds were normal and there was a distended abdomen. On vaginal examination there was minimal lochia and it was non-offensive. She was given oxygen therapy at the highest concentration available (4L/min via nasal prongs) and saturations improved to 92%. The patient was given IV antibiotics, 2 litres of IV normal saline and a decision was made to perform an abdominal ultrasound scan. This was done quickly and the only positive findings were of significant free fluid/haemoperitoneum. At this point the diagnosis was sepsis with possible uterine rupture. A decision was made for exploratory laparotomy. A sub-umbilical midline incision was performed and at laparotomy there were findings of 2-3L of blood stained ascites, sloughy exudate all over the intra-abdominal organs, and a posterior uterine rupture in a transverse direction approximately 7cm in width. The site of the rupture was very low 1-2cm above the internal os of the cervix, although it had not extended into the cervix, vagina or laterally. In view of the viability of the uterine tissue and site of rupture a sub-total hysterectomy was performed and the abdomen washed-out and closed. In the following 24 hours the patient's condition continued to deteriorate and although her urine output improved with the IV fluids, her conscious level did not improve, and in-fact deteriorated to a GCS of 5 and then 3. Treatment was mainly palliative from then on and the patient died a few days later.",human
"There was associated pain as the child was said to cry whenever the swelling was touched. This was said to be after the incision and drainage. There was also limitation of movement at the elbow joint as the swelling spread to involve the elbow joint. A few days after the incision of the swelling, which was 6 weeks before presentation the child developed a low grade intermittent fever which was temporarily relieved by paracetamol. Various herbal preparations were applied to the swelling along with oral administration of over the counter drugs with no improvement. Mother did not book for antenatal care though pregnancy was said to be uneventful with no history of early rash with fever or exposure to irradiation. Mother took herbal preparations for about a month from the 7 th month of gestation. She did not take any other known drugs. She delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery at term at a traditional birth attendant's home. Physical examination revealed an infant who was mildly pale, afebrile (T=37°C), anicteric, not cyanosed, and had a left axillary lymphadenopathy measuring 1cm in diameter, firm, mobile and non tender. Examination of the musculoskeletal system showed a large swelling on the left forearm involving the elbow and upper part of the arm, the overlying skin was hyperaemic and had dilated veins. The swelling which measured 12cm by 10cm was firm, tender with some fluctuant areas. An ulcer measuring 5cm by 8cm was seen on the medial aspect of the extensor surface of the forearm. The edge was raised, the base indurated and the floor had dirty slough. Other systems were essentially normal. An initial diagnosis of soft tissue tumour probably Rhabdomyosarcoma was made. An initial full blood count done was suggestive of sepsis for which the patient was commenced on intravenous Ceftriaxone, and Gentamicin which were irregular due to fianancial constraints. She also had daily dressing of the ulcer. A week into the admission, a wedge excisional biopsy was done and the histology report showed a small blue cell tumour with the following as possibilities; Desmoplastic small cell tumour, Ewing sarcoma, Lymphoma, and Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry test done at another center using membranous staining with MIC2 (12E7) antigen (CD99) gave a final diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma. An initial chest x-ray done was normal. X-ray of the left forearm showed erosion of the ulna bone. Other investigations such as wound swab microscopy and culture, blood culture and liver function tests were ordered for but were not done because of financial difficulties. A month after admission, disarticulation of the left arm with an above elbow amputation was performed, and the child was to commence adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. However, her parents were unable to procure cytotoxic drugs due to financial constraints. On the 48 th day of admission, a swelling was noticed over the thoracolumbar spine, which was suspected to be a metastatic lesion. An X-ray of the thoracolumbar spine was requested but was never done due to financial constraints. She continued to have intermittent pyrexia despite treatment with intravenous ceftriaxzone which was later changed to ceftazidime. She also received oral antibiotics when parents could not afford intravenous drugs and antimalarials. She later developed acute watery diarrhea with mild dehydration for which she was given oral rehydration solution. She had a total of three full blood count tests done throughout her hospital stay which were suggestive of sepsis and also electrolytes and urea during the diarrhoeal episode which was essentially normal except for low bicarbonate which was corrected. The patient eventually succumbed to probable sepsis as an immediate cause of death and died after two months on admission.",human
"Two weeks before, she had a tympanoplasty on the right ear for chronic suppurative otitis media without any immediate post-procedure complications. Her past medical history revealed a left ear tympanoplasty in 2011. She is HIV positive, acquired from her mother, and she has been on a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine since the age of 5 years. Her last CD4 cell count was 198cell/µL. Her mother died of HIV/AIDS when she was about 4 years old leaving her alone with her busy father. This has made her vulnerable to sexual abuses and she has had about eight reported episodes of rape since the age of 12 years. As a result, she was put on oral contraceptives (OCPs) since the age 13 years and was switched to injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera 4 months ago. She denied any history of alcohol intake, cigarette smoking or using illicit drugs. There was no family history of strokes, sudden deaths or clotting disorders. Examination after convulsion revealed an afebrile and anxious patient with a regular pulse rate of 127 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 28/minute and a blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg. She had no lymphadenopathy and there were no bleeding or discharge from both ears. She had nuchal rigidity but without any neurological deficits. Examination findings of the abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable. The patient’s initial investigations revealed normal full blood count, renal and liver function tests. Her random blood glucose was 4.9mmol/L and she had negative antinuclear antibody test results. Cerebrovascular fluid examination revealed a slightly turbid fluid with 6 white cells/mm 3 and 75 red blood cells/mm 3. A computed tomography of the brain with contrast showed diffuse meningeal enhancement, white matter oedema of the left brain hemisphere and a filling defect at the confluence of the transverse cerebral veins suggestive of thrombosis of the sagittal vein. The patient was admitted for anticonvulsants and anticoagulation on the wards. One day after admission she had about 10 episodes of sided convulsions, with residual right sided hemiparesis. The power of all the muscle groups in the right upper and lower limbs was grade 2/5. A Magnetic Resonance venography established superior sagittal and left transverse sinuses thrombosis. Furthermore, there were venous infarction with haemorrhagic component and oedema in the left frontal, temporal, occipital and parietal lobes. In addition to continuation of anticoagulation, anticonvulsants were optimized to control convulsions. There was a reduction of seizure episodes over the subsequent five days and the patient’s neurological deficit slowly normalized inthe next three weeks. She was then discharged home with mild hemiparesis and her subsequent outpatient visits showed no neurologic deterioration. Case report 2 A 44-year old female presented with a constant, throbbing and worsening headache over the past three days. The headache was generalized in nature, associated vomiting, photophobia, dizziness and diplopia. There was no history convulsion, limb weakness or parasthesia. She denied any history of trauma, fever or any loss of consciousness. Her past medical history was significant of HIV disease for the past 10 years. She was on Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine treatment, and her last CD4 count was 293 cell/µl two months ago. She did not smoke cigarettes and had never used contraceptive pills. There was no family history of strokes, sudden deaths or clotting disorders. On examination, the patient was teary, in obvious discomfort, afebrile and with normal vital signs. Her Glasgow coma scale was GCS 15/15 with normal pupils and extra-ocular muscle movement. There were signs of meningism without any neurological deficits. Examinations of other systems were unremarkable and she had normal baseline blood tests. Lumbar puncture had an opening pressure of 23 cm H2O with a closing pressure of 10 cmH2O and normal laboratory cerebrospinal fluid results. The patient was admitted for observation in the ward and discharged three days later when her CSF culture results were negative. Two days after discharge, she was readmitted with worsening headache, photophobia and diplopia. On examination she had normal vital signs, neck stiffness and bilateral lateral rectus muscle weakness. A repeat lumbar puncture showed opening and closing pressures of 30cm and 15cm of H 2 O respectively. The headache improved after lumbar puncture, and her cerebrospinal fluid microscopy and culture results were once more negative. A non-contrast computed tomography showed ill-defined sulci and hyper-density along the sagittal, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. With intravenous contrast, filling defects were noted in the above sinuses. There were no obvious haemorrhages, infarcts or mass effect noted. We made a diagnosis of thrombosis of the superior sagittal, right transverse and left sigmoid sinuses. The patient was started on low molecular weight heparin and subsequently continued on oral warfarin. Few days later, she had five episodes of generalised seizures without any residual neurological deficits. Fundoscopy revealed papilloedema that subsequently improved with intravenous Manitol. Similarly, her seizures were controlled by phenytoin and she was discharged about three weeks later without any neurologic deficit.",human
"Her most recent CD4 count was 367 units/ml with undetectable viral loads. In 2004, she presented with renal insufficiency and nephrotic range proteinuria that subsequently receded after a short course of oral steroids and initiation of highly active antiretrovirals (HAART). She had, since then, been followed for a stable stage 3 chronic kidney disease. She stopped cigarette smoking and alcohol intake about two years ago. She denied any history of drug abuse and she had never been on oral contraceptive pills. On admission, she was clinically afebrile but desaturated at SO 2 85% on room air. Her blood pressure was 117/76 mm Hg and she had a pulse rate of 96 beats per minute. There was marked dilatation of both jugular veins and mild bilateral ankle oedema. She had no murmurs and her lungs were clear. A 12-lead electrocardiogram detected a sinus rhythm of 96 beats per minutes, right axis deviation, and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest X-ray showed moderate cardiomegaly with clear lung fields. Her laboratory results were: WBC, 6370/ml; Haemoglobin, 13.3g/dl; platelets, 274 × 10 9 /l; Sodium, 140mmol/l; Potassium, 5.5mmol/l; Urea, 13.3mmol/l; Creatinine, 181µmol/l; ALP, 354U/l; ALT, 23.2u/l; AST, 37.3U/l; total protein, 86.5g/l; albumin, 37.3g/l; and glucose 12.88mmol/l. Arterial blood gases showed: PH 7.42; PC0 2 40mmHg; PO 2 56mmHg and HC0 3 25.1mmol/l. Two dimensional transthoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiographs showed a large lobulated and mobile mass in the right atrium. It was attached posteriorly to the lower part of the right atrium and extended into inferior vena cava. The tricuspid valves were not distinctively visible. The mass was moving to and fro into the right ventricle with each cycle without any significant occlusion of the tricuspid valve. There was a free flow of blood between the right atrium and ventricle. The right atrium and ventricle were dilated. The right and left ventricular systolic functions were normal. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. The superior vena cava was normal. The abdominal ultrasound confirmed the extension of the mass into the inferior vena cava. Other abdominal findings were otherwise unremarkable. Despite over two years of anticoagulant therapy, the mass remained unchanged in size. She consequently underwent surgery. At operation, a rubbery, creamy coloured and mobile atrial mass (5 × 5 × 3 cm) arising from the inferior vena cava (IVC) was appreciated. It was free from the right atrial wall and the tricuspid valve but extended into the inferior vena cava. The atrial mass was easily detached from the junction of the inferior vena cava and removed completely. The extension into the IVC was fixed to the caval walls. It was not removed as this would have ruptured the inferior vena cava. Histology revealed a fibrous tissue with embedded red cells and extensive calcification, compatible with a calcified thrombus. The patient died 24 hours postoperatively due persistent hypotension and progressive right failure. The chest was re-opened before she died and revealed a tense dilated right atrium, hypokinetic right ventricle with no evidence of pericardial effusion. She most likely died from pulmonary embolism caused by fragments from the IVC thrombus.",human
"Past medical history revealed that patient was hypertensive and diabetic since 5 and 4 years respectively and currently on medication. Past dental history and supportive investigations revealed that patient underwent check up 4 years ago at a ENT doctor where it was provisionally diagnosed as a case of Nasal myiasis, surgical debridement of the lesion was done and maggots were retrieved. Plain and contrast computed tomography of brain revealed a sharply defined, mildly hyperdense space occuping lesion of 24 x 19 mm in left temporal region and effaced sulcal spaces which showed mild enhancement on contrast with mild hyperostosis with widening of diploic spaces of greater wing of sphenoid bones which was suggestive of a meningioma. Following which patient was admitted at a Private dental hospital, treatment protocol was informed to the patient and after obtaining informed consent from the patient, he was posted for surgery under general anesthesia. Maxillectomy on the left side was done, after 2 months of regular debridements and obtaining sterile cultures from the surgical wound, acrylic palatal obturator was fabricated making alginate impressions.  Extra oral examination revealed a gross facial asymmetry with sunken appearance with loss of normal nasolabial fold on the left side of the face. TMJ and lymph nodes examination showed no abnormality. Intra oral examination showed a surgical defect in relation to the left maxillary quadrant with well defined borders. The depth of the lesion showed a grayish black necrotic pseudo membranous slough with yellowish areas interspersed all over. Other intra oral findings were multiple missing teeth in left and right maxilla and periodontally compromised mandibular teeth.  Based on the past history and intra oral examination, a provisional diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the surgical defect was given. Other lesions such as Tuberculosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, Tertiary syphilis, fungal infections such as Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis were considered. Radiologic investigations of Panaromic radiograph and computed tomography were advised. Panaromic radiograph revealed multiple missing teeth (12 11 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 37) and huge surgical defect in favor of left maxillectomy. Paranasal sinus radiograph view showed radiolucency which is diffuse, with irregular borders involving the left maxillary antrum and deviated nasal spine and changes in favor of left maxillectomy. Computed axial tomography revealed in favor of post operative left maxillectomy, deviated nasal spine to right, left ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinusitis. Changes seen involving left pterygoid plates and posterior wall of maxillary antrum suggestive of residual changes of Osteomyelitis.  Biochemical investigations such as complete blood picture, serum creatinine were within normal limits with increased Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Glycoslyated hemoglobin was 9.2% suggestive of diabetes mellitus. Incisional biopsy was done and the specimen was obtained from the left maxillary antrum through endoscope under local anesthesia and was sent to Culture sensitivity tests which showed positivity for bacterial and fungal growth on KOH culture media.  The specimen was further sent for Periodic acid Schiff staining which showed large non septate fungal hyphae branched at right angles. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination which showed cellular connective tissue stroma composed of mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate predominantly neutrophils and lymphocytes, numerous large non septate fungal hyphae branching at right angle along with few areas of necrosis. There is presence of ciliated columnar epithelium along with few bony trabaculae and extensive areas of hemorrhage along with super added bacterial infection suggestive of “mucormycosis.  Correlating clinically, radiologically and histologically a final diagnosis of CHRONIC OSTEOMYEILITIS WITH MUCORMYCOSIS was given. Our patient underwent extensive unilateral endoscopic nasosinusal surgery with debridement of left maxillary sinus,anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells and extensive removal of invaded mucosa under general anesthesia. Extensive fungal masses and necrotic slough were excised from left maxillary and sphenoidal sinus. Necrotic mucosa was removed till the healthy margins were visible which showed initial signs of bleeding. Liposomal Amphotericin B (5 mg/kg) was started immediately after the surgery and dosage was increased to (7.5 mg/kg) after 3 weeks. A week later patient underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for 21 dives, each session lasting for 150 min along with systemic delivery of antifungal drugs orally for time period of 4 weeks. Post operative visit of the patient showed negative cultures with no morbidity and patient was delivered an acrylic obturator with soft liners.",human
"On left side swelling was 11X8X6 cm3 (approx.), non-tender, firm to hard in consistency, surface was regular and it was associated with restricted mobility and it was possible to get over the swelling, transillumination was negative. On right side swelling was 8X6X5 cm3 (approx.), non-tender, firm to hard in consistency, surface was regular and it was associated with restricted mobility, it was possible to get over the swelling, transillumination was negative. Testicular sensations on the left side were absent and on the right side were altered (reduced). Also, the inguinal lymph nodes were bilaterally swollen, non-tender and palpable. Patient was admitted to the male surgery ward with a provisional diagnosis of the bilateral testicular malignancy. Patient was admitted and routine and diagnostic investigations were performed, hemoglobin was 14.6 gm%, Total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count and platelet count were within their normal range. Serum urea and electrolyte levels were normal. Liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits. Chest radiograph did not reveal any abnormality. Urine routine and microscopic examinations were normal; blood group and cross matching were also done. Special investigations included the assessment of serum tumour markers Beta HCG was elevated 12 mIU/ml, Alpha-fetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the bilateral enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes with normal echosensitivity and morphology. Testes were multilobulated enlarged and multiple whorled masses were seen scattered all around with peripheral vascularity suggestive of neoplastic nature. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed left testis was enlarged measuring about 11X8.8X7.8cm and appears heterogeneously hypodense with a CT attenuation value of 20-30HU on post contrast CT scan there was mild heterogeneous enlargement of the testis with CT attenuation of 30-40HU with few enhancing areas. Right testis was enlarged measuring about 8X6.9X5.5cm and appear heterogeneously hypodense with CT attenuation value of 20-30HU on post contrast CT scan there was mild heterogenous enlargement of the testis with CT attenuation of 30-40HU with few enhancing areas. Both epididymis were not seen separately from the enlarged testis bilaterally. There was moderately non enhancing collection seen within the left extra testicular compartment. There were no internal septations suggestive of left hydrocele. The overlying scrotal wall was thin and stretched. Intraoperatively biopsy of the left testis was done from the suspicious area and frozen sections were sent for the histopathological examination. Frozen sections were suggestive of malignancy. Histopathological findings, revealed spermatocytic seminoma stage-IA. The patient underwent Left sided orchidectomy under general anaesthesia and left testis, spermatic cord and the left inguinal lymph nodes were removed. His postoperative period was uneventful. Sutures removed on the 10th day and the wound was healthy. After 5 days intraoperatively biopsy of the right testis was done and frozen sections were sent for the histopathological examination. Frozen sections were suggestive of malignancy which was later confirmed as spermatocytic seminoma stage-IA, thus confirming bilateral spermatocytic seminoma. Also the histopathological findings were later confirmed by immunohistochemistry. After 15 days Right sided orchidectomy was performed under general anaesthesia and right testis, spermatic cord and the right inguinal lymph nodes were removed. Sutures removed on the 10th day and the wound was healthy. Histopathological studies revealed that both testes were atrophic and multilobulated. The microscopic evaluation also revealed atrophic seminiferous tubules with reduced spermatogenesis, and dysplastic cells. The seminiferous tubules were surrounded by numerous infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Neoplastic cells and inflammatory infiltrates were present in both testes. The patient was given prophylactic radiotherapy for next 15 days and the total dose given was 20Gy to prevent any relapse. He was advised to follow up every 6 months, presently he was asymptomatic, follow-up CECT abdomen and pelvis are normal, tumor markers are well within the limits and there is no evidence of disease.",human
"The patient underwent an urgent operation of burr hole drainage of CSDH in bilateral frontal-temporal region. During the operation, subdural hematoma launched from bone hole after the opening of the dura in spite of over high intracranial pressure (ICP). The procedure was completed without any obvious accident and the vital signs remained stable during operation. Eventually, a subdural closed system of drainage was placed when intracranial pneumatosis was eliminated absolutely. Because of the exacerbation of conscious disturbance, emergent CT scan was taken at 2 hours postoperatively and revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhage. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Surgical intervention was not adopted, and the patient kept to conservative treatment including continuous neurological observation for 6 days in the NICU. The hospitalization time was prolonged to 20 days because of mental disturbance after the operation which was corrected successfully in that interval. Finally, the patient was discharged from hospital with no neurological deficit except for slight language barriers. At 2-month follow-up no abnormality was noted, and the CT scan revealed hematoma was absorbed completely.  Case 2: in case 2 we reported an 82-years-old man had been admitted to our department due to limbs weakness presented progressive aggravation with undergoing frequent falls in the previous month and a history of cerebral infarction, arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease with long-term oral rivaroxaban. The CT scan showed a right equi-density subdural hematoma and brain tissue compression. The neurologic evaluation revealed slow response and weakness of the left limbs (Table 1). The urgent evacuation of the subdural hematoma was performed with a single parietal burr-hole craniectomy on the right side without discontinuing oral rivaroxaban. A subdural drainage catheter was positioned in prefrontal region routinely. Surprisingly, we observed right visual field defect the following day and vital signs was remained within normal range all the time. The post-operative CT scan showed a bit of prefrontal pneumocephalus and right occipital lobe hemorrhage and no acute bleedings in ipsilateral subdural space. The drainage tube removal was delayed to the fourth day. Meanwhile, the CT findings occipital hematoma appeared absorbed gradually and did not require surgical intervention. The neurologic evaluation revealed a slight postural instability and for this reason that the patient was arranged to physical therapy. At two-month follow-up, the patient was able to walk unaided, and the review CT scan was normal.  Case 3: in case 3 we reported an 80-years-old man had been admitted to our department due to moderate dizziness and headache for 20 days with a history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Neurological assessment confirmed mental confusion and gait imbalance without focal deficits. The CT scan revealed a sizeable right chronic subdural hematoma which caused midline left shift (Table 1). The patient underwent an instant single burr-hole craniectomy and the right subdural hematoma evacuation was satisfactory largely. A subdural drainage apparatus was positioned routinely. On the second day after surgery, sudden airways spasm occurred and blood oxygen saturation presented unstable within a short time. Emergency tracheal incubation was implemented to maintain vital signs. Simultaneously, the drainage device was closed and a emergent CT scan was performed and revealed the presence of a small area occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. On the third day, the patient was transferred to the ICU and assisted respiration with ventilator postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient was required tracheotomy due to difficulty of removing trachea cannula within a short time. The drainage tube removal was delayed to the fifth day postoperatively. After one week, the patient successfully detached from the respirator and returned to general ward to continue anti-infective treatment for 10 days. Finally, the patient discharged from hospital with mild pulmonary inflammation, but therapeutic process was uneventful, and the total hospitalization time was up to one month. The two-month follow-up showed the patient was in good conditions and life-independent. The CT scan of the head revealed no recurrence.",human
"This lesion extended throughout the right mandibular crest and had been evolving for 1 month, according to the patient. The neurological examination revealed a unilateral labial-chin hypoaesthesia suggestive of malignancy. The craniofacial CT scan examination revealed an infiltration of the right lateral mandibular soft tissues associated with a poorly-limited osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest in relation to the floating tooth 45. It was associated with bilateral multiple lymph nodes (submandibular, supraclavicular and jugulo-carotid), the largest of which measured 20 mm.  A biopsy was performed. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations led to the conclusion that the tumour is a large B-cell lymphoma of the mandibular gingiva. Histologically, there were large tumour cells having clear and abundant cytoplasm with nuclei showing several marked atypias. The mitoses and the apoptotic bodies were quite numerous. The tumour was the site of important necrotic changes. In immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells strongly and diffusely expressed CD45 and CD20. They did not express CD3 and CK.  The patient was referred to the onco-haematology department where a chemotherapy-based treatment was initiated. She showed a clear improvement in her condition after the first cycles. Second case: a 16-year-old male patient with acute articular rheumatism and a history of erysipelas at the age of 7 years was hospitalized in the General Surgery Department because of a deterioration of his general condition. Originally, the patient suffered from epigastralgia, vomiting and an influenza state for which he had a symptomatic treatment. This was aggravated by a progressive onset of pain in the right iliac fossa with diarrhea-like transit disorders.  He was referred to our department to manage a left mandibular swelling with a suspected abscess of dental origin. The extraoral clinical examination revealed the presence of palpable left cervical lymphadenopathy with normal mouth opening. The intraoral examination showed an extensive gingival mass ranging from teeth 34 to 37 with terminal dental mobilities evolving for 3 weeks. On the neurological examination, the patient described a sensation of hypoaesthesia along the path of the left inferior alveolar nerve. The radiological examination revealed the presence of a bone destruction involving teeth furcation in the left molar region.  The abdominal CT scan evoked a tumoural mass of the ileocecal junction associated with a peritoneal carcinomatosis as well as multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which measured 31*21mm. The biological analyzes showed a significant increase in CRP values at 117 and in LDH at 789 (Table 1), indicating the existence of a biological inflammatory syndrome and tissue damage in the body. HIV serology was negative. In this context, an association between the oral lesion and the abdominal tumour was suspected, suggesting a cancer of lymphomatous origin.  A biopsy of the oral lesion was performed and the patient was surgically operated for his abdominal tumour in the general surgery department. The results of the anatomopathological examinations were in agreement with our suspicion. It was a Burkitt lymphoma with primary abdominal and secondary oral localisations. Histologically, there was a lymphomatous proliferation of diffuse architecture consisting of small to medium lymphocytes, basophilic cytoplasm with too many mitoses. In the immunohistochemical study, the lymphocytes were of phenotype B expressing markers CD20 (+), CD10 (+) and heterogeneous Bcl6. The tumour proliferation index Ki67 was 100%.  The postoperative follow-up was straightforward and the patient was referred to the onco-haematology department where a chemotherapy treatment was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient died one month later.",human
"The patient underwent menopause at age 48 years, with an uneventful past menstrual cycle. She had no medical history except the benign thyroid nodule, no relevant surgical history and had not received hormonal therapy. Routine blood chemistry and serum tumor marker analysis showed that the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 125, and human epididymis protein 4 were all within the normal ranges. Uterine cervical cytology at the time of admission was normal. TVS showed a left ovarian unilocular cyst, size 6cm × 5cm × 4cm, with diffuse low-level internal echoes, thin walled, smooth margined, no septa and no papillary projections. The uterus size was 6cm × 4cm × 3cm, and a 1cm uterine myoma was found in the fundus. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ECT) images revealed a unilocular cystic lesion measuring 6 cm at its widest dimension, without enhancing solid intramural nodules and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or ascites. CT scan indicated benign ovarian cystic tumors.  The patient underwent laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. On laparoscopic inspection, the cyst was found to be located in the ampullary and fimbrial regions of the left fallopian tube. The left fallopian tube was grossly unremarkable and the left ovary was atrophied. The left ovary and tube were completely separate from the cyst and the cyst was surrounded by a translucent wall with serous cystic components, but solid components were not seen inside. Clinical diagnosis was suggestive of left paratubal cyst. The patient underwent hysterectomy and BSO. Although tumor markers were normal and there was no presence of papillary projections, the progression in size in the postmenopausal woman indicated a possible malignancy. Frozen sections were prepared from surgery specimens and confirmed a benign cyst. After surgery, the pelvic cavity was explored and no specific findings were found in the abdominal cavity.  Histopathological examination of the paratubal cyst revealed the presence of polypoid lesions on the internal surface of the cyst. The tumor cells showed nuclear atypism and stratification, which are histological characteristics of borderline tumor. A final diagnosis of paratubal borderline serous tumor was confirmed. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3. CT images were retrospectively evaluated, focusing on the left ovary, fallopian tube, and paratubal cyst after surgery. Multiplanar reconstruction CT imaging revealed linear fat planes between the left ovary and the cyst, indicating that the left ovary, fallopian tube and paratubal cyst were separate structures, similar to those seen during surgery. The tumor was not completely staged, and a comprehensive surgical staging operation was recommended; however, the patient refused adjuvant surgical treatment and opted for close follow-up. Pelvic ECT, TVS and tumor markers were checked every three months. The patient remains asymptomatic and follow-up at 24 months showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis.",human
"A pleural biopsy showed epithelioid granulomatous inflammatory process without caseous necrosis, Ziehl-Neelsen stain and culture for mycobacteria were negative. On admission, the clinical examination revealed an afebrile man with a weight of 46kg and BMI of 17.6 kg/m 2. He had a marked spinal tenderness of the dorso-lumbar spine and important limitation of spinal motion. Our patient did not have respiratory symptoms and his neurologic examination was normal. The laboratory evaluation showed a hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dl and a total leucocyte count of 6400/mm 3 with 72% polymorphonuclear cells, 20% lymphocytes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 st h) and CRP were respectively 80 mm and 27 mg/l. Sputum acid-fast bacilli direct smear as well as mycobacterium culture were negative. HIV test was also negative. Investigations including an x-ray of lumbar showed osteocondensation concerning the lower shelf of L1 and upper shelf of L2, Chest x-ray showed a small pleural effusion on the left. A dorso-lumbar Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed features suggestive of Ttuberculous (TB) spondylitis interesting lower shelf of L1 and upper shelf of L2, respect for the height of the vertebral bodies with discrete epiduritis. MRI also showed a collection of vertebral bodies L1L2, which communicates with another one abscessed in the left psoas. Computerized tomography (CT) - guided evacuation of a psoas abscess was performed, which revealed purulent material staining negative on Gram stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The cultures of the abscess material showed no growth. In view of the high prevalence rate of TB, antecedent of pleural tuberculosis and MRI appearance, the diagnosis of Pott's disease was retained and the duration of treatment was prolonged to 9 months and the patient was placed in a spinal brace for stabilization of the vertebral column. Despite good adherence to treatment, low back pain worsened. 6 months after the diagnosis of tuberculosis spondylitis, the patient developed purulent collections in the soft tissues in the gluteal and left trochanteric region. A dorso-lombar MRI showed spondylodiscitis L1L2 with a significantly increased size of the left psoas abscess. An abdomino-pelvic CT showed collections in left iliac psoas muscle and the left gluteal and trochanteric region. GeneXpert® MTB/RIF of the vertebral biopsy aspiration product CT-guided revealed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mycobacterium tuberculosis positive, with resistance to Rifampicin. Hain® test of first-line anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) showed resistance to Rifampicin and high-level resistance to Isoniazid. Moreover, Hain® test of second-line ATT (FQ and SLI) showed a high-level resistance to Ofloxacin and sensibility to Kanamycin and Amikacin. Our patient was transferred to MDR-tuberculosis Unit. The superficial collections in the left gluteal and the trochanteric region have been drained under ultrasound. Following. An observed second-line treatment was initiated using amikacin, clofazimine, prothionamide, linezolid, delamanide, pyrazinamide et ethambutol, with monitoring for adverse events. At 6 months, injectable Amikacin and Delamanide were stopped, while other oral drugs were continued. Second-line ATT was given for a total duration of 20 months. The evolution under second-line treatment was marked by an improvement in an inflammatory lumbar pain, gain in weight and a disappearance of soft tissue collections. CRP and VS were normalized. Imaging monitoring performed at 12 months of second line treatment, showed no residual collections in thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT, MRI found a vertebral fracture L1-L2 and quasidisappearance of psoas collection, only a small collection measuring less than 1cm was found without enhancement after gadolinium injection. Our patient received 20 months of treatment that it was tolerated, apart from the paresthesias of the 4 limbs which was managed by vitamin therapy, with stabilization of the vertebral lesions without the appearance of new collections. He was declared cured and he is following a rehabilitation program with stretching and strengthening of the spinal muscles.",human
"She reports chronic pain on the 5 th finger of the hand with progressive enlargement of the finger, paresthesia, tactile pain and swelling of the ulnar region of the hand. On the clinical examination, a painful palpable mass on the phalanx with crepitation was observed, with a limited passive/active proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) flexion. The volume of the PP5th was considerable. The range of movement of the PIP was 0 degree of extension and 15 degree of flexion. Tinel's Sign and Phalen's Maneuver are negative. Normal range-of-motion of the wrist was observed. Instrumental tests: on anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the fingers, a complete absorption of the CPC, with an increased dimensions of the phalanx it was noted. Radiographs revealed a well-demarcated and pathologic fracture with cortical thinning of the PP5th, with a radiolucent mass in the diaphysis of the same phalanx. The soft tissue mass was relatively well marginated. The hematochemical analysis excluded the presence of rheumatic disease or an increase of the uric acid levels. Intraoperative findings and surgical technique: surgery was performed in accordance with the technique described by Tsuge in 1989, which consisted in the disarticulation of the fifth metacarpal, together with amputation of the fifth ray of the hand [6]. An axillary block anesthesia was carried out and a tourniquet was applied. Tumor excision was performed through a volar Z-Brunner type incision and dorsal longitudinal extension along the digit. A Y-shaped incision began dorsally at the base of the fifth metacarpal, continued in a diamond form in the dorsal space between the fourth and the fifth metacarpal and ended in a V-shape on the palmar side at the level of the proximal transverse palmar plica. The dorsal skin flap was unglued to expose the fourth dorsal interosseous and the portion of the metacarpus to be resected. After complete bone exposure, the oblique mid-diaphysis osteotomy of the fifth metacarpal was performed, leaving its base in place to maintain distal insertion of the carpal ulnar extensor. Subsequently, the extensor muscle tendon section of the little finger and of the joint extensor tendon of the fifth finger were performed, without injuring the common extensor tendon of the fourth finger. The hypotensive intrinsic muscles were leaved, while the fifth abductor tendon was distal sectioned and sutured to the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle. After ligature of the common digital vessels at their base, the corresponding nerve endings were cauterized at the same level and pushed into the interosseous muscular tissue. Then the deep intermetacarpal ligament was incised, stretched transversely between the head of the fourth and fifth metacarpal bone. Finally, the distal portion of the fifth metacarpal bone was removed. At this point, the abductor tendon of the fifth finger was sutured on the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle, to fill the gap created by the fifth metacarpal bone removal. The skin flap was sutured first to the palm. Secondary, the skin was sutured to the dorsal hand where the skin, thin and mobile, is more easily modeled. A soft bandage was then applied to the patient's forearm with the fourth and third fingers included.  Functional rehabilitation program started at two weeks post-operatively and it was designed in order to increase the range of motion and the strength of the hand grip. Histological analysis revealed a benign expansive EC of the hand. The patient resumes her job at the factory after 2 months. One year after surgery, clinical and a radiographic assessment were carried out. The patient reported the absence of any subjective problems, with complete functional recovery of the operated hand. She was satisfied with the cosmetic results that had been achieved and the hand functionality.",human
"Patient was given the option of orthognathic surgery to correct his VME or lip repositioning procedure (LRP) to reduce his gummy smile and improve esthetics. He elected LRP to address the gummy smile and avoid higher morbidity and costs associated with orthognathic surgery. The patient's expectations were clarified, and a realistic outcome was presented, including the possibility of full or partial relapse. Written informed consent was obtained after an explanation of the risks, potential benefits, and treatment alternatives. The aim of the technique lip repositioning is a surgical way to correct gummy smile by limiting the retraction of the elevator smile muscles (orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris, zygomaticus minor). Local anesthesia (Mepivacaine 2% with adrenaline 1:80,000) was administered at the vestibular mucosa and lip from the maxillary right to left first molar. The incision outline was marked with an indelible pencil on the dried tissue using mucogingival junction and base of the vestibule as reference lines connected at mesial line angles of the right and left maxillary molars to create an elliptical outlineas. Incisions were made in the surgical area, and both superior and inferior partial thickness flap was raised from maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar. A partial thickness incision was made between these two lines, and epithelial band approximately 10-12 mm wide was excised leaving underlying connective tissue exposed. Care was taken to avoid damage to any minor salivary glands in the submucosa and tissue tags were removed. The mucosal flap was advanced and multiple interrupted sutures at 1 mm were taken at the midline and other locations along the borders of the incision mucogingival junction using 3-0 vicryl sutures. No periodontal dressing was placed. Immediately postoperatively significant improvement in the patient facial and smile was observed. Post-operative instructions included soft diet, limited facial movements, no brushing around the surgical site for 14 days and placing ice packs over the upper lip. The patient was instructed to rinse gently with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily for 2 weeks. Post-operative Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 400 mg B.D for 5 days were prescribed. Post-operative healing occurred, and the patient reported minimal post-operative bruising, or extraoral swelling and slight pain when smiling for 1 week after surgery. Sutures were removed 2 weeks later. The suture line healed in the form of a scar that was concealed in the upper lip mucosa and not visible when the patient smiled. This esthetic procedure is safe and has minimal side-effects. The patient was recalled after every 3 months for follow-up. Gingival display at baseline was 7-8 mm which changed drastically at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. At 3 months and at 6 months gingival display was 3 mm. There was no difference in gingival display between 3 and 6 months. However, a partial relapse was observed after 12 months.",human
"The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder revealed an obstructive left ureteric calculus at the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) measuring 4.7mm. Blood workup revealed an elevated creatinine at 134 µmol/L (59-104 µmol/L) and potassium of 6.26 mmol/L (3.3-5.1 mmol/L) suggestive of obstructive uropathy with acute kidney injury. Given the findings, the patient underwent emergency cystoscopy, left ureteroscopy, stone fragmentation, and Double J (DJ) ureteric stent insertion. The pre-operative assessment involved medication review and ECG, which was considered normal. Intraoperatively he was found to have significant distal left ureteric narrowing at the VUJ with a calculus proximal to the narrowing. The stone was fragmented, DJ stent was deployed, and a Foley catheter was placed to facilitate urinary drainage. In the recovery room, he was found to be desaturating at saturation of 80-85% on room air and required 8 L/min of oxygen supplementation via a face mask to maintain his oxygen saturation above 94%. He was then transferred to the ward for post-operative management and close observation. 12 hours post-transfer to the ward he was found to be tachycardic at 130 beats per minute with normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure ranging from 80/50 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg. On examination, he was alert, not diaphoretic but had cool and clammy extremities. Respiratory examination revealed bilateral basal crepitations. The patient denied having lightheadedness, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, or shortness of breath. On workup, it was found that the patient had an abnormal ECG with ST-segment depressions and T wave inversion on the anterior (V1- V4) and inferior leads (III & aVF), when compared to the preoperative ECG with markedly elevated troponin-T of 174.1 pg/ml (0-14 pg/ml). Other laboratory parameters were: Lactate dehydrogenase 494 IU/L (135-225 IU/L), Pro-BNP 375 pg/ml (0-125 pg/ml), Procalcitonin 1.67 ng/ml (0-2 ng/ml), C-Reactive Protein 312 mg/L (0.5-5 mg/L), INR 1.15, ferritin 1531 µg/l (22-322 µg/l), D-dimer 0.63 µg/ml (0-0.5 µg/ml). A portable chest x-ray revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates with some coalescence observed in the periphery of lungs, a pattern consistent with a CO-RADS 5 classification, highly suggestive of COVID-19, and was later confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). He was transferred to an isolation intensive care unit and started on Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) protocol where he received anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous Enoxaparin 80 mg, 300 mg Clopidogrel, 600 mg Aspirin, and 80 mg Atorvastatin. Within a few hours of the patient's transfer to critical care, his clinical condition deteriorated rapidly necessitating intravenous inotropic support. He was subsequently intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. A repeat Troponin level at 6 hours was increased to 194 pg/ml while there was further documented worsening of renal function with BUN 16.70 mmol/l and creatinine 254 µmol/ L. Unfortunately, a transthoracic echocardiogram was unavailable at the time. His condition continued to deteriorate rapidly, and he went into shock and sustained a cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was carried out according to American Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol but was unsuccessful. The patient was pronounced dead after 30 minutes of CPR.",human
"The budding taking over the entire sole of the foot, the patient decided to consult the Center of Diagnostic and Treatment (CDT) of Tuberculosis of Baleng which, in addition to being the largest CDT in the West region of Cameroon, is also the center for detection and treatment of leprosy. Thus, the orientation of the patient in our hospital was motivated by a suspicion of leprosy. The family history of the patient was unremarkable. The personal history of the patient showed that he was hypertensive with known heart failure for 05 years. He was under cardiurine (captopril 50mg / HCT 25mg) at a dose of one tablet daily and digoxin 0.25 mg at the dose of one tablet every 12 hours. Moreover he had a lipomectomy in 2009. Nothing else was remarkable. The physical examination of the patients revealed an impotence of the left lower limb and a painful wound on the sole of the foot on the same side. Overall, he is an octogenarian with an aspect of undernutrition and slight muscle lost. He presents a moderate hypertension (170/100 mm Hg) and a cardiac arrhythmia. The ulceration of the left foot was important and burgeoning, with few hemorrhagic foci and bleeding on contact. The diagnosis of malignancy with superinfection of the sole of the left foot in a hypertensive patient was made. Blood workouk - FBC: WBC: 5,5 x 10 3 /µl; RBC: 4,58 X 10 6 / µl ; HGB:12.9 g/dL ; MCV: 80 Fl MCH: 29 Pg; MCHC: 35.3g/dL; Plt: 275 x 10 3 /µl - Fasting blood glucose: 0.89 G/L - Urea: 0.42 G/L - Creatinin: 6.10 mg / l - HIV serology was negative - Test of leprosy on the lesion was negative. Culture of the pus collected from the foot revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to cefixime, aminoside, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, rifampicin). A biopsy was done on three different location of the wound. Microscopically, the sample showed a lesion that was focally ulcerated on the surface and superficial dermis. There was a lesion made of granulation tissue with elongated or oval vascular structures. These structures were made of non atypical benign endothelial with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate rich in fibroblasts. There was also a significant fibroblastique proliferation made up of elongated fusiform cells. On the surface, the flaps of malpighien epithelium were slightly hyperplastic: no malignancy. As a conclusion, it was a case of pyogenic granuloma also called botryomycome Treatment After the culture result indicating the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, and anatomopathologic analysis of biopsy suggestive of pyogenic granuloma, the patient's family refuse the surgical excision. The patient was then treated with ceftriaxone 1G X 2 per day and gentalline 80mg x 2 per day for 10 days, in addition to the daily treatment of wound after whashing with water containing betadine. The evolution of the patient was not very satisfactory, and surgical excision proposed again to the family, was again rejected. Moreover, taking in consideration the pharmacodynamics action of rifampicin and the effect of dapsone on the chronic leprous lesions, the following treatment was proposed to our patient: dapsone and rifampicin which were available free of cost in our Center. Our patient was then submitted to dapsone/rifampicin for a period of one month of treatment, the appointment was given at the end of the first wafer. After a month, the response was very encouraging with rather remarkable regression of the swelling and the total disappearance of exuding wounds which bled at the slightest touch.",human
"The patient had a medical history of limited cutanous systemic sclerosis diagnosed by an internal medicine specialist since 3 years and treated by methotrexate, colchicine, amlodipine, methylprednisolone, cholecalciferol, sulodexide, acidumfolicum and Lysinacetylsalicylas. The TMJ and muscle symptoms was noted since 1 year after her diagnosis. These symptoms have slowly worsened prompting the patient to run our specializing consultation. Physical examination of the patient revealed that SSc affected mainly her hands with a fingers movementlimitation, associated with sclerodactyly complicated by digital ulcers, moderate lung fibrosis with a flexion contracture and a claw-like deformity.  The clinical examination of the orofacial region revealed a masklike facies with a smooth and tight facial skin with a loss of normal animation lines and a bilateral stiffness in masticatory muscles at palpation and movements. The mouth opening was limited to 23 mm and the mandible deviated to the right side. The other mandibular movements such as propulsion and deductionare also restricted. The palpation of TMJ region causes severe pain more pronounced in the right side and a restricted condylar movement. No joint sounds and no malocclusion are depicted Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in open-and closed-mouth positions, was performed to evaluate the TMJ and to check an eventual masticatory muscles fibrosis. The MRI showed internal derangement of TMJ, bilateral mandibular condylar process resorption, and disk deformations with heterogeneous appearance. The bilateral mandibular condylar process containssubchondral geodes and thinned cortical on sagittal and coronal views of MRI and hypomobility in open mouth. There was no fibrosis in masticatory muscles. The diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) with arthralgia and myalgia related to SSc was made. The patient was treated by an association of conservative techniques including rest, reassurance and jaw-opening exercises for painful joint. A myorelaxant was prescribed for 10 days to managing myofascial pain and aphysical therapy was indicated for 6 months including massage treatment on the bilateral masseter and temporal muscles, exercises, ultrasound, for improve jaw movements, managing musculoskeletal and myofacial pain. The patient was regularly reviewed monthly to evaluate pain and jaw movements. A great improvement in TMD symptoms was reported. After 2 months of physical therapy, the mouth opening increased from 23 to 33 mm and a reduction in muscle pain was noted. The preauricular and muscle pain was gradually disappeared. The muscle flexibility has been partially improved by physiotherapy. However, a certain rigidity in the area of masseter muscles is still, due to its SSc and skin fibrosis. A relaxant nocturnal occlusal appliance was indicated to stabilize the resultsand was very supported by the patient.",human

Mother also reported free mobility and navigation of rats within and around the house before the incidence. No similar incidence in the other siblings. Examination revealed an acutely ill looking child with complete loss of the left upper and lower eyelids, partial loss of both nares, 2 by 3cm ulcer on the left cheek and left central corneal ulcer. Her weight was1kg, occipitofrontal circumference was, left arm circumference was 37cm and cranial caudal length was 22cm. She was neither pale nor febrile. The right eye with and the adnexae were intact. Systemic examinations were not contributory. She was admitted into special baby care unit (SCBU) of the hospital and was reviewed by the pediatrician who recommended that she should be in the incubator, and was given subcutaneous ante tetanus toxoid 750 IU stat after negative test dose, intramuscular TT 0.5ml stat, intravenous (IV) Unasyn 150mg/kg/dy in 3 divided doses, IV Gentamicin 5mg/kg/day. She was also fed with EBM at 120kcal/kg/day. The wound was cleaned daily with normal saline after review by the plastic surgeon. Generous chloramphenicol ointment was applied over the ocular injury while the globe was protected by Catellar shield during her sleep and at night. She was also commenced on artifial eye tear hourly. Two weeks after the injury she was noticed to have developed left central microbial keratitis. Examination at this time revealed a deeply stained central corneal ulcer with circum-corneal injection. The care giver was offered a referral to a corneal specialist at an outside facility but they declined due to financial constraint. Patient was to have corneal scrapings done for microscopic, culture and sensitivity but the care giver could also not afford it. She was commenced on hourly Lomefloxacillin (3%) eye drop which was procured through voluntary donations from the physicians. The corneal ulcer and infiltrates have resolved and the care giver has been informed of the need for penetrating keratoplasty and lid reconstruction as soon as possible.

"The laboratory findings were normal, including routine blood tests, urine tests, biochemical markers and LDH value. So the radical left orchidectomy was performed and the microscopic examination showed a plasmacytic infiltration with mature plasma cell and some plasmablasts; in the immunohistochemical assay, the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for CD138 and lambda chains but negative for kappa chains and CD20. The pathological report concluded the diagnosis of plasmocytoma with clear surgical margins of the tumor. After this diagnosis, immunoelectrophoresis showed no evidence for hyperproteinemia or paraproteinemia. Whole body bone scan was negative and a bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of polyclonal plasma cells. No Bence Jones or other M components were detected in the urine. Therefore, multiple myeloma was excluded by nuclear medicine, laboratory and histology studies. The therapeutic decision for this patient was the monitoring without any chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sixteen months after surgery, the patient presented a subcutaneous nodule at right iliac fossa, approximately 4cm in size. The aspiration cytology of the skin lesion showed a multiple dystrophic plasma cells, and cutaneous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of plasmocytoma. The serological examination showed an increase of the levels of free light lambda chains 66.25mg/l, and in immunoelectrophoresis we had a hypergammaglobunemia IgA at 15,3g/l. However bone marrow aspiration revealed normal patterns of cell distribution, with absence of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency and anemia. The patient was started on chemotherapy by thalidomide 100mg/day with dexamethasone. Two months later he complained an irregular mass occupying the left side of abdomen; thoraco-abdominal CT scan showed two other localizations: mediastinal at 70x30mm and retroperitoneal 90x60mm. The histological examination showed similar morphology to the testicular tumor. Hence, the histological diagnosis of recurrent plasmacytoma was made. Skeletal surveys did not show any pathological changes. There was no evidence of anemia, hypercalcemia or renal insufficiency. The second bone marrow biopsy was normal. Following this evolution and poor response the patient was retreated by polychemotherapy VTD (bortezomib 1,3 mg/m 2, thalidomide100mg/j, dexamethasone 20 mg/m 2). On follow up, he was asymptomatic but the retroperitoneal mass still presented after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and he developed another skin lesion at 4cm in his back. Electrophoresis of proteins found a peak gamma globulin 49.5 g/l with increasing of light chain lambda 285mg/l, and bone marrow biopsy was still normal. The patient was treated at this time by CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone). Evaluation after three cycles showed a good response, and the CT scan confirmed the disappearance of all masses with normalization of electrophoresis of protein. Because of the frequent recurrence and possibility of transformation into MM, the patient is still on follow up at long term.",human

Cardiac, pulmonary and breast examination were normal. Abdomen circumference was 125 centimeters. Inspection under vaginal speculum revealed a necrotic and hemorrhagic mass of seven centimeters of diameter protruding from the cervix. Digital vaginal examination was not done to avoid contact bleeding. Digital exploration of the rectum revealed no abnormalities. Varicosities were found on both legs. The following work up was done: chest radiography revealed a heart of increased size but no pulmonary abnormality; Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular extra-systoles; ultrasonography and CT Scan of the abdomen and the pelvis revealed a mass limited to the uterine cervix without others abnormalities. The full blood count, liver and function tests and hemostasis work up were normal. Hepatitis B and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses test were negative. Fasting blood sugar level was normal. The working diagnosis was a uterine leiomyosarcoma at stage II of the FIGO (International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) staging system. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out under general anesthesia. The findings were: normal size uterus containing a seven centimeters mass prolapsed through the cervix; uterine serosa invaded by the tumor; macroscopically normal adnexae. The pelvis was free of adhesions. The post operative course was complicated by infection of the abdominal wall. The abscess was drained and secondary closure of the wound was done 22 days after surgery and the patient sent for adjuvant radiotherapy. The Macroscopy showed bulky and necrotic poorly circumcised mass of the corpus uterus. The Histopathology analysis with hematoxylin and eosin stain showed a neoplasm composed of admixture of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The epithelial element was non glandular mostly undifferentiated and squamous carcinoma. The mesenchymal elements were homologous, consisting of leiomyosarcoma. Features were consistent with a Mixed Malignant Müllerian Tumor (MMMTs) also called Carcinosarcoma of the corpus uteri with pathological stage PT3.",human
"The patient was initially treated with Cordarone and because of the persistence of ventricular tachycardia and the occurrence of secondary hyperthyroidism the treatment was changed into flecainide. Then, in front of the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, hyperten (β blocker) was introduced. Radiofrequency ablation was indicated later because of the failure of this medical treatment.   A first attempt of radiofrequency treatment was complicated by ventricular tachycardia with ST elevation and troponin increase. Coronary angiography was normal. A second attempt of radiofrequency treatment was successfully made in the same year and the patient was treated by Detensiel, flecainide and Aspégic. Since the patient hasn't shown ventricular arrhythmias.  Our patient was pregnant and pregnancy was well tolerated. During pregnancy, our patient didn't show ventricular arrhythmia. She was scheduled for cesarean section delivery at the 38th week of pregnancy. Preoperative evaluation showed a pregnant woman in the 34 week of pregnancy with normal somatic examination. Cardiovascular examination showed sinusal cardiac rhythm.  The ECG showed a right bundle branch block and inverted T waves in right precordial leads beyond V1. The chest radiography showed signs of right ventricular hypertrophy and a cardiothoracic index of 0.6. A transthoracic echocardiogram has been requested since and it has shown a dilated RV and reduced LVEF to 40%. Biological blood analyses (blood cell count, prothrombine ration and liver and kidney blood analyses) were correct  We prescribed 6 hours of preoperative fasting and we continued the same treatment received by the patient (Detensiel, and Flucaine ASPEGIC) until the day of surgery. At the end of the consultation we explained the risk of bleeding, transfusion and the risk of per operative cardiac rhythm disorders. We informed the patient about the anesthetic techniques (general anesthesia) and postoperative analgesia by titration of morphine. The day of surgery, we verified the checklist of the operatory room and we verified the presence of defibrillator. After the standard means of monitoring (ECG, pSO2, non invasive blood pressure and capnography), two peripheral venous lines of 18 G were taken. The patient was put in left lateral decubitus position.  We prescripted 500 ml of Ringer lactate over 30 minutes. Three minutes before induction of anesthesia, the preoxygenation was performed. The anesthetic induction was done after the installation of drapes, in rapid sequence by propofol (3mg/kg), Remifentanil (1μg/kg) and Rocuronium (0.6 mg / kg) with Sellick maneuver. Intubation was carried out by a tube of 7Fr. The anesthetic maintenance was given by continuous infusion of propofol (10 mg / kg / hour) and remifentanil (0.1 mcg / Kg/ min). After fetal extraction, we administered a prophylactic antibiotherapy (2g of Cefazolin). Oxytocin was administered at a dose of 5UI intravenous injection, and 10 IU in 500 ml infusion of saline. Intraoperative hemodynamic status was maintained stable with a systolic blood pressure of 110-100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 60-50 mm Hg and heart rate between 60 and 70 beats per minute. During the intervention, no desaturation was noted, end tidal p CO2 was maintained between 36 and 40 mm Hg and intrathoracic pressure did not exceed 25 mm Hg. Extubation was performed on the operating table. The postoperative period was uneventful with no electric changes on ECG and no bleeding. The postoperative analgesia was provided by paracetamol (15 mg/kg/6 hours) and morphine (5 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours). The patient leaved hospital 3 days after delivery and breastfeeding was proscribed.",human
"He has no history of addiction or alcohol consumption. The assessment of his cognitive function was normal. Genetic study cannot be realized because the unavailability of appropriate techniques in Tunisia.  He was described as an, emotionally cold person, and known for an increased interest for studies relative to leisure. Two years ago, suddenly and without triggering factor, the patient developed soliloquy, verbal aggressiveness to his parents, persecution, mystical talk and sleep disturbance. The physical examination found a patient moving in a wheelchair, having regard to functional impairment secondary to the severity of extrapyramidal syndrome in his limbs. His conscience was clear, without any confusion. There was rotatory nystagmus and dystonia of the hands and feet.  The psychiatric examination revealed, a young white man unable to maintain good contact, but who appeared anxious and suspicious. His speech is poor in content, barely understandable because of dysarthria. He reports a fuzzy; non systematized delusion: He was convinced that he was the prophet ""Noah"" and was charged with a divine mission: to change the world functioning. He is persecuted by strangers who collaborate with his parents to kill him. He experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.  Specialized neurological examination did not showed any clinical worsening. The physical examination was normal.  Investigations included routine blood tests (CBC, blood sedimentation reaction (BSR), liver and renal function assessments, serum electrolytes, an electroencephalogram, which were normal. MRI showed signal abnormalities in the central gray nucleus (basal ganglia) which was similar to those observed in the MRI practiced five years ago. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood lactate levels were normal. We prescribed amisulpiride in small doses (300mg/day) combined with a benzodiazepine (Lorazépam: 7,5 mg/day) and a corrector of extrapyramidal effects (biperiden hydrochloride). The use of higher doses of antipsychotic had led to as significant exacerbation of side effects. The partial remission could be observed under these doses, but quickly followed by a relapse during treatment, after 4 months, with exacerbation of positive symptoms and appearance of bizarre behavior.  This relapse had necessitated a switch to aripiprazole at a dose of 30 mg / day achieved gradually. This drug was well tolerated, and any neurological deterioration was found. This fact allowed us to decrease and stop antiparkinsonian drugs (L-Dopa and biperiden hydrochloride).  But we opted, after 6 weeks of treatment, for the addition of valproic acid (1500 mg/day) and clonazepam (4mg/day) such as a strategy of potentiating, given the persistence of positive symptoms, the anxiety and behavioral corollaries, such as distrust of his parents, the refusal of any food prepared by them, and insomnia.  Clinical improvement was very partial to afford acceptable interfamily adaptation, after 6 months of treatment. A third switch to olanzapine at a dose of 15 mg / day was made, while maintaining of valproic acid and clonazepam. This combination allowed a partial remission, allowing a best level of adaptation, it has been maintained. The clozapine has not been tried in this case.",human
"After 2009 there is a lack of genetic and hematologic control. The child attends a special school for blind with very high success. She is independent in everyday living, intellectually she is absolutely intact. In February 2012, she was diagnosed with intertrochanteric fracture of her left femur after a trauma and was referred to our department. On admission, the child was in an impaired general status, non-ambulatory on a wheelchair, with a plaster splint along the left lower limb. She was in tachycardia up to 140 b/min, BP at 100/65 mmHg, liver was palpated 10 cm below the ribs; the spleen on umbilical level, had hard consistency and smooth surface. No signs of intracranial hypertension and meningoradicular irritation were detected. Ambulation was impossible. The left lower limb was fixed in an abduction and external rotation contracture. Each attempt for a passive movement in the left hip joint was extremely painful. AP and lateral X-rays of the left femur demonstrated intertrochanteric fracture with a slight varus deformity. The distal femur showed typical for the disease metaphyseal defect in a funnel form of an Erlenmeyer flask. Skeletal X-rays demonstrated typical diffuse sclerosis without differentiation between cortical and spongious bone, affecting skull, pelvis, spine, thorax and upper limb bones. The preoperative hematologic investigation showed severe anemia with Hb 62 g/l, Htc 0.21, platelets 33.10 on 9/l, fibrinogen 6,2 g/l., without any other hematologic impairment. We performed preoperative substitution therapy with erythrocyte concentrate, plasma and platelets concentrate in sterile reanimation conditions. Operative treatment was performed on 20th of February 2012 with Hb 105 g/l, Htc 0,32, platelets 73.10 on 9 /l. Based on AO principles, we decided to perform surgical open reduction of the femoral fracture and fixation with a stable metal osteosynthesis. We used the technique with 120° LCP (Locking Compression Plate) Pediatric hip 5 mm. As we expected, the technical application of the synthesis was difficult due to bone hardness. We used a drill motor with a low speed and high torque, also brand new original steel drill bits. These bits were frequently replaced during the formation of the proximal three holes. Drill holes were inserted for a short distance with constant saline irrigation. Making of each hole took approximately 20 minutes. Perforation of the diaphysis for placement of the distal screws of the plate was not so difficult as was in the femoral neck because we used different, especially prepared for the case, diamond drill bits. These diamond drill bits were too short for the femoral neck length and could fit only for the diaphyseal holes. Duration of operation was 2 hours and 25 minutes with intraoperative blood loss of 270 ml. During proximal screws application appeared additional fissures in the femoral neck. They were detected on postoperative X-rays. These fissures did not compromise the stability of synthesis and the following bone consolidation. The early postoperative period was uneventful and standard antibiotic prophylactic was performed. Kinesitherapy with active movements was started on the first postoperative day. The child was gradually verticalized during the first postoperative week. Education in guided walking was started with a stable walker according to a special physiotherapy program, adapted for blind patients. Treatment continued with substitution therapy for the accompanying aplastic anemia by paediatric hematologist. A new physiotherapy course was performed for education in crutch walking after the third postoperative month. After the sixth month the child walks independently outside home only with a cane. On the X-rays in March 2013 (1 year postoperatively) we see consolidated fracture with a normal femoral neck-shaft angle. Lower leg length discrepancy is below 0.5 cm. Range of motion in the operated hip joint is: active flexion — 90°, extension — 5°, abduction — 30° The patient is painless and her gait substantially improved. The child returned to her specialized for blind school for the new school year.",human
"No history of scrotal pain, no bleeding from any other part of his body, no weight loss, no chronic cough, no noticeable fever or drenching night sweats. He was not a known diabetic or sickle cell disease patient. He had been taking oral sildenafil intermittently for 2 years to enhance sexual performance. The patient had a positive history of unprotected sexual intercourse with current and previous girlfriends. His father and elder sister were known hypertensives. He drank alcoholic beverages occasionally but was a lifelong non-smoker.  On examination, he was not in any obvious respiratory or painful distress, not pale, anicteric, afebrile to touch, acyanosed, no digital clubbing, no significant peripheral lymph node enlargement, and no dependent oedema. There were no signs of Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, or systemic sclerosis. He was conscious and alert, well oriented in time, place and person, scoring 10/10 on the abbreviated mental test score. He had no obvious focal neurologic deficits. His arterial walls were thickened and locomotor brachialis was present. Radiofemoral delay and renal bruits were absent. His blood pressure was 200/120 mmHg. The apex beat was at the 6th left intercostal space, lateral to the mid-clavicular line, heaving. The first, second and fourth heart sounds were present, all of normal intensity with no murmurs heard. The respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute. Respiratory system examination revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal examination was normal. Genito-urinary system examination including prostate examination was also normal. A diagnosis of severe hypertension and haematospermia was made. Investigation results included a full blood count that revealed a haematocrit of 34% while other parameters were within the normal range. Serum chemistry showed increased urea levels (urea 11.5 mmol/l), and elevated creatinine (300/mol/l). His lipid profile revealed mildly elevated LDL cholesterol (3.4 mmol/l) whiles other lipid parameters were normal. His fasting blood sugar was normal. Immunological testing showed no evidenced of HIV or tuberculosis. Radiography of the chest showed cardiomegaly with left ventricular preponderance but no evidence of aortic coarctation. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with increased P-terminal force (left atrial enlargement), T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, V5 and V6, left ventricular hypertrophy (Sokolow Lyon voltage criteria SV1 + RV5 = 41 mm). Dipstick urinalysis showed trace glycosuria but no protein or blood. Urine microscopy revealed 0 - 3 pus cells per high power field but showed no casts. There was no significant bacterium growth on urine culture. Seminal fluid analysis revealed a brownish gelatinous fluid with a volume of 2.5 mL, pH 8.5 (7.2 - 7.8), numerous red blood cells, 0 - 5 pus cells per high power field, the spermatozoa count 10.2 x 10 6 ml with 30% being actively motile, sluggishly motile 10%, non-motile 60%, normal morphology 60 %, abnormal morphology 40%. Seminal fluid culture did not have any significant yields. Fundoscopy was not done. Renal ultrasound scan, echocardiogram, prostate scan and prostate specific antigen were also ordered for but were not done on account of financial constraints.  The patient was admitted and counseled on his clinical condition, lifestyle modification and DASH (dietary approach to stop hypertension) diet. His blood pressure was lowered gradually, over several days, with oral nifedipine control release tabs, tabs moduretic, and lisinopril and he discharged home after 2 weeks at which time his blood pressure was 150/100 mm Hg. An appointment for follow-up visit was made (cardiology and urology) for the following week. In follow-up visits, he complained that when his blood pressure was measured outside the hospital, it was significantly less than the values obtained at the hospital. He also had the problem of his sexual partners running scared and avoiding him once they discover the haematospermia. Some weeks after being on regular anti-hypertensives, the haematospermia resolved completely.  He was however lost to follow-up, as his family members convinced him that his problems had been a ""spiritual attack"" and he resolved to seek further treatment at a church. About three months after last visit, he is said to have suffered a stroke while still at the church (this information was gotten from one of his relations as we made attempts to contact him). He is yet to be seen or heard from since.",human
"Case presentation 2: a 21-year-old male suffered isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. Patient in this case wanted early return to the work and also on CT scan a torsional deformation was seen on the fracture fragments. Hence the decision to do open reduction was made. Incision designing and access ad procedure was carried out as described. Access was satisfactory and 2 miniplates were placed and fixation achieved. Surgical procedure: both the above-mentioned patients were treated under general anaesthesia. Thiopentone sodium was used for induction and patients were intubated nasally. Oral cavity was kept free to achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and achieve the occlusion. Isoflurane and/or sevoflurane were used for maintenance. Surgical site and incision line were marked with a marking ink before commencing the procedure. Thereafter the marked line was infiltrated using lidocaine with adrenaline in 1:1000 concentrations. Incision remains the key of this approach as aesthetics has been given prime importance to the designing of this surgical access. Care has to be taken that incision follows the curvature of the angle of the mandible and suture line has to be visualized beforehand such that it is hidden completely in the shadow of the angle. Incision can be said to be combination of postramal Hind's incision and submandibular Risdon's incision but to the fact that it remains closer to the angle of the mandible, around 1 cm away from the bony landmark completely in the shadow of the mandible. Sharp incision with a 15 number blade is imperative to avoid any jagged incision line. In the first stroke only skin and subcutaneous tissue should be visible and skin flaps hold tightly away with skin hooks, which gives clear view of the subcutaneous tissue. Platysma muscle once seen can be dissected easily with a pair of scissors and blade with care that the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia is left undisturbed. Further careful progression and perhaps the most challenging step is dissecting through the deep cervical fascia which is important because the facial nerve, facial artery and facial vein will be lying deep to the fascia and hence absolute care has to be taken while incising the deep fascia. Immediately after incising the deep fascia, it is of utmost importance to identify the facial nerve with the nerve stimulator and retracting it in the upper flap. Subsequently, facial artery and vein should be identified, and if necessary, should be ligated and retracted to expose the underlying pterygo-masseteric sling. Once the pterygo-masseteric sling is visible then it becomes fairly easy procedure, whereby sharp incision on the sling can be given to expose the mandibular angle and this plane is fairly avascular with not much bleeding. Once the angle is exposed, fracture fragments can be easily manipulated to achieve reduction. Miniplates can be placed thereafter and fixation achieved. After irrigating the surgical site, closure is achieved in layers to define anatomic spaces. Great care was taken to achieve skin closure wherein subcutaneous horizontal mattress suturing was done to achieve the skin approximation which gives excellent post-operative scar. In both the treated cases, no suture tracks were noticed and a linear scar within the mandibular angle shadow was seen which was almost inconspicuous at the conversational distance.",human
"This lesion extended throughout the right mandibular crest and had been evolving for 1 month, according to the patient. The neurological examination revealed a unilateral labial-chin hypoaesthesia suggestive of malignancy. The craniofacial CT scan examination revealed an infiltration of the right lateral mandibular soft tissues associated with a poorly-limited osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest in relation to the floating tooth 45. It was associated with bilateral multiple lymph nodes (submandibular, supraclavicular and jugulo-carotid), the largest of which measured 20 mm.  A biopsy was performed. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations led to the conclusion that the tumour is a large B-cell lymphoma of the mandibular gingiva. Histologically, there were large tumour cells having clear and abundant cytoplasm with nuclei showing several marked atypias. The mitoses and the apoptotic bodies were quite numerous. The tumour was the site of important necrotic changes. In immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells strongly and diffusely expressed CD45 and CD20. They did not express CD3 and CK.  The patient was referred to the onco-haematology department where a chemotherapy-based treatment was initiated. She showed a clear improvement in her condition after the first cycles. Second case: a 16-year-old male patient with acute articular rheumatism and a history of erysipelas at the age of 7 years was hospitalized in the General Surgery Department because of a deterioration of his general condition. Originally, the patient suffered from epigastralgia, vomiting and an influenza state for which he had a symptomatic treatment. This was aggravated by a progressive onset of pain in the right iliac fossa with diarrhea-like transit disorders.  He was referred to our department to manage a left mandibular swelling with a suspected abscess of dental origin. The extraoral clinical examination revealed the presence of palpable left cervical lymphadenopathy with normal mouth opening. The intraoral examination showed an extensive gingival mass ranging from teeth 34 to 37 with terminal dental mobilities evolving for 3 weeks. On the neurological examination, the patient described a sensation of hypoaesthesia along the path of the left inferior alveolar nerve. The radiological examination revealed the presence of a bone destruction involving teeth furcation in the left molar region.  The abdominal CT scan evoked a tumoural mass of the ileocecal junction associated with a peritoneal carcinomatosis as well as multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which measured 31*21mm. The biological analyzes showed a significant increase in CRP values at 117 and in LDH at 789 (Table 1), indicating the existence of a biological inflammatory syndrome and tissue damage in the body. HIV serology was negative. In this context, an association between the oral lesion and the abdominal tumour was suspected, suggesting a cancer of lymphomatous origin.  A biopsy of the oral lesion was performed and the patient was surgically operated for his abdominal tumour in the general surgery department. The results of the anatomopathological examinations were in agreement with our suspicion. It was a Burkitt lymphoma with primary abdominal and secondary oral localisations. Histologically, there was a lymphomatous proliferation of diffuse architecture consisting of small to medium lymphocytes, basophilic cytoplasm with too many mitoses. In the immunohistochemical study, the lymphocytes were of phenotype B expressing markers CD20 (+), CD10 (+) and heterogeneous Bcl6. The tumour proliferation index Ki67 was 100%.  The postoperative follow-up was straightforward and the patient was referred to the onco-haematology department where a chemotherapy treatment was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient died one month later.",human
"He had a positive history of alcohol consumption (an average of 4 bottles of beer per day for 40 years) but stopped drinking 6 years after onset of his symptoms. He also stopped attending social gatherings. He had associated lipoma on the right thigh. He is a known diabetic with hypertensive heart disease on medications. His concerns were both cosmetic and functional. Although the burden was enormous, he was unaware of the availability of aesthetic surgery in our setting till he opened up to a radiologist (during a routine investigation) who refereed him to the plastic surgery clinic. Examination showed an obese looking elderly man in no obvious distress but with a moody affect. His weight was 123 kg and the height was 1.8 metres with a BMI of 38 kg/m 2. His waist circumference was 145 cm compared to the normal for males which is 102 cm. Abdominal girth was 141 cm at the umbilicus and 151 cm at the point of maximal enlargement which is 20 cm below the umbilicus. Musculo-skeletal examination showed bilateral knee tenderness without swelling or crepitus. He also had bilateral gynecomastia and lipoma of the right proximal thigh. A diagnosis of truncal obesity in an elderly man with bilateral gynecomastia, early bilateral knee osteoarthritis, hypertension and diabetes was made and patient was worked up for surgery. The ultrasound of the abdominal wall showed variable thickness with the upper quadrants measuring between 7 and 10 cm while the lower quadrants showed a thickness of about 14 cm on the left and 20 cm on the right. The intra-abdominal fat was also sonologically significant. No organ pathology was demonstrated. Laboratory investigations including serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine, fasting blood sugar, complete blood count, serum protein, serum lipids, liver function test and echocardiography, were done and were all within normal ranges. Patient was reviewed by both the cardiologist and the anesthesiologist and certified fit independently. He was counseled and informed consent obtained for abdominoplasty plus or minus liposuction. Liposuction was later excluded to shorten anaesthesia time and reduce the risk of complications because of his age and co-morbidities. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was used after epidural anesthesia failed. About 1.7 litres of Hunstad fluid was also infiltrated essentially for hemostasis and hydro-dissection. Traditional incision for conventional abdominoplasty was used and the protuberant infra-umblical tissue was excised weighing about 8.4 kg. The rectus sheath was plicated in two rows, the umbilicus transposed and the wound closed over two redivac drains, the left in the lower flank and the right in the upper flank. The estimated blood loss was 750 ml and he was transfused two pints of sedimented cells intra-operatively. Post-operative complications included blood transfusion reaction, surgical site infection with partial wound dehiscence. There was periumblical sinus discharging lipoid exudates. All the observed post operative events resolved on wound dressings with povidone iodine and antibiotics. The patient had an amazing improvement in the quality of life and eventual return to his business and social life style. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 are different views of images of the patient that shows his pre and post operative looks. He currently walks without a walking stick, drives his car and could use plain trousers and dress corporate, which were previously impossible. He was advised to continue with alcoholic abstinence and dietary control. A year post abdominoplasty, he weighed 116 kg with a BMI of 35.8 kg/m 2, his waist girth and the abdominal girth at the umblical level were 112 cm and 123 cm respectively. The point of maximal enlargement with a circumference of 125 cm located 10 cm below the umbilicus post-operatively compared to a circumference of 151 cm located at 20 cm below the umbilicus pre-operatively. The post operative ultrasound of the abdominal wall showed variable thickness in a range of 1.3 - 4.4 cm.",human
"On follow-up, there were no improvements in strength and symptoms and hence was posted for soft tissue reconstruction of the right upper limb with a tendon transfer. The tendon of flexor carpi radialis was harvested and attached to tendon of extensor digitorum communis and tendon of palmaris longus was harvested and attached to tendon of extensor pollicis longus. After the surgery, the right forearm was placed in a plaster cast for 3 weeks. On removal of plaster cast, he visited for rehabilitation in the physical therapy department with the complaints of pain over the wrist joint and difficulty in holding objects between thumb and fingers of the right hand. Character of pain was dull aching; tingling over the distal forearm, along with numbness and paraesthesia in the palm (numerical pain rating scale: 6/10). Scar was present over the dorsal and volar aspect of the distal forearm. The range of motion has been depicted in Table 1. Elbow, wrist, thumb muscle strength examination according to medical research council was carried out (1/5: wrist and thumb extensors, 3/5: elbow supinators and pronators, wrist and thumb flexors, 4/5: elbow flexors and extensors). All superficial and deep sensations were intact. Functional outcome by patient-specific functional scale revealead score 2/10 strength duration curve revealed the status of denervation. Four weeks of rehabilitation was carried out with each week adding a different component to the treatment. Rehabilitation consisted of faradism under pressure with a surged duration of 1 second and surge interval of 3 seconds with intensity enough to produce visible contractions with passive movement of wrist joint for 10 repetitions, scar tissue immobilization as an adjunct to stretching. The duration of treatment was 2 hours; this protocol was followed for one week. The patient was advised for dynamic cock-up splint for maintaining the position of joints. Ultrasound with 3 MHZ for 7 minutes followed by hot fomentation and wrist joint mobilization was executed for an increasing range of motion. Stimulation to wrist and finger extensors with intermediate galvanic current passive movements were incorporated to improve the muscle re-education. This protocol was carried out for one week. On the 1 st day of rehab along with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and joint mobilization, resistance training was initiated for wrist flexors and extensors, forearm supinator, and pronators with the help of resistance devices with 3 seconds hold for 15 repetitions. Different designed objects were used to improve the grip function. On the 21 st day of rehab, EMS parameters were switched to faradic current for reeducation. Strengthening exercises were continued and progression by increasing the intensity and duration based on clinical improvements. Post rehabilitation on 28 th day there were significant improvements in parameters of pain intensity (NPRS 2/10), muscle strength (3+/5), range of motion (Table 1), patient-specific functional scale score (7/10) and strength-duration curve showed the status of innervations.",human
"No antecedent trauma to the head or ingestion of drugs or herbal preparations. His haemoglobin genotype was unknown. He presented to a private hospital where he was admitted and given subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for two days on suspicion of stroke. His clinical state improved briefly and then deteriorated, necessitating referral to Federal Medical Centre, Owerri.  General physical examination findings on admission were normal. Neurological examination showed a conscious child, cooperative with normal comprehension of speech but expressive aphasia, right sided facial weakness, no signs of meningeal irritation, normal muscle bulk, hypertonia in both upper and lower limbs, weakness of the limbs (power grade 3 on the Rt. sided limbs and grade 4- on the Lt. side), hyperreflexia bilaterally in both upper and lower limbs, absent abdominal reflexes, sustained ankle clonus and positive Babinski sign bilaterally. There were signs of incoordination (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia). Findings on examination of other systems were normal. Admitting diagnosis was encephalopathy 2oC encephalitis with differential diagnoses of space-occupying lesion (SOL) with raised intracranial pressure (RICP) and sickle cell CNS infarctive crisis. Investigations done included: haemoglobin genotype, Full Blood Count (FBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Random Blood Sugar (RBS), Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), blood film for Malaria Parasite (MP), Serum Electrolytes, Urea & Creatinine (SEUC), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain, Clotting profile with Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT). Results of investigations are shown in Table 1 and figures below. The MRI brain showed multifocal areas of irregular abnormal signal intensities in the parietal and occipital regions suggestive of multiple subacute cerebral infarction. Following further review of patient’s clinical features, investigation results and MRI brain, the diagnosis was modified to Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).  Due to vomiting on admission, patient was commenced initially on intravenous fluids for 24hrs and intravenous dexamethasone 4mg 6hrly for 48hrs. By the second day on admission, vomiting had subsided and patient commenced oral feeds and tabs prednisolone 20mg two times daily (1mg/kg/d). An intravenous antibiotic (Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg/d) was commenced while awaiting FBC result. An antiheliminthic (tab Albendazole 400mg stat) was administered. Physiotherapy was also instituted.  Three days into admission, patient had become emotionally labile (cried easily when spoken to and was frustrated by his inability to talk) but general and neurological examination findings remained same. He received tabs Artemeter-Lumefantrin (480/80) due to a positive blood film for MP. By the seventh day on admission, remarkable improvement was noted. Patient’s speech had become audible though poorly fluent, and power had improved to grade 4 - on the right side similar to the left side. Gait was broad based and ataxic and he could not tandem walk. This improvement was steady and sustained. By the 4 th week on admission, power in all limbs had increased to grade 4 + but there was still subtle Rt. facial weakness, hyperreflexia, weakness of the hand muscles (Rt. > Lt.) with impaired fine motor function (handwriting, dressing). Signs of incoordination also persisted and increased appetite, weight gain of 6kg (35kg to 41kg) and “moon face” were noted. However, Blood Pressure (BP) (90/60mmHg) and vital signs (temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) remained normal. Treatment was then modified with reduction of tabs prednisolone to 20mg on alternate days and addition of tabs cyclophosphamide 50mg on alternate days to synchronize with steroid-off days. Patient and his mother were counselled on the nature of the diagnosis, the possible prolonged therapy required, the possibility of residual deficits and the need for continued physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Due to the absence of trained occupational therapists in our locality, patient was provided with a small soft ball to squeeze frequently and advised to pick grains of rice from a tray repeatedly at home. He was to copy words, figures or diagrams from textbooks many times a day. All these were to improve his fine motor function especially handwriting. He was subsequently discharged and given weekly follow-up appointments in our neurology clinic. He was monitored for side effects of the immunosuppressive treatment with weekly FBC, ESR and BP monitoring and these remained normal all through the follow-up period. Subsequent follow-up visits (weeks 5-9) showed steady improvement with normal power returning to the limbs grossly, improving fine motor function (handwriting, performance of activities of daily living) and resolution of facial weakness, expressive aphasia and signs of upper motor neuron lesion. However, increased appetite, weight gain (41kg-53kg) and signs of incoordination remained. Further weekly tapering of prednisolone was done (10mg alternate days to 4mg alternate days to 2mg alternate days). By the 12 th week following diagnosis, hand grasp had become normal and handwriting legible and speed of writing good. Weight dropped to 42kg and he no longer had “moon face”. He resumed schooling with unimpaired participation. However, signs of incoordination such as dysmetria (past pointing) and impaired tandem walk persisted. Both drugs were finally stopped (after 3 months) and a repeat Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requested. Due to financial constraints and patient’s remarkable recovery, reimaging was delayed. Patient was seen again seven months later, about one year after admission and by then those signs of incoordination that persisted after discharge had all disappeared and patient was completely neurologically normal.  A repeat brain MRI done at this time (one year after onset of illness) showed marked improvement with complete resolution of the some of the cortical lesions in the parietal and occipital regions bilaterally and residual hyperintensity in the periventricular and supraventricular cerebral white matter bilaterally involving the parieto-occipital regions predominantly; there were no new lesions.",human
"Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. All microbiological infectious investigations, especially tuberculosis, were negative. He had hypergammaglobulinemia of 21.9 g/l. Other immunological tests were otherwise negative. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed finding a hyperkinetic left ventricle, a small dilation of right ventricle with PAPs 48 mmHg and an intrapulmonary shunt revealed by contrast test. The bronchial endoscopy showed an inflammatory bronchial tree and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concluded to lymphocytic alveolitis with a ratio CD4 (helper T cells) over CD8 (suppressor T cells) (CD4/CD8) of 0.5. The bronchial biopsies showed inflammatory bronchial mucosa without any specificities. Despite the absence of Koch's bacillus in sputum analysis, we decided to begin a trial anti-tuberculosis treatment because of the severity of lung involvement added to high endemicity of tuberculosis in our country. Two weeks later, the patient presented an allergic skin reaction. As no recovery's signs were noted, we decided to stop the treatment. Corticosteroids were initiated considering idiopathic diffuse infiltrating pneumonitis. Unfortunately, the patient did not show any improvement and the chest scan performed after 27 days of treatment showed worsening interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis.  Clinically, he required high flow oxygen (14 l/mn) alternating with non invasive ventilation sessions. Histological examination of the open lung's biopsy then performed showed diffuse lung parenchyma damage. It was altered by a mutilating fibrosis that was widening the alveolar septa. This fibrosis contained an abundant inflammatory infiltrate made of lymphocytes, plasmocytes and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils. Epithelioid and giant cell granulomas were also observed without either caseous or fibrinoïd necrosis. This mutilating fibrosis induced an enlargement of some alveoli resulting in the formation of a honeycomb aspect. Fibroblastic foci were also noticed. Some alveoli contained hyaline membranes that were sometimes incorporated in the septa. There were no mineral particles observed with polarized light. Regarding these features, the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) associated to lesions of sarcoidosis or berylliosis with aspects suggestive of an acute exacerbation was retained.  Since sarcoidosis was not very likely according to CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL, we investigated risk factors for chronic beryllium disease, particularly occupation's patient history. He was working as glassblower in an artistic glass factory since six months. Further to our request, occupational department's experts inspected the workplace and confirmed beryllium existence in compounds of colored glass. After confirmation of CBD, steroids were maintained and oxygen requirement slowly decreased. The patient was finally discharged at home after 55 days steroid treatment with long term oxygen therapy (2 l/minute). Pulmonary function tests at discharge showed a severe restrictive impairement. Steroid doses were slowly decreased and stopped after 10 months. A pre-transplant assessment was also made. One year after discharge, the patient felt somewhat better and pulmonary function tests showed a slight improvement. The CT scan performed found a partial regression of lung consolidations and ground glass opacities, but increase of distortion signs, cavities appearance of which one filled by aspergilloma. He received oral voriconazole 200 mg per day during 3 months. After a two-year period from the date of CBD diagnosis, the patient was again admitted in ICU for ARF. An enhanced CT scan performed showed further deterioration of pulmonary parenchyma and pulmonary embolism with fatal issue.",human
"The blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg. Furthermore, the obstetric ultrasound showed a positive foetal cardiac activity. Laboratory test results showed 4+ proteinuria, hemoglobin at 13 g/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 290 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 193 IU/l, platelets count at 383000 /uL, total bilirubin at 37 mg/L and direct bilirubin at 21 mg/L. Elseways, the renal function and the prothrombin time (PT) were normal. We administered antihypertension drugs (a bolus dose of intravenous (IV) nicardipine and PO methyldopa: 500 mg every 8 hours), and the patient was started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. Considering the risk of a preterm delivery, she also received also betamethasone for fetal lung maturity. However, those symptomatic treatments were inefficient, so the decision was taken for immediate cesarean delivery indicated for maternal rescue.  Within 2 days of delivery, the patient installed an intense epigastric pain, the hemoglobin dropped to 9,1 g/dl, AST rose to 2809 IU/l and ALT to 2502 IU/l, platelets count decreased to 77000 /ul, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was at 1209 U/L, prothrombin time (PT) was at 61% and blood glucose level was normal. The renal function was also disturbed (serum creatinine increased to 16 mg/l and urea achieved 1,58 g/l). Then, based on all above, we diagnosed the patient with HELLP syndrome and she was immediately transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for suspicion of liver subcapsular hematoma complicating the HELLP syndrome. Arriving to the MICU, the patient still had the epigastric pain. The physical examination objectified a blood pressure at 130/90 mmHg, heart beats at 140 per minute, temperature at 37.1 o C, with sensitivity of the right hypochondrium and decreased breath sounds. The ultrasonic images showed a hyperechoic areas interesting different hepatic segments with massive hydrothorax. We completed paraclinical investigations by a thoraco-abdominopelvic CT, it objectified the absence of spontaneous hemorrhagic hyperdensity and the existence of diffuse hypodense plaques, poorly limited, not enhanced after injection, interesting all hepatic segments, more marked on the right hepatic lobe. The vascular permeability of the portal and subhepatic was preserved. Those CT images correspond to massive hepatic infarction. Otherwise, the CT scan also showed the presence of an intra-peritoneal and pleural effusions. Once the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome with massive hepatic infarction was confirmed, we continued to treat the patient with antihypertension drugs (PO nicardipine and PO methyl dopa), preventive anticoagulant treatment and proton pump inhibitor. During the surveillance, the patient installed a polypnea with an aggravation of pleural effusion on chest X-ray, she became febrile and the biological features worsened (hemoglobin = 4,6 g/dl; platelets count = 20000 /ul; WBC = 26000 /ul; CRP = 340 mg/l; albumin = 16 g/l, prothrombin time (PT) = 50%). Then, the patient received antibiotics (4g piperacillin / 0.5g tazobactam given every six hours for 14 days and 15 mg/kg amikacin per day as a single daily dose for 3 days), she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and seven units of platelets concentrates, she also received albumin 20 g/day with the pleural effusion drainage. Within 6 days, the patient has improved clinically, liver function tests began to downtrend by postoperative day 5, the biological results were normalized within 11 days, the damaged hepatic areas stayed stable for 15 days as shown by a control CT scan. So, at day 17 the patient was discharged with maintained follow-ups.",human
"He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g. Back home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed ""bat wings"" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.  On the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.  The oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.  Mutation analysis of peripheral blood samples of the neonate revealed a mutation at the homozygous status of MYO5B gene.  The baby died, after 97 days of life, of septic shock and multiple organ failure.",human
"Furthermore there was a leptomeningeal spread not only intracranially but in the spinal canal as well. The patient underwent two operation procedures. Firstly, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (Medtronic PS Medical) was placed to deal with hydrocephalus and then a radical resection of the tumor was performed; nevertheless, some small tumor remnants were left behind because they could not be safely removed. The postoperative period was complicated with prolonged stay in the pediatric intensive care unit due to postoperative neurological deterioration. During his stay in the ICU the patient experienced an episode of cardiac arrest and a permanent internal defibrillator was implanted through the right subclavian vein. Finally he was discharged from the neurosurgical department with severe left hemiparesis and he was further treated with high-dose chemotherapy. In the following years he underwent four revision surgeries, which included several revisions of the distal part and the introduction of a new proximal catheter at the opposite lateral ventricle, due to VP malfunction caused by peritoneal malabsorption.  In the last operation, the distal catheter was implanted to the right internal jugular vein. At the age of 4 years old the child presented to the emergency department with deteriorating level of consciousness and vomiting. The shunt was tapped and demonstrated increased pressure with good proximal flow and absence of distal runoff. A computer tomography (CT) scan revealed ventricles dilatation and periventricular edema Figure 1. Moreover an ultrasound imaging of the neck veins revealed bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis.  Due to lack of alternative solutions, a decision was made to implant the distal catheter in the right atrium through the left subclavian vein with the help of the interventional cardiologist of the hospital. The peripheral catheter was introduced percutaneously using the Seldinger technique. Tunneling was done up to the clavicle region and a stab wound was performed at the puncture site. The subclavian vein was punctured using a 21 G needle and a 0,018"" guide wire was introduced. Through that, a 4-French sheath was introduced and the wire was withdrawn. Afterwards, a new guide wire 0,035"" was introduced and the sheath was also withdrawn. In order to achieve gradual vein dilation and to avoid injury of the vessel two consecutive sheaths of 6 and 7 French accordingly were used. The latter was a peel-away sheath Figure 2. The wire and the introducer were withdrawn and the distal catheter was introduced through the peel away dilator Figure 3. Placement of the catheter in the right atrium was confirmed with an intra-operative x-ray with the C-arm. The dilator was peeled away and the wound was closed in a standard manner. The patient made an uneventful recovery with no post-operative complications and he was discharged free of symptoms of increased intracranial pressure a few days later. At one year follow-up the child is without symptoms of hydrocephalus and the CT scan shows a normal ventricular system with both catheters in place Figure 4.",human
"There were no Babinski sign and no systemic signs. Laboratory tests showed increased CPK level (20,591 IU/L), positive C-reactive protein (15 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (13 at the first hour). The dosage of anti-parietal cell and anti-SRP antibodies were positives while the dosage of anti-JO1 and antinuclear antibodies were negatives except the insignificant presence of anti-SSA antibodies. Infectious serologies (HIV 1 and 2, HTLV 1 and 2, hepatitis A, hepatitis C, trichinosis, syphilis, Lyme, streptococci, Coxsackie virus, Echovirus) were negatives. We noted the presence of toxoplasmosis IgG (0.1 IU/ml) but no IgM. Epstein Barr virus serology revealed previous infection and we related the presence of anti-HBs antibodies (402 IU/l) to a previous immunization. The endocrine tests were normal (TSH, ACTH, estradiol, IGF1, prolactin, FSH, LH). The standard short synacthen test was negative. Cardiac ultrasound performed on the 17th September was normal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and thighs showed hypersignal of pelvis and thighs muscles indicate an inflammatory myopathy. The electromyogram showed pure myogenic pattern. We performed a surgical muscle biopsy at the left thigh which revealed muscular alterations related to inflammatory myopathy. The diagnosis of anti-SRP antibody myopathy was done. Following the worsening of the muscle weakness, the patient was readmitted on the 05th September. Laboratory tests showed persistent high CPK level (18721 IU/L), elevated transaminases with AST (about 10 times) and ALT (167 IU/l), normal serum electrolytes, positive C - reactive protein (15 mg/l) and increased fibrinogen level (4.37). She received a treatment based on Methylprednisolone at initial dose of 500 mg and two others doses of 250 mg and Intravenous Immunoglobulin to 2g/kg/treatment. The treatment was well tolerated clinically and biologically (post-Intravenous Immunoglobulin CPK level was 7435 IU/l) but there were no regression of the muscle weakness. She has been discharged on the 12th October with corticosteroid and associated treatment. Observation 2: Ms. N.C. Senegalese 35 year old (in 2016) with past history of anti-SRP antibody myopathy diagnosed in 2012 and normal delivery. She was hospitalized from the 10th to 29th April 2015 for a muscle pain and weakness of the lower limbs started 5 months prior to hospitalization. Indeed seven months after the delivery, she has been re admitted for a muscle pain and weakness of the lower limbs leading to sleep deprivation. She has stopped the treatment during pregnancy without significant change. Clinical exam found muscle paresis of both lower limbs with muscular strength quoted at 1/5 proximally and 4/5 distally. The knee jerk, ankle jerk reflexes and idiomuscular response were absents bilaterally as well as the Babinski sign. Laboratory tests had showed high CPK level (17,651 IU/l), elevated transaminases with AST (about 10 times) and (ALT 140 IU/l), positive C-reactive protein (36mg/l), low creatinine level (75 mg/dL) and normal serum electrolyte. Controlled laboratory tests done in January 2013 showed: very high CPK level (12,750 IU/l) with positive C-reactive protein 36 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 26 at first hour. The dosage of anti-SRP antibodies was positive while antinuclear antibodies and anti-JO1 antibodies were negative. Infectious serologies (HIV 1, 2, hepatitis B) were negative. The hormonal tests were normal (TSH, ACTH, prolactin, FSH, LH) as well as cardiac ultrasound. The electromyogram showed a pure myogenic pattern. She received Solumedrol with initial dose of 500 mg and two others doses of 250 mg. The treatment has been well tolerated clinically and biologically, without muscle paresis improvement.

"Patient also denied any histories of allergy to food or drugs as well as history of family with the same complain. History of immunization was unknown. The patient had been treated at the local hospital in multiple occasions with both oral medication and ointments, but the complaints did not show any improvement. The patient was in an otherwise healthy condition with a body weight of 64 kg. Dermatological examination of the right knee showed erythematous plaque with verrucous surface, elevated edge and erythematous base accompanied by crusting. Left dorsum pedis showed erythematous macules and plaques accompanied by crusting. The differential diagnosis of this patient included tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, lupus vulgaris, chromoblastomycosis, and neurodermatitis, with tuberculosis verrucosa cutis as the working diagnosis. Laboratory test showed leukocytosis (11,350/uL) while other results of complete blood test, blood sugar, and liver functions were within normal range. Examination of pus and skin scraping by Ziehl Nielsen staining did not reveal any acid-resistant bacilli (AFB). Skin scraping examination with 10% KOH revealed no hyphae, spores nor muriform bodies. There was no visible fungus growth in tissue culture with saboraud agar. Chest radiograph did not show any abnormalities. Mantoux test showed negative result (induration of 9 mm). Histopathological examination of skin tissue from the left knee showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis and diffuse lymphocytic and neutrophil inflammation infiltrate in the superficial dermis extending to the epidermis, perivascular areas, and the interstitial middle and deep dermis. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining did not show presence of fungal elements. The final conclusion of the histopathological examination was suppurative chronic inflammation which can be found in deep mycosis and cutaneous TB. Due to this inconclusive result, further tests in the form of M. tuberculosis culture with skin tissue sample, Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) test with ELISA method using blood sample, and examination of M. tuberculosis (MTb) with GeneXpert method using tissue sample, were carried out. MTb examination using GeneXpert method and culture after four weeks failed to demonstrate the presence and growth of M. tuberculosis, respectively. However, the result of IGRA examination was positive. Based on the history taking, physical examination, and supporting tests, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculosis verrucosa cutis and given category 1 antituberculosis therapy trial. Based on the 64 kg body weight of the patient, four tablets of fixed dose combination antituberculosis drugs each consisted 150 mg rifampicin, 75mg isoniazid, 275 mg etambuthol, and 400 mg pyrazinamide were given once daily for 4 weeks. In addition, B Complex tablet was also prescribed once daily. After 21 days of treatment, thinning of the plaque and significant improvement of the pruritus were observed. In addition, there were no adverse reactions reported by the patient. Therefore, the regimen was continued for two months before being converted to the maintenance phase in the third month. In the maintenance phase, two tablets of fixed combination drugs each consisted of 75 mg isoniazid dan 150 mg rifampicin were given. At the end of the six-month treatment, a significant improvement was evident.",human
"Examination revealed swollen right lower limb with dark discoloration from the toes to mid-thigh as in Figure 1. The leg was cold with weak popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses compared to the contralateral limb. Sensation was intact and power was zero. Systemic examination was unremarkable. A diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the right thigh secondary to Nicolau syndrome was made. Investigations done were full blood count (FBC), urea, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, INR and doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb. FBC results were normal. Urea and creatinine were elevated 13.5mmol/l and 242.2umol/l respectively. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were 997.7U/L and 115.6IU/L. International normalization ratio (INR) was 1.57. An emergency fasciotomy was done 24hrs after presentation after surgeons reviewed the patient and intra-op findings were osteofascial compartment bulging on first incision with free clear fluid and minimal bleeding as shown in Figure 2. Patient was then started on broad spectrum antibiotics; imipenem 250mg thrice a day (TDS) IV and metronidazole 200mg IV and analgesia, tramadol 25mg twice a day intramuscular (B.D IM). The acute kidney injury (AKI) was managed conservatively by restricting fluid intake and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs. AKI resolve after 5 days with urea and creatinine dropping to 3.36mmol/l and 37.26umol/l. ALT and AST also dropped to 64.1U/L and 180.3IU/l with albumin of 18.5g/l. However, there was no improvement in the perfusion of the right leg and foot two days after fasciotomy. A diagnosis of dry gangrene was made and patient was planned for a below knee amputation but parents denied consent. The parents continued being counselled on the need for an amputation. After 4 days post fasciotomy, patient started having spiking temperatures despite being on imipenem. The swelling worsened with intense pain in the right thigh and right thigh skin started developing blisters. A diagnosis of dry gangrene with superimposed wet gangrene was made 13 days after fasciotomy as indicated in Figure 3. Parents were counselled for an above knee amputation but consent was denied again. Patient developed convulsions which were attributed to raised body temperatures. The seizures were controlled by diazepam 7mg intravenous (I.V) stat. Four days later, the parents accepted for an above knee amputation (AKA) to be done. The AKA was done and intra-op findings were cooked muscles of the right thigh due to poor perfusion. Patient was then put on ceftriaxone, metronidazole and tramadol. The temperatures settled after the AKA. Wound was then exposed after 24hrs and daily cleaning was ordered. The patient was later discharge and she is currently undergoing occupational therapy sessions at the physiotherapy department as in Figure 4.",human
"On USS, an HP was diagnosed, with a single viable intrauterine foetus and a demised left adnexal foetus and she was referred to our hospital for further management. A systemic enquiry was done which was unremarkable with no constitutional symptoms. She did not have any significant gastro-intestinal and genitourinary symptoms. She had delivered vaginally in her two previous pregnancies and had not experienced any complications. She was HIV negative, had no previous history of treatment for sexually transmitted infections and had not been screened for cervical cancer before. She did not have any significant medical and surgical history. She was of sober habits, unemployed and stayed with her partner in rented accommodation in a high-density suburb and was not on medical insurance. Physical examination: she was fully conscious and hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 123/87 mmHg and a pulse rate of 90 beats per minute. Her temperature was 36.7 degrees Celsius, however, she felt hot to touch. She had mild central pallor. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. The uterus was not palpable above the symphysis pubis. She had bilateral adnexal fullness, no cervical motion tenderness and had no active vaginal bleeding or discharge. There were no significant findings in the respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Her hemogram revealed a neutrophilic leucocytosis of 18.3 with a normocytic anaemia (Hb 9.0, MCV 83.0). Management: we intended to take the patient for laparoscopy. However, due to theatre constraints we did a laparotomy. A Pfannestiel incision was fashioned and a pyoperitoneum of about 100 millilitres was encountered on entering the abdomen. We then did a midline incision to visualise all quadrants of the abdomen. A left-sided ruptured fimbrial ectopic pregnancy was noted and a left salpingectomy was done. An identifiable foetus was noted and not sent for histology. A ruptured appendix with a well-organised appendiceal abscess was also noted. The remnants of the appendix were minimal and all necrotic debris was removed. The rest of the abdomen was normal, with scanty fibrinous adhesions. A saline lavage was done prior to closure of the abdomen. Due to overwhelming necrosis, there was no appendix specimen to send for histology. Outcome: post-operatively, the patient was managed on intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, metronidazole and paracetamol and she recovered uneventfully. She was discharged on the fifth day post laparotomy. On follow-up review at two weeks patient was well and her scar was healing well. The pregnancy continued and was viable on USS at review, but the final outcome is still to be determined.",human
"A syndrome of inflammation (sedimentation rate (SV): 49 mm in the first hour, fibrinogen: 5.1 g/l, CRP: 86 mg/l), as well as liver cytolysis (ASAT: 348UI/L, ALAT: 49UI/L, GGT: 96UI/L, Alkaline phosphatases: 158UI/L, total bilirubin: 59 mg/l). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 1234UI/L, triglycerides 5.72 mmol/l (N: 0.35-1.7) and ferritinemia 2017 g/l (N: 30-400). Infectious balance is negative (blood cultures, serology of atypical germs, PCR of Herpes viridae, Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus 2(HSV2), Parvovirus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Human Herpesvirus (HHV6) and (HHV8), Sputum stain for Koch bacillus (BK) and gene-expert are negatives, coprocultures and PCR of gastrointestinal tract are negatives). The myelogram is rich with the presentation of very many images of hemophagocytosis, compatible with MAS. An axillary lymphadenopathy developed one week after the patient's admission, 1 cm x 1 cm in diameter, mobile, solid, painful; removal of the lymphadenopathy is carried out as an emergency procedure. The anatomopathological study revealed a modified and infiltrated architecture of an essentially mononuclear inflammatory element arranged in layers with a few giant cells and fibrosis of the lymph node pulp scattered with rare cells with enlarged nuclei with a prominent nucleolus and a clear cytoplasm that is fairly abundant and poorly limited in favor of scleroderodular LH. The immunohistochemical study found positive anti-CD 30 antibodies, anti MUM1 positive, anti CD15 negative and anti PAX 5 inconclusive antibodies. This result is compatible with LH bone marrow infiltration. The diagnosis of stage IVb scleroderodular LH is retained. For extension assessment and given the limited resources available in our context for a PET scan, a cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan shows mediastinal and left axillary lymph node involvement associated with homogenous hepato-splenomegaly and multiple effusions. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral serology are negative and the echocardiography shows an ejection fraction of 75%.

"There was no prior medical admission, no history of surgery and no significant medication or recreational drug use. He is currently a grade ten scholar. There was no known COVID-19 case contact, however recent travel to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior was noted (Table 1). Clinical findings On clinical examination the patient was ill looking with a blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, heart rate of 123 beats per minute and a temperature of 39.5°C. He was restless with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction. A generalized maculopapular rash was observed over the torso, upper back, limbs and palmar surface of the hands. The rash was non-tender, with erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis. The abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal with no jaundice, or lymphadenopathy. His cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no added sounds, a sinus tachycardia, a normal volume pulse and warm, well perfused peripheries. He had no meningism and there was no arthritis. Diagnostic assessment Diagnostic methods Prior to arrival to CHBAH the patient had received three days of ceftriaxone and intravenous (IV) paracetamol with no clinical improvement. Blood investigations showed a rising C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimers (Table 2). Blood and urine cultures remained negative. The lumbar puncture was normal (including viral panel) with a normal chest radiograph and abdominal sonar. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) performed revealed a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function. Three nasopharyngeal swabs sent for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative. Diagnosis and differentials An initial wide differential diagnosis of infections was considered: viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV); and bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis or malaria. Non-infectious differential diagnoses were also considered: Kawasaki like disease (KD) as well as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) were considered in view of the rash, sore throat, elevated ferritin, CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in association with neutrophilia. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered on account of fever, rash and low complement (C3, C4) levels. An elevated temperature, rising CRP, PCT, LDH, D-Dimer and ferritin levels with deranged liver function tests (LFT), suggested a diagnosis of MIS-C. Therapeutic intervention On admission, the patient was tachycardic with a mean arterial pressure of 64mmHg, with no clinical or biochemical indicators of end organ hypoperfusion. Intravenous fluid boluses of crystalloid were administered with no significant response in haemodynamic parameters. Fluid boluses were ceased and urine output and serum lactate levels were monitored as markers of tissue hypoperfusion. Inotropes and vasopressors were not initiated as part of initial management. Doxycycline was added as empiric cover for rickettsial disease and ceftriaxone was continued on day two. Hydrocortisone was commenced on admission but discontinued on day three due to concern for infection. A transient resolution of the fever coincided with steroid initiation, and a subsequent elevation in temperature was noted when the steroids were interrupted. On day four of admission, in light of an audible gallop rhythm, persistently low mean arterial pressures and newly elevated cardiac troponin-T levels, a repeat ECHO was performed, revealing an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% with global hypokinesia, four chamber dilation, moderate functional tricuspid and mitral regurgitation with a sliver of pericardial effusion. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started at a total dose of 120g (2g/kg) over 72 hours in conjunction with a dobutamine infusion and gentle diuresis to counter fluid overload. An IV methylprednisolone pulse of 500mg daily for three days was initiated with the IVIG on day five of admission. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and confirmed the presence of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein with in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing. A bone marrow aspirate and trephine (BMAT) revealed increased macrophage activity, but did not meet criteria for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Doxycycline and ceftriaxone were discontinued after four and seven days, respectively. Colchicine was added to cover for possible associated myopericarditis. Defervescence was noted on day six, accompanied by a downward trend in inflammatory markers, LDH and ferritin. Aspirin (300mg daily) and a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (60mg twice daily) were added in view of thrombotic risk. The patient improved clinically with no further temperature spikes and repeat ECHO revealed an improved EF of 45% on day seven. Inotropic support was weaned off on day seven. Prednisone 30mg daily was initiated on day eight after completion of methylprednisolone pulse. The patient was monitored for a further two days, and showed clinical improvement, with no further temperature spikes and/ or hypotensive episodes. There was almost complete resolution of the initial rash. His WCC, CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimers and ferritin were all on a downward trend and the LFT had normalized. The patient was discharged on day 12 on prednisone 20mg daily, aspirin 100mg daily, and colchicine 0,5mg twice daily (Table 1). Follow up and outcomes Mr. LN was reviewed 2 weeks later in the rheumatology outpatient clinic and was noted to have recovered fully with no residual symptoms. On examination there was complete resolution of the rash, with only few areas of residual hyperpigmentation. He had no tachycardia or signs of heart failure. A repeat ECHO showed an improvement in EF to 57%, without a pericardial effusion. The prednisone was weaned to 10mg daily and tapered down over the next four weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with no side effects noted. The patient returned to school and will be reviewed in the coming months. Informed consent Informed consent was obtained from the patient to use historical and clinical information as well as images avoiding identifiable features.",human
"Physical examination showed an acutely ill looking febrile patient with a temperature of 38.9°C, blood pressure of 120/70mmHg, a pulse of 92 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 24 cycles per minute. The rest of his physical examination was normal. His initial laboratory evaluation showed a leukocyte count of 7,090/µl of which 84.7% were neutrophils, a hemoglobin of 14.5g/dl, and platelet count of 89,000/µl. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and prothrombin time were prolonged by 15.2 and 5.3 seconds, respectively. A slightly elevated INR of 1.35, but a markedly elevated D-dimer of 224.6µg/ml (ref 0-0.5µg/ml) were observed. The renal biochemical parameters were normal except for creatinine of 1.5mg/dl. Apart from an AST of 223 IU/l and an ALT of 70IU/l, all other liver function tests were normal. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Other investigations are detailed in Table 1. Intravenous ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and parenteral artesunate were commenced. On subsequent review, the temperature was 39.2°C, pulse was 102 beats per minute, and there was tenderness on the right iliac fossa and suprapubic areas. Ciprofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone, and parenteral metoclopramide was added to control the vomiting which had persisted since admission. On the fourth day of admission, he complained of rhinorrhea. Further physical examination revealed a mildly inflamed pharynx with no significant regional lymph node enlargement. Pulse was 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 110/70mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 cycles per minute, and reduced breath sounds in the middle and lower zones. Chest X-ray showed perihilar patchy opacities worse on the right with few patchy opacities on the right upper and lower zones. With concern for a sub-optimally treated community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin was added for atypical pathogens. The following day, the temperature was noticed to be 40.5°C despite regular antibiotics. Pulse was 100 per minute, blood pressure was 130-170/60-100mmHg. The respiratory rate was 62 cycles per minute, and SpO 2 was 79-81% while breathing ambient air. Percussion notes were dull on the right lower zone, and breath sounds were vesicular with a mix of coarse crackles and rhonchi on the right lower zone. A repeat laboratory evaluation showed worsening microscopic hematuria, thrombocytopenia, and a leukocytosis of 11,720/µl. Blood film for malaria parasite detection was repeatedly negative. Supplemental intranasal oxygen at 4L per minute was administered. Loratadine and amlodipine were added, and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory support. In the ICU, the dyspnea improved with oxygen therapy by face mask. SpO 2 on oxygen therapy ranged between 93% and 97%. Respiratory rate was 26 cycles per minute, pulse was 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 135/76mmHg. However, he continued to have high-grade fever, tachypnea and developed diarrhea with dark-colored stools over the next 3 days while in the ICU. On the 10th day of admission, a positive result for viral hemorrhagic fever screening using real-time RNA polymerase chain reaction panel detecting the dengue virus was obtained. Supportive management was continued. After 16 days of conservative management, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home from the hospital. He was established to have a normal blood pressure with no medication after a year of follow up.",human
"On the day of her admission, the patient was in general condition scored WHO 2, the blood pressure was 132/80 mm Hg with a heartbeat rate of 105 beats/min, and her temperature was 38.9°C. On physical examination, palpation of the right hypochondrium was very painful, the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood laboratory tests found: Blood hemoglobin at 10.1 g/dl, hyper leukocytosis at 13,370 elm/ml with a predominance of polynuclear cells (8300 elm/ml), without lymphopenia (3400 elm/ml), a platelet count at 276,000 elm/ml, hepatic transaminases were slightly elevated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 76 IU/ml and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 72 IU/ml, normal hemostasis with a prothrombin ratio of 87%, KCT = 32.1 '' (t = 30 '') and an International Normalized Ratio of 1.10. An abdominal computerized tomography (CT-scan) performed before admission (9 days before) confirmed the presence of a giant sub-capsular hepatic hematoma, developed at the expense of segments VI, VII, and VIII of 136 x 80 mm in diameter. An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done urgently on the day of admission to our department and confirmed that it was a giant sub-capsular hematoma of the liver at a phase of resorption without any traumatic or hepatic tumour pathology that could explain this spontaneous bleeding. We performed ultrasound-guided drainage (G10 diameter nephrostomy drain) of the hematoma under local anaesthesia; the drain returned 800 ml of sequestered blood upon placement, and the bacteriological study of the collected fluid showed no bacterial contamination. On the first day after drainage, an abdominal CT-scan was performed to check the position of the drain and consider its mobilization; this time radiological signs in lung cuts were compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The thoracic CT-scan showed lesions compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (ground glass opacities with moderate pulmonary involvement estimated between 15 and 20% as shown in. After review of the old radiological examinations of the abdomen, the same images were found in the pulmonary bases but not reported. A nasopharyngeal sample was sent for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the result was positive for Gene N and Gene E and confirmed the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the Algerian national protocol, we prescribed Azithromycin 500mg on the first day then 250 mg for the next 4 days and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg 3/day for 10 days. The outcomes were simple with drying up on day 02; the patient became afebrile on day 03 with an improvement of its general condition after removal of the drain. She was discharged on day 07 with prescription of home confinement for 14 days.",human
"Abdominal test revealed a remarkable symmetrical distention, with bulging flanks, positive fluid thrill. Crying on every attempt of abdominal palpation, which revealed tenderness and pain on all the abdomen. The percussion of the abdomen was dull on all the quadrants, no peristalsis. The patient was tachypnoic with no particular findings on the thorax examination.  Abdominal ultrasound exam revealed diffuse and massive ascites of mixed liquid/solid content. Laboratory findings included a normal cell counts: white blood cells 1300 cells/mm 3 (normal value 5000-10000 cells/mm 3), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dl (normal value 12-15 g/dl), sodium 136 mEq/L (normal value 135-145 mEq/L), potassium 5.6 mEq/L (normal value 3.5-5.1 mEq/L), ESR 44 mm/h (normal value 3-13 mm/h). Obtained the consent from the parents, nasogastric and vescical catheters were positioned, and the patient was brought to the operatory room, candidate to emergency explorative laparotomy. Under general endotracheal anesthesia with halothane, the emergency laparotomy with midline incision, revealed 4 liters of purulent/alimentary free peritoneal fluid, massive retroperitoneal lymphomegaly, multiple caseous nodes diffuse on the peritoneum and the bowel, measuring about 0.5 to 4 mm of diameter, and some bigger nodules (up to 1.5 cm) covered by caseous mucus with the suspect aspect of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis. On the middle jejunum 3 major perforations on the antimesenteric side of the bowel were identified, surrounded by hyperemic and inflamated tissue with the typical aspect of typhoid bowel perforation. Some intestinal hyperemic intestinal typhoid lesions were also present, but not perforated yet. The surgical findings are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2. The surgical procedure included a lavage of the abdominal cavity and exploration of all the bowel for small lesion or perforations. A primary closure of the 3 perforations was performed with a separate stitch technique always used in the hospital [5]: a single-layer suture with 6 large vicryl 2/0 ""U"" stitches, through the seromuscular layer at 1cm from the perforation, to use the healthy tissue to close the perforation in a part of the bowel where there was less inflammatory involvement, with introflection of the perforation itself. A sample of the purulent material was taken for analysis, together with 2 peritoneal nodules.   Considering the severity of the abdominal contamination, a delayed primary closure was planned, 3 drains were placed and a laparostomy was done fixing a grease gauze to the open aponeurosis with a continuous non-absorbable suture covered with sterile sponges. The samples sent for laboratory analysis showed a high load of acid fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen staining and positive serology for Salmonella tiphy bacillus. The patient was very unstable throughout all the procedure, requiring correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and one blood transfusion. A combined therapy of ciprofloxacine and metronidazole was administered intravenously ad the end of the surgical procedure for the treatment of the typhoid fever clearly recognized by the experienced local surgeon. A specifical treatment for the miliary peritoneal tuberculosis was not started due to the not certain origin of the peritoneal lesions. The general condition of the patient got worse hour by hour with a progressive septic shock and multi-organ failure. The young girl died 18 hours after the surgical procedure.",human
"The diagnosis ofmitral valve IE was confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE); there was no annular abscess. The results of laboratory tests are shown as follows: the white blood cell count was 14,500 mm 3, hemoglobin concentration 9.3 g/l, creatinine 92 μmol/l and C-reactive protein 123 mg/dl. Computed topographics can of the head revealed no abnormalities. Initial blood cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic treatment with Oxacillin + gentamicin was started. His symptoms improved within 72 hours later. Four days after admission, he felt a sudden onset of substernal chest pain. His ECG showed ST segment elevation in leads V 3 V 4, and emergency echocardiography revealed the disappearance of vegetation on the mitral valve. The coronary angiography noted a complete occlusion of the distal tract of the LAD artery, while the remaining coronary arteries were completely free from any stenosis/atherosclerotic lesion. After aspiration of the thrombus, the distal LAD occlusion resolved with restoration of TIMI flow grade 3. His complaints and ECG changes improved after the procedure, and he was discharged after the completion of 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment. 2 nd case A 72-year-old man, with a history of rheumatic heart disease, presented with a 2-month history of fever and lethargy. His coronary risk factors were age and hypertension.  Laboratory tests revealed significant inflammatory syndrome (CRP=178 mg/l) and anemia (hemoglobin=10.1 g/dl). Renal function was correct. Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated fromperipheral blood cultures. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large circumferential periaortic abscess, and a doppler revealed moderate aortic regurgitation. TEE confirmed the same data \(Figure 3). The patientwas diagnosed withIE, and treated with intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin. Computed tomographic scan of the head showed no abnormalities, and abdominal computed tomography scan found a mycotic aneurysm of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery measuring 13 mm. Three days after admission, the patient complained of worsening chest pain. The electrocardiogram showed significant anterior ST depression, and troponin I level rose to 5.3 ng/ml. Emergency coronary angiography noted an area of narrowing of the left main and LAD arteries. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery for further management. Emergency surgery confirmed a large aortic root abscess compressing the left main and LAD arteries. The patient underwent an obliteration of the abscess cavity, aortic valve replacementwith a bioprosthesis, annulus reconstruction using pericardium, and a single aortocoronary bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery. There was considerable difficulty in weaning the patient of by-pass, and despite intra-aortic balloon pumping, high dose catecholamine support and antibiotics, the patient died after 48h.",human
"Furthermore the boy presented a progressive abdominal distension since birth, progressive pallor and recurrent episodes of fever since 1 year of age. There was history of blood transfusions for last 2 months. On the other side there was no history of jaundice, vomiting, urinary or bowel complaints, bleeding from any site or neurological complaints. On admission, he was very pale with silvery gray scalp hair, white eyelashes, he was hypotonic, tachycardic, fever of 40°C, lymphoadenopathy and hepato-splenomegaly. The blood count showed pancytopenia; 1980 white blood cells/µL (VN 4000-13 500/µL), neutrophils 820/µL, 910 cells/µL, hemoglobin (Hb) 6.3 g/dL (11.5-14 VN, 5 g/dL), platelets 44 000/µL (VN 150 000-400 000/µL), There were no giant cytoplasmic granules in leucocytes. The liver function tests were normal expect low albumin (2.1 mg/dL) and increased alkaline phosphatase (1196 mg/dL) with low fibrinogen (1.7g/l). Serum triglycerides, ferrintin and lactic dehydrogenase were very high; respectively 4.75g/L; 2763µg/L and 597U/L. the C reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 83mg/ l. A chest X-ray was normal while the abdominal ultrasound showed a hepatomegaly and a splenomegaly, free biliary ducts without ascites. Because of hepato-splenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia the diagnosis of Macrophage activation syndrome was evoked indicating a bone marrow aspiration that showed numerous morphologically benign macrophages with haemophagocytic activity that comforting the diagnosis of a SAM according to Ravelli and HLH-2004 criteria Table 1. Blood culture, urine examination, malarial serology, Kala Azar serology, viral serologies such as EBV, hepatitis A, B, C and human immunodeficiency virus HIV, serologies of rickettsia, syphilis and toxoplasmosa were negatives. Serologies of CMV and rubella showed an old immunization. The immunological tests such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-LKM1, anti-mitochondria and anti-smooth muscle antibodies were negatives. Because of the consanguineous family, notion of recurrent infection and the presence of silvery-gray color of the hair and eyebrows, diagnosis of Griscelli Syndrome was evoked directing a light microscopy examination of the hair that showed a large, irregular clumps of pigments characteristic of Griscelli Syndrome. The molecular biology showed mutation in RAB27A gene confirming the diagnosis of a Griscelli syndrome type 2. The first-line therapy in management of Macrophage activation syndrome complicating Griscelli syndrome type 2 was based on the parenteral administration of high doses of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone pulses 1g/0.73m 2 /day for 3 days then 60mg/m 2) with poor response; persisting with involvement of the 3 cell lines in the blood count, elevated ferritin and triglycerides. Given the lack of response to steroids, Etoposide was started for 3 days associated with cyclophosphamide, the evolution was good with improvement of count blood cells, ferritin was lessening while the bone marrow showed decreased numerous of macrophages with low haemophagocytic activity. On the other side the infectious process was good managed by perfusion of Antibiotics such as Ceftazidim in combination with aminoside. The patient was sent home with prednisone and cyclosporine, He was placed on the list of bone marrow transplantation (BMT).",human
"The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Abnormal laboratory results on admission included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.830 (4-10.5x10³/μL), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (28mg/dl, normal ≤0.5mg/dl), slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 56 IU/L (normal 5-40 IU/L), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) of 255 IU/L (normal <225 IU/L). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography on admission revealed a mildly enlarged liver and spleen and the presence of 2 sizable, hypoechoic lesions. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the 2 aforementioned lesions in diameter of 5.6cm at the left liver lobe and 5.2cm in the right lobe Figure 1, Figure 2. The lesions were hypodense and presented peripheral enhancement after intravenous contrast, similar to the morphology of hepatic abscesses. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Culture guided antimicrobials and appropriate drainage was our first option. Empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (400mg every 12 hours), and metronidazole (500mg every 8 hours) was initiated. All cultures resulted negative. Initially, we performed percutaneous sonographic (U/S) guided aspiration into the left hepatic abscess cavity. A thick, purulent material of 40cc was drained and sent for culture. Microbiology revealed a Gram-negative bacterium that presented slow growth. On the 5 th and 8 th days of admission, we performed CT guided catheter drainage of both abscesses. Meanwhile irregular spikes of fever with daytime variation accompanied by night sweats persisted. Ciprofloxacin discontinued and meropenem at a dose of 1gr every 8 hours administered. Thorough screening for other possible sources of infection, resulted negative. Transthoracic echocardiography was negative for vegetations and showed mild mitral regurgitation. Entamoeba histolytica Abs, echinococcus Abs, leismania Abs, brucella Abs were negative. Gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation was unrevealing. The patient was also HIV negative and no other immunodeficiency conditions were identified. Eventually, the isolate identified by the Vitek 2 automated system and classified as A. aphrophilus. To confirm the identification of the strain we performed matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The sensitivity test was performed with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips; the isolate's susceptibility was to ceftriaxone ≤0.125 (S), cefepime ≤0.5 (S), ciprofloxacin ≤0.125 (S), gentamycin ≤0.5 (S), amikacin ≤0.125 (S) and to meropenem ≤0.032 (S). Percutaneous drainage of both abscesses, combined with antimicrobial treatment, was successful and the patient's clinical condition improved. Thankfully, no surgical procedure was required. The drains were removed immediately the fluid from the abscess cavities became clear. Meropenem was administered for a total of 2 weeks. Then meropenem was switched to oral ciprofloxacin for another 4 weeks and the patient was discharged from the hospital, in full recovery. Follow-up sonogram obtained almost 2 months after the drainage showed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual liver cavities.",human
"On the arrival, the oxygen saturation was 99%, the heart rate was 164 beats per minute and the temperature was 36 degrees of Celsius. The child was first examined by a paediatrician who asked a paediatric surgery consultation due to the referred head injury. From the paediatric surgery clinical examination and estimation, the Glasgow Coma Scale was 14, there were no palpable or visible lesions on the head and the eye's pupils reacted to the light symmetrically. The abdominal auscultation revealed absence of bowel sounds, but no visible flatulence was present. From the abdominal palpation which was easily conducted, the abdomen was soft and there were not clinical signs of peritoneal irritation. The rectal digital examination had as a result an explosive evacuation of the bowel with diarrhea and was negative for blood. During the examination the child presented intermittent peripheral acrocyanosis and because of the quick deterioration of the clinical condition, we immediately catheterized a peripheral vein, took blood samples and tried to make a chest and abdominal x-ray. The mother accidentally breastfed the child while waiting for the x-ray to be done and spontaneously the child vomited and lost consciousness. The patient was transferred to the shock room without a diagnosis establishment because the plain x-ray was not performed. An anesthesiologist was called, the child was intubated and after the vital signs stabilization and a nasogastric tube insertion, because of the very disorienting medical history and the wide spectrum of the differential diagnosis which included both brain injury, undiagnosed heart disease and gut volvulus, which means that we could not focus our diagnosis on which pathology gave those signs and symptoms, the baby underwent an immediate full body computed tomography scan (CT scan). From the first axial images the diagnosis was established. The right chest cavity was almost completely occupied by loops of the gastrointestinal tract, which presented local thickening of their wall and fluid elements that misaligned the right lung resulting in passive atelectasis of the biggest part of the right lower lobe. Simultaneously, the CT scan revealed intrathoracic projection of the mesenteric vessels and a large displacement of the vascular structures of the mediastinum. The liver was intact, there were not any other lesions of the abdominal viscera and the brain CT scan was normal. The diaphragmatic hernia diagnosis was established and the patient was immediately transferred to the operation theater and underwent an exploratory laparotomy after obtaining the parent's informed consent. With a transverse incision in the right upper quadrant, we accessed the abdominal cavity and found a defect in the right diaphragm. The loops of the whole small bowel and the loops of the colon till the median of the transverse colon were gently retracted from the right hemithorax back to the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect. The bowel did not present signs of strangulation, the liver dome was misaligned to the medium line and the right coronary ligament of the liver was found hypoplastic. After the retraction of the abdominal viscera in their normal cavity, we aspirated approximately 150ml of serous pleural fluid from the right thoracic cavity and then inserted a chest tube through the sixth intercostal space. We then closed the defect of the diaphragm according to the Mayo technique and reassessed the retracted bowel which seemed to be normal. It must be underlined that a hernia sac was not found during the operation. We finally closed the abdominal trauma in layers and the child was transferred intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a stable clinical condition. The infant remained at the PICU for five days. The bowel sounds were present 2 days postoperatively and she had a bowel evacuation at the third postoperative day. The patient was extubated at the same day and returned to our Paediatric Surgery Clinic in good condition at the fifth postoperative day. During the hospitalization in our department the infant remained in good condition. The nasogastric tube was removed the day that she returned from the PICU, the breastfeeding started and was well tolerated apart from two episodes of vomiting the next two days. The chest tube was removed at the sixth day postoperatively and the intravenous antibiotic administration with a second generation cephalosporin was stopped. The next day and because of the association of diaphragmatic hernias with other congenital anomalies, a consultation from a paediatric cardiologist was asked because the other systems were checked through the preoperative CT scan. The heart ultrasound revealed that the anterior descending and the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery appear to protrude from separate orifices in the left atrium of the Valsalva, which is a finding of no particular clinical significance. The child was discharged at the seventh postoperative day in an excellent general condition and was then followed up at outpatient clinic 15 days, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. She had a full recovery from the operation, with no wound infections and without difficulty to thrive. At the time that this case is reported, the child is healthy and has not presented any medical problem associated with her past surgical history.",human
"She had no history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma. The patient went to a nearby health facility where she was hospitalized. She was conservatively managed with antibiotics and transfused 450cc of whole blood. Progress was marked by intermittent bleeding and an increase in the size of the swelling. An increase in the intensity of the pain prompted a referral to our health facility.  She was G2P1011. She terminated a pregnancy at 8 weeks, 3 years earlier. A live vaginal birth 15months earlier with neither vaginal nor perineal tears. Menarche was at 14 years; she bleeds for 5 days and has a regular cycle of 30 days.   On examination, the patient was alert. Her blood pressure was 126/78 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and her temperature was 36.5ºC. She had mild pallor. On palpation of her abdomen, no tenderness, guarding, or rebound was elicited. At the perineum, there was a large swelling on the right labia majora, measuring 7x6 cm, necrotic, tender and tense, a vaginal examination was not possible. A pelvic (transabdominal) ultrasound was done which showed pelvic organs in place and a hematoma thus eliminating a uterine prolapse. A full blood count was done which revealed a normocytic normochromic anaemia at 9g/dl. Platelets were normal.  Vaginal examination/exploration and debridement were done under local anaesthesia and a packed dressing was done. No further bleeding was noted after this. She was given the following medications, antibiotics; ceftriaxone 1g every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 08 hours and gentamycin 80mg every 12 hours, analgesics: paracetamol 1000mg, 08 hourly. She was also supplemented with iron tablets, 80mg/day. Sitz baths were started and done 12 hourly and polyvidone iodine. She was discharged on day three post admission and continued with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths. Subsequent follow up was unremarkable. Case 2 : a 17-year-old female presented to our emergency room on the 01/12/2018 with pain and swelling on the left labia majora. It started 3 hours before arrival. She noticed a rapidly increasing swelling which was extremely tender and tense on the left side of the vulva. She was unable to stand or sit and the pain was not relieved by painkillers, paracetamol and diclofenac. There was no history of coitus in the last 3 days and she had shaved the previous day. She had no history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma.  She is G1P1 and mother to 7-month-old infant.  On arrival, she was in pains. Her blood pressure was 130/87 mmHg, a pulse of 78 beats per minute and temperature was 37.2ºC. Conjunctivae were pink and sclera anicteric.  There was a large swelling on left labia majora 9x7 cm, tense, tender with no skin discoloration. The swelling ruptured spontaneously and we drained about 500cc of clotted blood. The wound was packed and there was no further bleeding until 12 hours later when the dressing was removed. She received prophylactic antibiotics; ceftriaxone 2g before debridement and had fluids, normal saline and ringers lactate, 500cc 12 hourly for 24 hours. The patient was discharged two days later with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths.",human
"The patient reported that the lesion was painless without tendency to heal, but could not precisely recall when it had first appeared (2 or 3 years). The rest of the physical examination was essentially normal. Otherwise, the patient presented neither risk factors of HIV infection nor chronic disease, transfusion or immunosuppressive therapy.  Laboratory findings on admission demonstrated in the blood count a pancytopenia with normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL), leucocytopenia (2900/mm 3) and thrombocytopenia (113000/mm 3). Sedimentation rate was 115 mm (1 st hour), C-reactive protein 215mg/l and procalcitonine < 0.5 ng/ml. Serum Protein Electrophoresis displayed an abnormal pattern with a hypoalbuminemia at 31.1 g/l and a monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia at 38.4 g/l. Her renal, liver and hemostasis function tests were normal. Chest imaging and cardiac ultrasounds were within normal limits. However, abdomino-pelvic imaging (ultrasound and scan) revealed the presence of a homogenous hepatosplenomegaly. Initially differential diagnosis mainly included brucellosis, typhoid fever, visceral leishmaniasis and hematological malignancies. Bacteriological cultures of blood (3 series), stool and urine revealed all negative. Hepatitis B Virus, Salmonella and Brucella antibody tests were also unrevealing. However, Leishmania rk39 immuno-chromatography test was positive, consistent with a VL diagnosis. A bone marrow aspiration was performed. Its parasitological examination revealed the presence of Leishmania amastigote forms. The patient serum was also positive for Leishmania anti-bodies by immunofluorescence antibody test (titer = 1/400). Blood parasite load determined by a real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the Leishmania kinetoplast was 400 parasites/ml [5].  On another hand, direct microscopic examination performed on skin smears showed no Leishmania amastigotes. However, Leishmania DNA amplification was obtained from the dermal DNA extract, using the same qPCR. Molecular typing of isolates obtained from both samples (blood and skin) was carried out by sequence analysis of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of rRNA gene. This analysis showed that the Leishmania strains from the arm cutaneous lesion and the blood corresponded to the species L. infantum and were 100% identical.  Visceral Leishmaniasis diagnosis was retained and a course of anti-leishmanial therapy with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate at a dose of 1 g/kg/day every 2 days was started. The patient developed a mild renal failure, which was corrected after spacing the cures and rehydration. The response to treatment was rapidly favorable with apyrexia and an improvement in general conditions including resolution of fatigue and increased appetite. The splenomegaly resolved and blood count levels returned to reference ranges. Real-time PCR in blood after 28 days of treatment revealed negative. However, the skin lesion did not improve although Leishmania qPCR on dermal sample became negative. The physician reconsidered CL diagnosis and recommended a skin biopsy which was refused by the patient. A year later, the lesion was clinically almost the same. A polarized dermoscopy examination revealed ulcerations and short, fine arborizing vessels, evocative of a basal cell carcinoma. Histopathology examination of the skin lesion biopsy, finally accepted by the patient, confirmed the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. A complete excision of the tumor was performed and the evolution was good.",human
"The patient was apyretic. Arterial gas testing showed normal corrected anion gap metabolic acidosis, with hypokalaemia at 3 mmol/L and normal lactatemia at 0.43 mmol/L. Diagnosis of diabetes decompensation was made despite absence of ketone bodies on urine dipstick test. After conditioning, the patient was put on a hydration regimen with hypokalaemia correction and insulin therapy, and then referred to intensive care for additional management in face of non-improvement in his neurological condition. A brain scan was performed objectifying multiple parietal ischemic foci, chest scanner showed a thickening of the septal and foci of bronchial dilation without sign of pneumopathy linked to COVID-19 infection; abdominal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities. An electrocardiogram was performed showing no electrical signs of hypokalaemia or repolarization disturbances, transthoracic echocardiography was normal, as was ultrasound of supraortic trunks. Laboratory workup showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 45.5 with negative procalcitonin (0.04 ng/ml), white blood cells at 12,500 (PNN at 9280 and normal lymphocytes at 2140), no thrombocytopenia, normal ferritinemia, fibrinogen levels elevated to 5.37 and negative D-dimers. Natremia, magnesemia, corrected serum calcium, phosphoremia and thyroid assessment was normal. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by nasopharyngeal swab was negative, COVID-19 serology (IgM and IgG) was also negative. Faced with concept of ischemic lesions on a brain scan, anticoagulation at a prophylactic dose, antiplatelet aggregation with aspirin and statins were initiated as well as an antibiotic therapy at a meningeal dose with ceftriaxone pending results of the lumbar puncture which subsequently showed a clear liquid with a high proteinorachia at 0.58g/l (normal between 0.15 and 0.45), a normal glycorachia/blood sugar ratio at 0.58 (normal at 0.5); with a culture showing less than 3 elements, sterile after 24 hours. Cerebral Magnetic resonance angiography performed on day 2 of admission showed signs in favor of vascular leukopathy, with some calcifications in basal ganglia and cortical atrophy. Electroencephalogram showed signs of epilepsy, which prompted us to retain the diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycemia-related epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsant treatment was started with sodium valproate. The Patient worsened neurologically despite correction of his metabolic acidosis, he was intubated on day 3 of his admission (day 5 of symptoms onset). A cerebral computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed without showing any progressive lesions. Faced with installation of lymphopenia (HIV serologies 1 and 2 negative) with increased CRP, a multiplex RT-PCR in protected distal bronchial sample as well as in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were performed, the first was positive to SARS-CoV-2. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was positive but with a cycle threshold (CT) of 38.6. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalopathy was retained. The patient is still in intensive care.",human
"The blood count showed hemoglobin at 9g/dl, MCV at 85 µ 3, lymphopenia at 400/mm 3, while platelets were normal 450 000/mm 3. Direct coombs test was negative. Serum Albumin was 25g/l; proteins level was low at 50g/l and proteinuria at 3.2g/day. Creatinine was normal. Anti-nuclear antibody ANA were positive 1/320 with homogeneous pattern, anti-dsDNA level was 160U/ml. Anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were positive 25UGPL. Rheumatoid Factor was negative. C3 and C4 complement fractions were low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l). Chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed proximal pulmonary embolism. Renal ultrasound was normal. Renal biopsy reveals immunocomplex nephritis, lupus nephritis, segmental mesangial proliferation, mild activity lupus nephritis class III (A/C). Before starting corticosteroids, we analyzed electrolytes. Serum calcium was elevated 132 mg/l with hyper-calciuria 479 mg/24 h. 25 OHD was normal. Alcaline phosphatase was 420 UI/l. the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. Serum protein Electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serum and urine immunofixation as well as Bence-Jones proteinuria were negative. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was high 628 pg/ml. CT scan and ultrasound of parathyroid imaging revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm. Femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) showed osteoporosis (T-score: -2.6). In addition, we found multiple pelvic osteolytic lesions at CT scan. Other causes of hypercalcemia and bone lysis were excluded. The diagnosis in this case was SLE with lupus nephritis class III and anti-phospholipid syndrome, complicated by pulmonary embolism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism causing severe hypercalcemia, osteoporosis. Therapeutic intervention: the patient was given a pulse of methyl-prednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, associated with intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 /month for 6 months. Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day was prescribed as a maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg/day. Treatment of pulmonary embolism was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 0.1 ml/10 kg/12h) followed by antivitamin K. For Hypercalcemia, patient has received intravenous fluid with furosemide. She also required Alendronate 70 mg/week with Vitamin D 400u/day for osteoporosis. The left parathyroid gland was surgically removed. Histopathological examination revealed parathyroid adenoma. Her immediate postoperative parathyroid hormone level was 64 pg/ml with a calcium level of 98 mg/l. Follow-up and outcomes: forty-eight hours after the surgery she developed oral paresthesia. She had hypocalcemia at 72 mg/l. She required oral supplementation for few months. Additional investigations for multiple endocrine neoplasia were negative. The patient remained asymptomatic. Her SLE was calm without any relapse. Control of proteinuria was negative. Corticosteroids was dropped. The follow-up was 4 years.",human
"His symptoms were aggravated. The ankle was noted to be slightly edematous, but warm to the touch, and diffusely tender to palpation. His temperature was 39°C. Diagnostic assessment: the hemoglobin was 9.5 g/dl, the white blood cell count was 18800/mm 3, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) was 75 mm/h. Serum laboratory studies, including CBC count and inflammatory markers, were all elevated. An X-ray of the ankle showed a posterior-medial lytic lesion of the talus and soft tissue swelling around the ankle joint. However, the computed tomography (CT) scan findings revealed a talus fracture. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not done as it was not available. Given the clinical findings a talar osteomyelitis with septic arthritis of the ankle was suspected despite the result of the CT scan. The bone scintigraphy demonstrated a septic arthritis and the presence of bone marrow edema in the talus without being able to reach a precise diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Therapeutic intervention: the patient was urgently taken to the operating room. During the operation, the ankle joint was explored through an anterior approach. There were some false membranes, a thin turbid fluid and a pertuit at the junction bone cartilage of the talus. The talar cartilage was regular and normal-looking. The pertuit, allowing access to a cavity, was cleaned and the yellow organized fibrinous pus was drained. The biopsy specimens for the histopathological examination and culture were taken at that site. Curettage and irrigation were performed, and the joint was closed over suction drains. An empirical antibiotic treatment IV (cephalosporin + gentamycine) was initiated. Follow-up and outcomes: febrile peaks persisted during the first three days. The blood culture and the specimen of the joint isolated Staphylococcus aureus Meti-R. The anatomopathological analysis of the ankle specimen showed histological features of an abscess and hyperplastic synovial cells. So, the IV antibiotic treatment was substituted by teicoplanin with a better clinical and biological progression. Drainage was maintained for twelve days (until normalization of CRP) and intravenous antibiotics for 3 weeks. In the third week, the peripheral leukocytes count was 8600/mL, and the CRP decreased to 2.43mg. The patient's antibiotic was then substituted by oral pristinamycin for three weeks. In the fourth week, the ESR and CRP were 7 mm/hr and 3 mg/L, respectively. At that time, the patient did not complain of any pain or limitation of the range of motion of the ankle. The cast was removed six weeks after surgery. At six months, radiographies showed that the lesion healed completely. The parents were very satisfied. Their child acquired walking at the age of 14 months. In the last follow-up visit at 18 months postoperatively, the patient had no pain or limitation in walking and running.",human
"There has been no known exposure to COVID- 19 and has no known vice or allergy.  In addition, the clinical examination found a temperature (T°) of 38.6°C; tachycardia at 117 beats/minute, oxygen saturation of 86%; blood pressure of 90/50mm Hg. The neurological examination was not further investigated due to the clinical condition of the patient. He was transferred to the intensive care unit, put on oxygen and antipyretic medication and vascular filling with crystalloids (30ml/kg), while waiting for the result of the metabolic workup, which proved normal. The biological investigation revealed some disorders including: a non-specific inflammatory syndrome with a sedimentation rate (SV) at 62mm/h; a C-reactive protein (CRP) at 36mg/l and white blood cells > 12000/ mm³. While in hospital, the patient presented with repeated paroxysmal seizures within a short period of time, without a return to normal consciousness between seizures. The diagnosis of status with septic shock was made and the patient strictly followed the protocol for the management of status epilepticus (Clonazepam 1ml + Phenobarbital 60mg/kg by slow infusion + Thiopental 5mg/kg as a bolus). He did a brain CT scan which did not reveal any specifics. The intercritical EEG tracing performed revealed a 4-5Hz theta activity, ample, symmetrical, bilateral, and associated with epileptogenic graphoelements of diffuse point type accentuated in the right hemisphere, suggesting multifocal epilepsy.  The COVID-19 PCR confirmatory test that was performed at admission was later (24h) positive and the D-dimer level was 2340μg/ L. The patient was transferred to the national COVID-19 case management center and subjected to chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day. This molecule was later discontinued on the neurologist's recommendation due to the paroxysmal recurrence of seizures. Several other tracings were requested but were not performed due to the non-availability of EEG in the said structure. He later received corticosteroid therapy and the rest of the management was symptomatic. After 1 month without seizures, following 2 RT-PCR tests, the patient was discharged with a prescription issued by the Neurologist. Case N°2: patient aged 11 years, followed at the National Center for the Management of Persons Infected with COVID-19 for influenza-like illness, respiratory distress and confirmed positive under treatment with chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day, Azythromycin 250mg/day. After 1 week of treatment, loss of consciousness with generalized tonic-clonic seizure, lateral biting of the tongue, hyper salivation and loss of urine occurs. There is no personal or family history of epileptic seizures. According to the mother, the delivery took place in better condition. The clinical examination found respiratory difficulty, tachycardia at 123 beats/minute but apyretic. The neurological examination in the inter critical phase found persistent mental confusion for more than 1 hour. The metabolic balance sheet is within the limits of normal, the other biological parameters reveal a non-specific inflammatory syndrome. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a heart rhythm disorder. Brain CT scan and intercranial EEG were not performed urgently. We recommended discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate and initiation of clonazepam 1ml intravenous (IV) benzodiazepam as needed. Background antiepileptic [levitracetam (keppra 500g/day)] was instituted following the second seizure. After recovery from the COVID-19 infection, and the absence of seizure for 3 weeks following the new treatment recommendations, we performed a brain scan and EEG, which were found to be normal. The patient was discharged and recommended for neurological surveillance. Case N°3: patient aged 16 years, followed at the national center for the management of COVID-19 positive cases. Patient was asymptomatic on admission. No known drug defects or allergies. Following a voluntary RT-PCR test that the patient performed, he was diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and started treatment with chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day, azythromycin 250 mg/day. After 4 days of treatment, a loss of consciousness with Bravais Jacksonian clonic seizures of the right hemicorps occurred. No personal or family history of epileptic seizures is found.  The clinical examination does not reveal any particularities. There was no postcritical confusion and the rest of the neurological examination was normal. The diagnosis of focal epilepsy with roladic paroxysm was made. The metabolic assessment was within normal limits, the other biological parameters revealed a non-specific inflammatory syndrome. We recommended discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate and initiation of clonazepam 1ml IV benzodiazepine as needed. Levitracetam 500g/day was instituted following a repeat attack within 48 hours after discontinuation of chloroquine. The patient was discharged with 16 days of seizure-free follow-up and 2 negative RT-PCR tests. Brain CT scan and EEG performed after recovery showed no detectable abnormalities.",human
"Subsequently, the baby was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Urgent echocardiography demonstrated mild-moderate pulmonary hypertension with no structural heart defects. Initial blood workup including a complete blood count at birth revealed hemoglobin: 4.4 g/dL, hematocrit: 14.30%, platelet: 78,000 K/µL, direct Coomb's test was markedly positive, elevated reticulocytes and O Rh-positive blood. The mother blood group and Rh is O negative with the previous baby of O positive. Thus, Rh incompatibility diagnosis was made and treatment was started. She had one healthy Rh-positive child from her first pregnancy. Of note, in the present pregnancy, an anti-D antibody was not tested and the fetus did not receive an intrauterine blood transfusion. The mother received Rho \(D) immunoglobulin in the first 72-hr post her prior delivery and reportedly received another dose at 32 weeks of gestation of this pregnancy. Our patient received a blood transfusion and then an exchange transfusion. Furthermore, he had been stabilized with fluids and antibiotics. At day 3 of life, he was extubated, however, he continued to have decreased hemoglobin with increased liver transaminases with a peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 238 U/L (normal ranges, 0 to 38U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 169 U/L (normal ranges, 0 to 41 U/L). Also, total and direct bilirubin continue to increase and reached a peak of 472 umol/L (normal ranges, 0 to 17) and 343 umol/L (normal ranges, 0 to 3), respectively. Ursodeoxycholic acid was given as a treatment for cholestatic jaundice for a short period. Platelet count was low; 56,000 to 138,000 in the first week then normalized and continued to be normal without platelet transfusions. Reticulocyte count was initially elevated then noticed to be inappropriately low (0.29%) to the hemoglobin level upon discharge. Additionally, serum ferritin found to be elevated 6013 ng/L was attributed to repeated blood transfusions. The patient was discharged home at 20 days of life, with hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, after receiving a total of three blood transfusions with a plan of weekly follow-up. At 30 days of age, he was hospitalized for anemia with a hemoglobin of 4.8 g/dL and reticulocyte count of 0.34%. Total and conjugated serum bilirubin and ferritin levels were elevated, however; they were lower than prior levels. On physical examination, he was icteric and tachycardic with no hepatosplenomegaly. Therefore, he received packed red cell transfusion. With persistent low hemoglobin and reticulocyte count, bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed normal cellularity. Hyporegenerative anemia diagnosis was made secondary to Rh incompatibility for which treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (250 U/kg by subcutaneous injection, three times a week) was initiated on day 32 of life. Ten days later another transfusion was necessary (Hb was 6.5 g/dL and reticulocyte 0.3%). In 3 weeks of EPO treatment, reticulocyte count increased to 1.2% and hemoglobin level stabilized. Erythropoietin was discontinued at four weeks of treatment. Other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia were excluded. Work-up was negative for TANDEM mass spectrometry, urine-blood amino acid, α1-antitrypsin, serological test results for TORCH, hepatitis A, B and C, parvovirus, and reducing substances. Additionally, endocrine work-up, coagulation profile and abdominal ultrasound were normal. On follow up, bilirubin and ferritin levels decreased and normalized at four months of age while liver markers normalized at one year. No chelation therapy was needed to normalize the ferritin level. The patient had been followed at 4, 6 and 12 months of age at which he was meeting normal developmental milestones for age.",human
"History revealed that her nails had improved with age but were small and discolored at birth. The patient's family history revealed that her younger sister has a similar problem. On intra oral examination generalized missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth with severe attrition was noticed. Generalized pit and fissure caries was noticed on all the posterior teeth one deep caries was noticed with left maxillary anterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori noticed with poor gingival and periodontal condition, oral mucosa was normal. Investigation: panoramic radiograph confirmed the clinical data, showed periapical infection with right maxillary anterior teeth, generalised absence of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arch was shocking. Case 2: a 14-year-old school going girl, sibling of the case 1, was examined after clinical examination of her elder sister, she was moderately built and nourished for her age, she revealed no significant systemic illness with no deleterious and par-functional habits. On general physical examination the patient was well oriented and conscious, she had similar spoon-shaped slow-growing small fragile fingernails with onychorrhexis with deformed toenails like her elder sister which was better compared to before. On intra oral examination generalized missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth was noticed. Generalized pit and fissure caries on posterior teeth with one deep caries with right mandibular posterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori was also common with poor periodontal condition having generalized stains and calculus, oral mucosa was normal. Investigation: panoramic radiograph showed generalized missing of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arch. Based on family history, clinical, and radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of partial anodontia was given considering mesoectodermal dysplasia, ectodermal dysplasia and tooth and nail syndrome (nail dysplasia with hypodontia) in differential diagnosis. Genetic investigation DNA extraction: 5 ml of blood sample was collected from the median cubital vein of the patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using the standard Qiagen blood DNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sanger sequencing: in order to validate the identified MSX1 mutation, primers were designed using the Primer3 tool for MSX1 exon 1; forward primer (5' -CTGGCCTCGCCTTAT TAG C 3') and reverse primer (5'-GCCTGGGTTCTGGCTCTC 3'). A standard PCR was performed and the products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing through ABI 3500xl genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA USA). Result: the present work is intended to identify the involvement of MSX1 gene variants in familial hypodontia. MSX1 is a vital gene in tooth development. The DNA sequences were analyzed and compared with DNA reference using DNASTAR alignment software (Madison, WI 53705 USA); meanwhile chromatograms were also viewed and analyzed using Sequence Scanner software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA USA). We have observed one point mutation on exon 1 of MSX1 (1A;c.731G > A). We observed that MSX1 is contributing to cause hypodontia. In the present study, MSX1 gene is mutated in familial hypodontia; however, the mutation of MSX1 alone might not cause phenotype change to the patient. Few other genes and mutation is the more predominant factor which might be contributing to hypodontia compared to MSX1. This can be identified by analysing whole exome or whole genome sequencing of the patient samples.",human
"The internet search suggested that he may have MFS, and this was the primary reason for him to visit the hospital to find out if he indeed did have MFS. The patient did not have a family history of a similar problem.  On general examination the patient was comfortable at rest, extremely tall (2.1 meters) and thin with typical musculoskeletal features of MFS. These included arachnodactyly with positive wrist and thumb signs, pectus carinatum deformity, hind foot valgus, dolichostenomelia (< 0.78), increased arm span/height, scoliosis, dolichochepaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, and retrognathia. His total systemic score was 10 based on the revised Ghent nosology. Figure 1 demonstrates the patients typical clinical signs of MFS.  The patient was normotensive with a sinus bradycardia of 60 beats per minute. The first heart sound was soft with a murmur of mitral regurgitation graded as 4/5.  There were no clinical features of infective endocarditis or cardiac failure. Respiratory examination demonstrated pectus carinatum and was otherwise normal.  Ophthalmology examination conducted by an ophthalmologist revealed a left dense cataract with lens subluxation but no dislocation, iridodonesis, an old retinal detachment and minimal light perception. The right eye had a clear lens with no subluxation or dislocation, but showed iridodonesis with myopia.  Laboratory tests were within normal limits (full blood count, urea and electrolytes, calcium, magnesium and phosphate, liver function tests, growth hormone, prolactin, troponin T, creatine kinase).  Chest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of greater the 50%. Echocardiography demonstrated prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with moderately severe mitral regurgitation and aortic root dilatation measuring 5 cm. The ejection fraction was 65% and no evidence of aortic dissection was noted.  Computerised tomography (CT) showed dilatation of the aortic sinuses of valsava extending to the ascending aorta. The aortic root was dilated measuring 6.3 X 6.4cm. The ascending aorta measured 3.1cm. There was no dissection or calcification of the aortic wall. The arch of the aorta and its main branches were within normal limits. The root of the main pulmonary artery was dilated measuring 4.1cm. The rest of the pulmonary arterial system was within normal limits. A suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted with length 15.1 cm and diameter of 5 cm. There were no features of dissection, mural thrombi, or signs of imminent rupture.  The right kidney had dual blood supply, with one artery arising from the inferior portion of the aneurysm and the other from the normal aorta inferiorly. The single left renal artery arose from the inferior aspect of the aneurysm. All renal arteries were patent and there was appropriate and symmetrical enhancement of the kidneys.   The coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric arteries arose from the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The inferior mesenteric artery arose from the normal abdominal aorta.  The lung fields were clear and the cranio-cervical junction was normal with no subluxation.  There was pectus carinatum and a left scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine. Dural ectasia with posterior scalloping of the vertebral bodies was noted in the lumbar sacral spine. There was expansion of the sacral spinal canal and enlargement of the sacral foramen.  The patient was counseled on his medical condition and offered surgery for his mitral valve and aortic root dilation. After consultation with his family he declined surgical intervention. He was discharged on losartan and subsequently lost to follow. Prior to discharge informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case.",human
"Though there was a history of a fresh still birth during the mother's first confinement, no congenital malformations were seen in that baby and there was no history of congenital anomalies in the extended family. Mother is a 30-year-old teacher and father a 35-year-old police officer and both had a secondary level of education. Physical examination revealed an irregularly shaped well-demarcated large defect on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region measuring 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. A yellow layer of membrane covered the defect. The patient had low set ears, he was irritable, with a tense anterior fontanelle and in respiratory distress. Other system examination were unremarkable. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. Baby had routine care as per protocol including: oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics at meningitis doses, dressing with sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. The respiratory distress subsided; oral feeds were eventually commenced and well tolerated. Multidisciplinary team management was done along with neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons. A babygram and an abdominopelvic scan done were normal. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to the posterior fontanelle giving an area of defect measuring 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm (AP X TR). The subcutaneous scalp tissues were not visualized. However, the brain in this region was overlaid by the dural meninges. The occipital, frontal and temporal bones of the cranial vault and their overlying scalp tissues were spared. The cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and the brain stem structures were normal in morphology and signal intensity. No intra-axial or extra-axial mass or collection seen. No area of abnormal enhancement seen. The cortical sulci, sylvian fissures, basal cisterns and ventricles are normal in calibre, outline and intensity. The orbits and retro-orbital structures are within normal limit. Conclusion: features in keeping with aplasia cutis congenita. Burns and plastic unit and neurosurgeons made plans for future intervention in form of raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. Baby was discharged home after 18 days of admission on oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing, for follow up at the specialty clinics. Case 2: baby YA, Hausa by tribe was referred at 48 hours of life on account of absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. Baby was delivered per vaginum at home, delivery was not associated with overt trauma to the head. Patient was a product of term gestation; birth weight was unknown though admission weight was 2 kg. Mother was 25-year-old and not gainfully employed, while father was a hospital attendant. Baby was the 3 rd child of parents in a monogamous, non-consanguineous setting; the two older siblings were alive and well. No known family history of congenital anomaly. There was no history of use of herbal medications and mother was not on any other medication. There was no history of exposure to radiation in pregnancy and parents did not live close to a network mask. Mother had no obstetric scan done in pregnancy. Important clinical findings at presentation were a very ill patient, febrile, cyanosed, hypertonic with a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from the frontal to the occipital area extending to the right parietal region. There was leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a likely dural involvement. He had desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, visible dilated abdominal wall veins as well as a grade 3 systolic cardiac murmur loudest at the left lower sternal edge. Other systems were essentially normal. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies (congenital cutis aplasia and congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect) with meningitis was made. Differentials of Adams-Oliver syndrome and Patau's syndrome were considered. Sepsis screen yielded Providencia specie and E. coli from blood and CSF respectively. Abdominal ultrasound scan was normal, unfortunately, brain MRI, echocardiography and chromosomal studies could not be done due to financial constraints. He was treated with parenteral antibiotics and wound was cleaned daily and dressed with betadine. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. The burns and plastic unit planned for prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover subsequently. Patient was discharged to parents on request after 35 days on admission, however baby died 7 days post discharge.",human
"Quickly considered as uncomplicated malaria. After self-medication with antimalarial, antibiotic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, the symptoms disappear in 3 days without ever being admitted to a ETC or healthcare facilities. October 28, 2014: MD, 18 years old, second wife of LC had a headache associated with fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. After 2 days' self-medication with unknown drugs, she was admitted in a military healthcare facility in Conakry. She was treated for both severe malaria and typhoid fever. Its symptoms disappear after 4 days without tested for ebola virus infection. The case that elucidated the history of ebola virus circulation in this family: MC, 7-month-old (son of LC and MD) has at October 28, 2014, fever associated with diarrhea. He was admitted in the paediatrics service in a Conakry University Hospital. In the first time, he was treated for malaria and acute gastroenteritis. After one week and the occurrence of hematemesis (4 November 2014), he was transferred in Donka ETC and tested positive for ebola virus by RT-PCR but died the same day.   The looking for the source of infection has led to perform serology and RT-PCR in parents. They have been positive in ELISA serology and negative in RT-PCR. LC and MD were positive for ebola IgM and IgG antibodies. Despite these medical evidences, the parents remained reluctant and accused the devil. However, a total of 21 individuals were followed by contact tracing teams and none developed symptoms of the ebola virus disease and all were tested negative 2 times in RT-PCR for ebola virus. History 2: family of Sir AT burial ceremonies On November 7, 2014: AT, 72 years old have attended the funeral of his son MT; 49 years old (considered as a probable case of infection with the ebola virus). On November 19, 2014: AT developed a fever associated with headache, abdominal pain and joint pain. He has been seen by a physician at the emergency service in an university hospital in Conakry. Known diabetic, her blood sugar was 6.83 mmol/l with a temperature at 39.7°C. He receives antimalarial treatment and an antibiotic. The symptoms disappear after 5 days without ever tested for ebola and without having been admitted to an ETC. The case that elucidated the history of the circulation of the virus in this family On November 30, 2014: the AT's daughter, FT developed a fever over 40°C, diarrhea, vomiting and physical asthenia. She was admitted at the Donka ETC, tested positive for the ebola Zaire virus by RT-PCR. Unfortunately, she died 11 days later. In total, 72 individuals have been registered as contacts around them. They were followed, released after 2 negative PCR and none developed any symptoms related to ebola disease. History 3: fear and promiscuity: AB, 25 years old and his friend ZM 33 years old, are living in the same bedroom. On March 26, 2015: AB: developed a fever associated with headache, dyspnea, joint pain and physical asthenia. After five days, he has been seen by a physician in cardiology department in an university hospital in Conakry. He received as an outpatient antimalarial treatment, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory. Given the persistence of signs, he has been seen by a traditional healer without success. Frightened by the epidemic context, he decided to hide to the contact tracing team. He has been finally located on April 17, 2015; he was asymptomatic. In Donka ETC, he has been tested positive for ebola Zaire by RT-PCR took care there and released after 2 negative consecutive RT-PCR.  His friend ZM presented April 3, 2015 a fever, headache and joint pain. He has been admitted to Donka ETC with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Tested positive for ebola virus by RT-PCR. After treatment, he recovered. A total of 36 contacts have been registered monitored and released after 2 negatives PCR and none of them developed any symptoms related to ebola disease.",human
"There was a slight leukocytosis with neutrophilia and normal platelet counts. Urea, creatinine and electrolytes were within normal limits. After resuscitation, he was taken to theatre for a laparotomy, where the peritoneal cavity was found to be completely soiled with fecal matter that was leaking from two anastomotic sites from his previous surgeries. The leaking segments of gut were resected, an abdominal washout was done, and an ileostomy was fashioned. However, due to extensive bowel edema, it was not possible to achieve fascial closure and a Bogotá bag, fashioned out of a recommissioned catheter drainage bag or intravenous fluid bag, was used for TAC. The absence of space in the ICU meant his care was to be continued in the general surgical ward. During his post-operative course, the patient underwent five re-look laparotomies with abdominal washouts for abdominal abscesses, and one instance for a colonic perforation at the hepatic flexure requiring a right colectomy. Each time, fascial closure was not feasible and a Bogotá bag was used for TAC. A central venous catheter was placed for fluid and antibiotic therapy. A Foley catheter was used to monitor urine output, and a stoma bag was used for routine stoma care. Enteral feeds were started early and maintained throughout his hospital stay, although he became cachectic, at one point weighing only 37 kilograms. His abdominal wound was dressed daily and allowed to granulate. Despite the challenge of caring for the OA in the setting of an adjacent ileostomy, the patient did not develop an entero-atmospheric fistula. He spent a total of 121 days in hospital and was discharged after adequate weight gain, and contracture of his abdominal wound. Case 2 : a 21-year-old man with a prior history of dyspepsia presented to MTRH with a 3-day history of acute onset upper abdominal pain, accompanied by vomiting and abdominal distension. The remainder of his history was unremarkable. On examination, he was tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. His abdomen was distended, tender with guarding, and silent on auscultation. Although his blood counts were unremarkable, he had azotemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. An abdominal x-ray showed air under the right hemidiaphragm. After fluid resuscitation and correction of his electrolyte abnormalities, he was taken to theatre with a diagnosis of perforated viscus. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, more than 2 liters of succus entericus was found emanating from a gastric wall perforation. A biopsy was taken, and an omental (Graham) patch was used to repair the defect. However, fascial closure could not be achieved owing to extensive bowel edema, and a Bogotá bag was used for TAC. The patient remained stable and a second-look laparotomy was performed 48 hours later. The gastric repair was still intact, bowel edema had subsided, and fascial closure was successful. He was discharged on a proton pump inhibitor one week later after spending a total of 10 days in the hospital. Histology was benign and the patient remained symptom free at the follow-up clinic.",human
"At the neurological examination the patient presented a balance disorder with widening of the sustentation polygon, walking was impossible without help and was heeling, standing was also impossible without help, there was no sensory or motor deficit or cognitive impairment in the patient. On ophthalmological examination, the patient's visual acuity was 8/10 and the fundus was normal. Laboratory evaluations including complete blood count, electrolytes and basic metabolic profile were normal. The patient was investigated by a brain CT scan that showed a cerebellar tumour process with two components; a fleshy component and a cystic component, measuring 70 mm in diameter; this process compresses the 4th ventricle and leads to significant tri-ventricular hydrocephalus with signs of trans-ependymal resorption of cerebrospinal fluid. The exploration was completed by a cerebral MRI which showed a solido-cystic cerebellar tumour process measuring 70*57*60 mm evoking a pilocytic astrocytoma responsible for tonsillar involvement. The patient was then scheduled for surgery, but the surgical removal was partial due to the deep localization of the tumor process and the risk of hemorrhage during the operation. Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. Upon diagnosis of cerebellar hemangioblastoma, the patient underwent a whole-body CT scan for pancreatic, renal or adrenal processes in Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, but the imaging result was without detectable abnormalities, which made it impossible, in addition to the fundus which was initially normal, to talk about Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. As the surgical removal was partial and the patient's clinical symptoms did not improve, the patient was referred to our hospital where he was given three-dimensional conformal external radiotherapy at a total dose of 50,4Gy in 28 fractions, at a daily dose fraction of 1,8Gy, one fraction per day and 5 sessions per week, over 5.6 weeks, using the 3D conformal radiotherapy technique with fields prescribed to the 100% isodose line, using 6-MV photons. We were able to keep the tolerable doses to the organs at risk such as the brain stem, optic chiasma, optic nerves, retina and pituitary within normal limits and at the same time deliver the expected radiation dose to the tumour site. The patient received the planned treatment and the tolerance was good. He was examined weekly during the treatment by our team. No significant side effects were observed, with the exception of grade I alopecia. During the first few weeks of radiotherapy, the patient was put on high-dose corticosteroid therapy and then the dose was gradually reduced until it was stopped, with good tolerance of the radiotherapy until the end of the spread.  The patient was examined after one month and showed a dramatic improvement in balance with no nausea and vomiting, as well as an improvement in visual acuity. A cerebral MRI was done in the patient at 3 months after the end of irradiation which showed a decrease in the size of the cerebellar process.",human
"The physical examination recorded a temperature of 38.5°C. The neurological exam showed a conscious patient well oriented in space and time who had neither meningeal nor vestibular syndrome. A bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve was found associated with bilateral hypo-acousia. However, he had no sensori-motor deficit and no neurological localizing signs. An eye fundus revealed a bilateral stage I papilledema. All others clinical examinations were normal. A basic metabolic panel revealed several abnormalities: an elevated C-reactive protein, lymphopenia, hyper-fibrinogenemia, and anemia (Table 1). A cerebral computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings. However, an audiogram showed bilateral perceptive deafness. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of 350mm of water, protein 0.69 g/L, glucose 0.3mmol/L, and WBC of 60x10 6 /L (80% lymphocytes). An India ink stain was positive for Cryptococcus. CSF and serum cryptococcal antigen tests also returned positive (with titers of 1:10000 and 1:1000 respectively). Blood and CSF culture were positive and revealed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans. The antifungal sensitivity test was also performed (Table 1). Therefore, a diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis was established. The search for a cause of immunodeficiency that would explain this opportunistic infection, in a seemingly immuno-competent patient, was initiated. The serological testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative (CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.5). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed hypo-albuminemia 23.7 g/l (normal range: 37.7-45.6 g/l) with hypogammaglobulinemia 4.5g/l (normal range:6.4-12.7g/l). Immunofixation electrophoresis detected monoclonal IgA-lambda (IgA-λ) paraproteinemia at 0.6 g/l. The urine immunofixation revealed the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria type light chain lambda at 0.4 g/l. The serum level of IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations were measured at 4.04 g/l (normal range: 0.80-3.1), 5.4 (normal range 6.5-15), and 0.45 g/l (normal range: 0.55-3.0) respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the free light chains showed excessively high lambda (λ) chains at 183.14 mg/L (normal range: 5.71-26.3 mg/L) and kappa (κ) chains at 9.47 mg/L (normal range: 3.3-19.4 mg/L) with a κ/λ free light chain ratio of < 0.1 (normal range: 0.26-1.65). May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained bone marrow aspirate smears revealed an infiltration of 12% malignant plasma cells with atypically formed and partly bi-or multi-nucleated cells. The β2-microglobulin was elevated at 3.82 mg/L (normal range: 0.8-3 mg/L). Based on these findings, consistent with the International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of IgA-λ multiple myeloma was determined. The patient was treated for the Cryptococcal infection with amphotericin B at 0.7 mg/kg/day concurrently with flucytosine at 100 mg/kg/day. Repeated CSF drainage was established to reduce CSF pressure. The induction treatment lasted 21 days, after which the CSF fungi culture became negative and the cryptococcal antigen test in serum and CSF both showed a decrease in antigen titers to 1:10. He was then transitioned to oral fluconazole at 800 mg/day for 12 weeks. Upon the second week of consolidation treatment for the infection, the patient's treatment for IgA lambda type multiple myeloma was initiated with a chemotherapy regimen based on thalidomide, melphalan, and prednisone. The evolution was good without complication. No clinical or imaging examination evidence of neurologic complications was found during nine months after this episode.",human
"RNA polymerase III antiantibodies had not been requested. The patient had been clinically stable with mild hypertension of 13.5/8.5 and a normal renal function was noted until 2008 when she was lost to follow. In 2011 the patient consulted again in dermatology department for weight loss and poor health status. The patient was put under treatment with diltiazem 60 mg / day and prednisone 40 mg / day. Four months later the patient was referred to nephrology department for height blood pressure and oliguria. On admission, BP was 230/140 mm Hg and 24 hours urine collection revealed an oliguria with 150 cc / day. Cardiovascular examination showed congestive heart failure and retinal examination disclose a stage III of hypertensive retinopathy. Dipstick urine analysis showed proteinuria of 3+ and a 2 + hematuria. 24 hours proteinuria was 3.5 g. CBC revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia with an Hb of 7g/dl, a thrombocytopenia of 99 000 /mm 3 and 2.5% schisocytes in blood smear. Renal function test was impaired with a creatinine of 156 mg /L and blood urea of 1.76 g/L. a hyperkalemia of 6.7 mEq /L and sodium of 139 mEq /L also detected. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 3 times elevated than normal. Renal sonography showed normal size kidneys with a poor corticomedullary differentiation. The patient was quickly gone under treatment with Nicardipine IV perfusion and hemodialysis. Later the patient was transfused and captopril 25 mg TID instituted. Prednisone started to be tapered and discontinued. After controlling of hypertension and thrombocytopenia correction, a renal needle biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination of biopsy yield specimen showed a partial cortical hemorrhagic necrosis associated with edematous thickening of mesangium extending to the glomerular basement membrane (see Figure 4). The tubulointerstitial involvement was dominated by foci of tubular epithelial necrosis and vascular involvement marked by the presence of arteriolar thrombosis, fibrointimal proliferation and ""onion skin"" lesions. Case N°2 A 32 years old woman without any remarkable past medical history was hospitalized for dyspnea stage IV, low consciousness level without fever and focal neurological signs and sudden onset oliguria, five days after a normal vaginal delivery. The review of systems highlighted a diffuse arthralgia, a Raynaud's phenomenon and a thickening of fingers skin since one a year ago. Physical examination on admission showed a BP of 250/130 mm Hg, a heart rate of 110 bpm, a respiratory rate of 30 cycles /min, temperature 36.5°C, weight 45 kg, beaklike facies, sausage shape fingers and toes associated with salt and pepper hypopigmentation localized on the abdomen and back. Laboratory data revealed a severe renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 48.5mg/l, normocytic anemia to 8.1g/dl associated with thrombocytopenia 80,000 / mm 3 and positive anti-nuclear and anti-scl 70 antibodies. Ultrasonography revealed a poor corticomedullary differentiation, echogenic renal cortices without pelvicalyceal system distention. Chest x ray displayed a cardiomegaly and bilateral reticulonodulaire lesions predominantly in the lower segments of the right lung. Echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction. No central or peripheral vascular calcification was noticed. The patient underwent treatment with captopril and hemodialysis in the same time. The blood pressure decreased but renal functions did not improve. Renal biopsy disclosed a thrombotic microangiopathy. We could not put the patient under immunosuppressive therapy because of patient's low income. After three months of therapy with dialysis, the patient had an ischemic necrosis of the right second toe. Finally the patient was withdrawn from dialysis after a partial recovery of renal function.",human
"She was hemodynamically stable (blood pressure (BP) 130/70 mmHg and had a regular pulse of 88 beats /minute.). She had good color and was slightly polypneic with no peripheral cyanosis (peripheral oxygen saturation 97%). She presented no palpable adenopathy or signs of jugular distension. Cardiac auscultation revealed rhythmic sounds with no murmur or friction rub. There were no signs of peripheral edema or deep vein thrombosis. Pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. On investigation, blood biochemistry, liver, renal function, thyroid function and, hemogram showed no abnormalities except lymphopenia. Her angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level was 132 units (normal range < 68 units). The immunological markers were negative. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) chest scan showed almost complete regression of mediastinal lymphadenopathies without pleuroparenchymal lesion. Respiratory functional tests and bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy were normal. The transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler showed abnormal left ventricular relaxation and systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. In the light of these symptoms and echocardiographic abnormalities, for which other possible causes have been excluded, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis with heart involvement was suspected. Thus, more specialized cardiac evaluation was needed. 24 hour holter monitoring showed recurrent episodes of 2000 monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast showed evidence of delayed hyper enhancement in both the basal and inferolateral left ventricular regions, suspicious for fibrogranulomatous tissue of sarcoidosis. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%. Laboratory tests confirmed negative serial markers of myocardial necrosis. Technetium99m-sestamibi scintigraphy myocardial perfusion study showed decreased uptake in the inferolateral and apical ventricular myocardium, which was reversible during stress (reverse distribution). Coronary angiography and let ventriculography showed angiographically normal coronary arteries. Considering all these clinical and investigatioanal findings in a patient with a history of Lofgren's syndrome and in the absence of primary heart disease, the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was made. The patient started with a dose of 1mg/kg/day of corticosteroids in addition to supportive care. This dose was tapered gradually to a maintenance level of 15 mg per day over 5 months. To this day, evolution was favorable. Case 2 A 48-year-old Tunisian woman, presented to our consultation with a history of intermittent palpitations and exertional dyspnea of 4 months duration, progressively worsening for 2 weeks before, without any history of chest pain or syncope. She had a past history of systemic sarcoidosis diagnosed in April 2009 on the basis of the following compatible clinical and radiologic findings: systemic symptoms (such as fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss), parotid enlargement, negative tuberculin skin test, lymphopenia, hypercalciuria, increased serum ACE level, intrathoracic lymphadenopathies which were hilar, bilateral symmetrical, and associated with right paratracheal window lymph node involvement. Pulmonary functions tests demonstrated decreased volumes and CO diffusing capacity. Lymphocytosis in broncho-alveolar lavage was observed and a CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio was greater than 3.5. Lip biopsy of accessory salivary glands was compatible with grade 1 according to Chisholm's classification. After ruling out the other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, crohn's disease, Wegner granulomatosis..., the diagnosis of systemic sarcoisosis was ascertained. A short-course corticosteroid therapy with antimalarial drug were initiated with a favorable evolution both clinically and radiogically. The patient was presented in November 2011 with a history of intermittent palpitations and exertional dyspnea of 4 months duration, progressively worsening for 2 weeks before. She denied any history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and thyroid disease. She did not smoke, consume alcohol, or illicit drugs. On physical examination, she was conscious, cooperative, and afebrile. She had a BP of 120/70 mmHg and a pulse of 160 beats/minute. There were no signs of cardiac failure; the rest of the physical examination did not reveal any abnormal findings. She was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. The admission ECG showed a ventricular tachycardia at 160 cycles/minute. In the light of these typical symptoms and electrocardiographic alterations in a patient having systematic sarcoidosis, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement was suspected. The echocardiography showed a FE of 50%, bright shadows consisting with infiltration in the basal and inferoseptal ventricular myocardium, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. The cardiac electrophysiology study showed a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by isoproterenol. Laboratory tests showed no relevant alterations in myocardial necrosis biomarkers, blood cell count, renal and liver function, or electrolytes. Given the absence of primary heart disease that would explain the cardiac abnormalities and especially the previous diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis, the final diagnosis was sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement. The patient started with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day of corticosteroid, in addition to supportive care. Over 8 months, the steroids were tapered to a dose of 10 mg/day. Anti arrhythmic drug therapy (Amiodarone) and β blocker were initiated. Given the recurrent ventricular tachycardia with amiodarone, we proceeded to the implantation of an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Evolution was favorable.",human
"She has never practiced contraception. She has been adequately treated for acute pelvic inflammatory disease five years earlier. Her only child is a girl born vaginally seven years ago. Her blood group is B rhesus positive and she has never undergone surgery. She presented with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and the urinary pregnancy test was positive but echography was not yet done. On admission, besides the main complain, the patient had vaginal bleeding and nausea but neither fever, nor vomiting. On physical examination her general condition was good and the blood pressure was 110/70 millimeters of mercury, the respiratory rate: 20 cycles / minute; the pulse rate: 70 pulsations/minute and the temperature: 37.3 degree Celsius. The conjunctivae were pink and the tongue was clean and moist. There were no cervical adenopathies. The breast and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. The abdomen was flat, and mobile with respiration. On palpation there was just a tenderness of the left iliac fossa and the bowel sounds were normal on auscultation. Inspection under speculum revealed normal gravid external cervical os and there was no vaginal discharge. On digital exploration, the cervix was posterior long and closed, the uterus was globular, increased in size and compatible with an eight weeks pregnancy. The left adnexae presented with a tender, smooth and mobile mass of seven centimeters diameter but the right one were normal. The posterior cervico-vaginal fornix was neither tender nor bulging. We suspected a non ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy with the following differentials: heterotopic pregnancy, torsion of ovarian cyst in pregnancy, and intra-cystic ovarian bleeding in pregnancy. Paraclinical investigations revealed: beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β hCG) level of 96 702 milli International Units per milliliter of plasma (mIU/ml). Ultrasonography revealed a heterogenous left ovarian mass of 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus and no peritoneal effusion. This comforted our first diagnosis. After a normal pre-operative work up, an emergency laparotomy was done under general anesthesia. The findings were: left ovary containing a gestational sac and the corpus luteum, normal right adnexae, normal left tube and normal uterus. There was no hemoperitoneum. We dissected the ovarian capsule and carried out ablation of the gestational sac, then we did hemostasis. The specimen was analysed by the pathologist who found decidual cells and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule and thus confirmed the ovarian pregnancy. Post operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged six days after surgery. The ?hCG level decreased and disappeared 25 days after surgery.",human
"On admission, she had a regular pulse rate of 100 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 28/minute and a blood pressure of 164/105mmHg. Apart from the right sided facial nerve palsy, there were no neurologic deficits. Her skin was normal, devoid of any petechial haemorrhage or ecchymosis. She neither had oedema of the feet nor jaundice. She had a non-tender gravid uterus of about 30 weeks, her cervix was 2cm dilated and 40% effaced and foetal heart beats were absent. Examination findings of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable. Urine dipstick had 2+proteinuria and she was hyperglycemic. She was diagnosed to have placenta abruption with intrauterine foetal death, preeclampsia, Bell?s palsy and gestational diabetes, and was put on methyldopa, nifedipine, hydralazine and magnesium sulphate. A sliding scale of regular insulin was also started, and the Shirodkar suture removed. Four hours after admission she had a vaginal delivery of a fresh still birth weighing 1200gm without any congenital abnormalities. The patient had a postpartum haemorrhage of 550mls, which was treated by uterine massage and oxytocin (10units bolus dose followed by an infusion of 40 units in 500 ml of normal saline). No significant retroplacental clots were noted. Investigations done on admission revealed normocytic anaemia (9. 5gm/dL), leucocytosis (17. 3 x 10 3 /µL) and a platelet count of 201. 6 x 10 3 /µ L of blood. Serum creatinine, urea and liver function tests were within normal limits. One day after admission she started complaining of fever, palpitations, blurred vision, dizziness, headache and shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed severe conjunctiva pallor, mild pedal oedema, tachypnoea and a clear chest on auscultation. Cardiovascular examination and echocardiographic findings were unremarkable. Her haemoglobin and platelet count had dropped to 6. 5gm/dL and 86 x 10 3 /µL of blood respectively. Two units of packed red cells were transfused and she was started on antibiotics for suspected septicaemia. On the second day of admission she became anuric with increased facial and bilateral leg swelling. Her laboratory data showed elevated serum creatinine and urea (431µ mol/L and 12. 9mmol/L respectively) and lactate dehydrogenase (1850 IU/L). Her liver enzymes were raised (serum aspartate aminotransferase; 242IU/L and serum alanine aminotransferase; 109IU/L). Based on haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, HELLP syndrome was diagnosed. A consumptive coagulopathy was also considered because of the clinical presentation of fever and haemolysis that followeda stillbirth. The patient was conservatively treated with whole blood and platelet transfusions. Because of falling urinary output magnesium sulphate was withheld and oral nifedipine continued. Two days later the patient was still anuric and her creatinine and urea continued to rise. She was confused, pale with petechial haemorrhage and ecchymosis all over her body. Her platelet count had dropped to 35 ×10 3 /56;L. There was no change in her haemoglobin in spite of blood transfusion. She had a normal coagulation profile (Prothrombin time; 9. 8 seconds, Partial thromboplastin time; 25. 4 seconds and international normalized ratio; 0. 96). Serum D-dimer level was 5. 7µg/mL (normal values < 0. 5µg/mL) and, fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) were found on a peripheral blood smear. In addition, blood cultures were negative. Finally, we suspected TTP-HUS because of worsening haemolysis (falling haemoglobin level, presence of schistocytes, elevated LDH) and thrombocytopenia in spite of supportive therapy. Consumptive coagulopathy was excluded because of normal coagulation indices. She was, therefore, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and started on dexamethasone, supportive measures and haemodialysis. Platelet transfusions were stopped and she received several units of fresh frozen plasma over subsequent days. Three weeks after hospital admission the patient?s clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters had slowly normalized, and she was discharged home in good clinical condition. Subsequent outpatient visits showed no clinical or biochemical deterioration.",human
"The third was fracture of the left humerus, sustained while rehabilitating with a walking frame after surgery for the left femoral and right humeral fractures. The forth was a combination of right femoral and tibia fractures sustained simultaneously while bearing weight on the right lower limb as the leading limb to board a vehicle. Hyperparathyroidism was considered upon the forth occasion. The history of weakness, generalized bone and joint pains preceded the first episode of fracture by about 1 year. He also had production of cloudy urine and history of epigastric pain diagnosed informally as gastritis from chronic ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory He had previously had open reduction and internal fixation for the initial two fractures under general anesthesia He sustained mandibular fracture at intubation. He had been transfused 6 pints of blood on separate occasions. His genotype was AS, he was neither hypertensive nor diabetic. He was on chronic ingestion of calcium and vitamin D supplements. There was no history suggestive of associated thyroid disease and no family history suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplastic syndrome or primary hyperparathryrodism. At first consultation by the general surgeon, physical examination revealed a young man, conscious and alert, in pains, wasted, with a global reduction in muscle bulk. There was frontal bursing and multiple bony swellings on the lower jaw, there was no clinical obvious neck mass. There were healed scars on the right arm and left thigh with reduced range of movement at both shoulders and both hip joints. On the right lower limb, the junction between the upper and middle third of the thigh was swollen, abnormally positioned and tender. There was midshaft swelling of the leg on the same limb, the swelling was soft and tender. There were no bruises or abrasions, and no external bleeding. Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase were markedly elevated (3.17mmol/l and 260 I.U/l respectively). All other electrolytes and haemogram were within normal limits. Scouting X-rays revealed evidence of healed and healing fractures of the jaw and ribs in addition to the clinically obvious long bone fractures. Urinalysis showed 2+ haematuria. Neck ultrasound revealed an enlarged left lower parathyroid gland and the abdominal ultrasound scan showed multiple kidney stones. The serum parathyroid hormone level was 202.8 pmol/l (normal is 1.6-6.9 pmol/l). 99mTc Sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy revealed an increased focal uptake.. He subsequently had excision of the parathyroid mass (left inferior parathyroid) under cervical block and minimal sedation. The mass was grayish-black, measuring 7 by 4cm and weighed 32g. Histology revealed a parathyroid adenoma. Postoperatively he had sudden and persistent symptomatic drop in serum calcium necessitating continuous infusion of calcium gluconate. He is currently 15 months post-surgery, he is being rehabilitated as an outpatient, he is pain free, more mobile and the serum calcium has remained normal.",human
"There was no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. Thyroid gland was not enlarged. His abdomen was soft and flat with no organomegaly. Chest and cardiac examinations revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory findings included a red blood cell count of 4.51 × 10 12 / L; hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl; white blood cell count 16.31 × 10 9 / L; (neutrophils 61.6%; lymphocytes 13.1%; monocytes, 7.0%; eosinophils, 0.1%; basophils, 0.7%); platelet count 308 × 10 9 / L; high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm/h), high C-reactive protein (14.88mg/L), low-serum sodium (129 mmol/L), high-serum potassium (5.4 mmol/L), low serum chloride (92 mmol/L), blood glucose level (118 mg/dl), normal kidney function, normal liver function, low-serum cortisol 8 am (2.9 µg/dL), 4 pm (2.6 µg/dL), TB IgM antibody (?ve), TB IgG antibody (+ve) and positive purified protein derivative test (PPD). A Chest x-ray revealed no abnormalities. A Thoracic lumbar plain film revealed narrowing of the L1- L2 space with irregularity and osteolysis of the endplates suggesting the possibility of lumbar spine TB. An Abdominal CT imaging revealed bilateral adrenal mass like enlargement with irregular enhancement and lesion like changes without calcification. Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings of positive IgG anti-TB antibodies, positive PPD test, High ESR, low serum cortisol, low sodium level and high potassium level, beside the radiological findings of spinal and adrenal involvement, the diagnosis of combined primary adrenal and spinal TB with adrenal insufficiency was highly suggested. Based on this diagnosis, the patient started anti-TB drugs in the form of (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) in combination with vitamin B6 tablets and steroid therapy in the form of prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) in two divided dose of 5 mg in the morning 8 am and 2.5 mg afternoon at 4 pm. He was called for clinical follow up every 6 months and all the necessary investigations were performed each time. In the recent follow up of our patient in 2012, he was without clinical symptoms and all the laboratory investigations were nearly normalized. The anti TB drugs were stopped but steroid therapy in the form of prednisolone is continued with same dose as earlier. The thoracic lumbar plain film taken later in 2012, that we have presented in the article demonstrated nearly the same finding as shown in the earlier film taken during the initial presentation. A CT scan of his adrenal glands documented a relevant reduction of the bilateral adrenal masses and the adrenal lesions were significantly reduced than the earlier CT film along with diminished degree of enhancement, however it is not conclusive about the restoration of its normal adrenal function.",human
"The pain gradually worsened with inability to use the right lower limb. There was associated bluish discolouration of the overlying skin. The patient denied a history of previous trauma or penetrating injury, fever, warmth to touch of the limb, loss of weight or bleeding from other orifices. Neither did the patient consume any anticoagulation therapy, NSAIDS and aspirin, nor did the patient have a previous background of a bleeding disorder or family history of a bleeding disorder. This was the 2 nd episode with a similar episode 4 years ago in 2015 which resolved gradually, the same year he was diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease. The rest of the medical and surgical history was unremarkable. The patient had a significant history of alcohol, drinking approximately 1 to 2 bottles of Whiskey a day during the 9 months prior to this presentation. This followed a period of alcohol cessation after the prior presentation in 2015. At presentation, he had normal blood pressure of 121/68mmHg with a tachycardic of 121beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/ min. He was apyrexial with a temperature of 36.5°C. He was awake and oriented without signs of hepatic encephalopathy and had scleral icterus and leukonychia. Other peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease were absent. His right thigh had pitting oedema extending from the right foot to his gluteus. A circumferential difference of 11 cm measured around the mid-thigh, and 3 cm measured around the calf, compared to the left limb was present. Ecchymosis was present on the posterior thigh, which extended from the gluteal fold to the popliteal fossa. The thigh was severely tender on palpation with decreased range of motion on both active and passive movement. All distal pulses were present. The abdomen was distended with evidence of ascites, liver span of 4cm and no splenomegaly. The examination findings of other systems were normal. The Investigations performed included a complete blood count which showed severe Macrocytic normochromic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 3.60g/L, in addition to thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 37 x 10 9 /L and a reticulocyte production index of 1.1%. The international normalised ratio (INR) was 2,68, a prothrombin time (PT) of 31.30 seconds and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 35.2 seconds. His liver panel showed total protein of 65g/L with hypoalbuminemia of 17g/L. The Total Bilirubin was elevated at 149 umol/L and Direct Bilirubin 48 umol/L. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 19 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 90 IU/L with AST to ALT ratio 4.7suggestive of Alcoholic hepatitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 506 IU/L gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 57 IU/L, C-reactive protein 7.8 mg/l and total white cell count of 10.39x10 9 /L. The patient had a normal urea and creatinine with a hyponatraemia of 128mmol/L. His Iron studies performed revealed Ferritin at 2321.03 ng/ml with serum iron of 6.9 umol/L. His viral screen for hepatitis B and C was negative. A doppler ultrasound illustrated extensive tissue oedema with complex mass extending from the upper thigh to the lower thigh suggestive of a right gastrocnemius haematoma, no thrombus noted in the venous system. The ultrasound of the abdomen showed ascites with an echogenic small liver. The computer tomography angiogram (CT-angio) showed normal non-aneurysmal common iliac, femoral and popliteal arterial vessels. Unfortunately, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was not performed due to local resource constraints. The patient was managed with tranexamic acid 1g eight hourly for a period of 7 days, red cell concentrate (RCC) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions which were repeated over 3 separate days during hospitalization as well vitamin k 10mg titrated against his serial INR measurements. He was given adequate pain relief and thiamine. He was hospitalized for 17 days, during this period the swelling gradually reduced and then maintained a constant size. Health education on his condition and prognosis was explained at which he requested to be transferred to his local hospital for better family support. He was advised to stop alcohol consumption and follow up with a local social worker for long-term alcohol support.",human
"He received parenteral antimalarial treatment (artesunate) with oral relay (artemisinin combination therapy) for 3 days supplemented with an antipyretic.   After 48 hours, the patient remained febrile and three blood cultures were done. Septicaemia dose ceftriaxone was prescribed for 72 hours, yet the fever persisted. Second-line antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin was given for 72 hours with persistent fever. After 06 days, all blood cultures done were sterile. No infectious site was clearly identified and other causes of persistent fever in children, including other inflammatory diseases and haematological malignancies were investigated. Biologic workups showed: a CRP level at 48.11 mg/l, transaminases at 130.40 IU/l (normal < 50) for glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and 40.32 IU/l (normal < 35) for glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), ferritinaemia at 1200.46µg/l (normal: 15-100), elevated LDH at 1576 IU/L (normal 200-500 IU/L) and elevated triglycerides. Rheumatoid and antinuclear factors, anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), blood smear and viral serologies were unremarkable.  The diagnosis of Still disease was made. The patient received one-month dose regressive corticosteroid therapy, combined with methotrexate from the second week. The fever completely regressed twelve hours after the start of corticosteroid therapy, and the patient's clinical state improved considerably. Case 2 A 10 years old boy was admitted for a 10 days duration persistent fever and asthenia. He described an odynophagia from two days prior to the onset of fever. His past medical history was unremarkable. The physical examination revealed an altered general state, a temperature of 39°C, no sign of meningeal irritation and no clinically evident portal of entry. He had a class II splenomegaly, with micro polyadenopathies located at the inguinal region and adjoin the upper right cervical chain, with good oral hygiene. A walking lameness occurred on the 8 th day with painful mobilization of the right hip. He had received a well-conducted outpatient anti-malaria treatment and probabilistic antibiotherapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ceftriaxone at the correct dose.  Biologically there was a severe inflammatory syndrome with sedimentation rate at 94mm/h, CRP at 96mg/l, leucocytosis at 13000/mm 3 with neutrophil polynucleosis, ferritinaemia elevated to 1100 microgram/l, (normal: 15-100), the 3 sets of blood cultures were sterile and the arthrocentesis fluid was inflammatory and sterile. Viral serologies [hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)] were negative. Triglycerides were increased at 2g/l, LDH levels at 1000IU/l (normal 200-500IU/l). Liver and kidney functions were satisfactory, the calcium phosphate levels were normal and the cytobacteriological examination of urine was unremarkable. The rheumatoid and antinuclear factors were negative. The chest X-ray showed no infection site, the right hip ultrasound showed intra-articular effusion and the abdominal ultrasound found no lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of Still disease was made.  As soon as the first dose of corticosteroids was administered at 1mg/kg, there was a regression of the fever within 24 hours. In addition to corticosteroid therapy, bedrest was recommended during periods of relapses with a diet low in salt, sugar, fat, and the gradual addition of methotrexate at a low dose (10 mg/m 2 of body surface area). With this treatment, the progression was favourable.",human
"The patient was known to be hypertensive for the past 5 years on daily Losartan 50 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. He worked on a cruise ship as a welder for many years. On general examination he was found to be alert, dyspneic (RR = 30 cycles/min), desaturating to 89% on room air, and febrile (38.2°C) with a heart rate of 112 beats/min. The patient was moderately pale with scleral jaundice and bilateral pitting lower limb edema; an erythematous patch on the anterior aspect of the right leg was noted which measured around 4 cm x 3 cm that was warm and tender to touch. On respiratory system examination the patient had a normal chest cage with the trachea centrally located. Fine crepitations were auscultated bilaterally from the midzone to bases. On abdominal examination there was uniform distension with an everted umbilicus and mild tenderness was elicited on deep palpation of the right hypochondrium. The liver span was 12 cm and the spleen was not palpable. Initial blood work done revealed a markedly elevated white count of 31.4 K/μL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.0 g/dL, an elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) of 221.48 mg/dL, Procalcitonin (PCT) of 61 ng/mL and D-Dimer of 6.74 μg/mL. He had an elevated direct bilirubin of 23.32 μmol/L but otherwise normal liver and renal function. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 30 mm/hr. HIV was negative, as was blood serology and stool microscopy for Amoeba. An initial chest x-ray revealed parenchymal infiltrates likely of infective etiology and subsequent radiological workup showed metastatic abscesses in the lungs, liver, lower limb muscle and subcutaneous tissue as well as bone marrow changes suggestive of osteomyelitis. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed multiple non-enhancing cystic liver lesions with largest measuring 3.6 x 3.2 cm. Doppler ultrasound for both limbs were suggestive of superficial as well as deep vein thrombosis. CT-pulmonary angiography revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. CT of the brain showed only mild cortical atrophy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and was placed on 10L/min of supplemental oxygen with a non-rebreather mask and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The initial antibiotic regimen included intravenous (IV) Imipenem with Cilastatin and Metronidazole. He was also empirically started on antifungal therapy on the suspicion of a disseminated fungal infection however, after the first dose of Amphotericin-B he developed an anaphylactic response and this was therefore discontinued. For deep vein thrombosis, he was initially started on therapeutic doses of subcutaneous Enoxaparin and then switched to oral Rivaroxaban. During his stay the patient reported complete loss of vision in the left eye. Fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography revealed features suggestive endogenous endophthalmitis. He also developed acute worsening of his breathlessness which was attributed to an NSTEMI based on elevated cardiac markers. Coronary angiography was essentially normal, while 2D echocardiography revealed septal hypertrophy with no regional wall motion abnormality. Blood cultures eventually grew Klebsiella pneumoniae which was sensitive to Ceftriaxone. He was given intravitreal Vancomycin 1000 mg and continued on oral ciprofloxacin for endophthalmitis. Gradually the patient improved, with resolution of fevers and difficulty breathing with significant drop in his infectious markers. After a 25 day stay in the hospital, he was discharged home and to continue follow up in his native country. On discharge we recommended IV ceftriaxone for another 4 weeks or until radiological resolution of the abscesses was detected.",human
"The exit wound was located in the medial aspect of the left knee. Other external genitalia were normal in inspection. He had no urethral meatus bleeding, but he had a laceration in the left leg. Blood profile tests such as complete blood cell, electrolyte profile, liver function test and coagulation test were normal; there was just a rise in WBC (white blood cell) 14000mg/dl. A focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma (FAST) did not reveal any free fluid in the abdominal cavity. A plain film of the left leg showed a small fracture in the talus bone. After resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the operation room for urgent scrotal exploration. The patient was informed that an orchiectomy might be required if his testis cannot be repaired. After that, emergency scrotal exploration was done; about 200ml of the hematoma was evacuated, tunica vaginalis and both testes were exposed and completely damaged, and some gunshot fragment was identified and removed. Then, the scrotum was irrigated with 3000ml of normal saline. Debridement of necrotic testicular tissue was subsequently preformed. However, the ruptured testis could not be closed primarily because the extruded seminiferous tubules and the big tissue defect of the tunica albuginea did not allow the apposition of the tunica albugineal edges. Therefore, closure of the tunica albuginea using tunica vaginalis as a graft tissue was done (the free edges of the parietal tunica vaginalis was used to create neocapsulae around the testis parenchymal tissue) by using Vicryl suture bilaterally, and the drain was left in situ. Skin was closed with nylon 3/0. It should be mentioned that vas deference and epididymis were damaged, and we recommended the delayed repair of vas deference and epididymis with microsurgical procedure. Finally, Foley catheter Fr 16 was inserted. The laceration of the left leg was irrigated with 2000ml of normal saline and repaired by an orthoptist. During the same admission, the patient received ceftriaxone 2 gram daily and was under the joint care by the orthopedist. The drain and catheter were removed three-days post-operatively. The patient was discharged one-week later with outpatient follow up. Additionally, a three-week course of cephalexin and ibuprofen was recommended for the patient. Unfortunately, during post-operative period there were some complications in orthopedic and urologic procedures, such as fever and discharge from the site of operation. Additionally, the left testis was not viable and there was a need for orchiectomy during the follow up of one week. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography at 4 months showed a viable right testis with minimal atrophic change. Four months after the surgery, the patient had normal erection and the anorchide serum hormone concentration such as (serum testosterone level was 6.27ng/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 120.3nl/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) 63.69nl/ml and the prolactin level was 11.05ng/ml), which show that the patient had borderline normal hormonal profile. The semen analysis showed the total sperm count: 12 million, volume: 2.5cc, motility: nonviable and normal forms: 70% and the patient was happy with the cosmetic results. Ethical consideration: the patient gave their written informed consent for participation in our study.",human
"This presentation limited his normal daily chaos. He has not received much improvement from the usual topical and oral medication which he has been taking from since past the illness started. The review of other system was unremarkable. He does not have diabetes mellitus, endocrinological nor any autoimmune disorder. He is retroviral status non-reactive and neither does he have any infectious disease like tuberculosis, syphilis, hepatitis A, B, C. He has a positive family his of similar clinical presentation in the late mother. He was febrile to touch with axillary temperature of 38.0°C and other vitals where within normal range. Dermatological exam reviewed, diffuse edematous dark erythematous lesions seen in both axillaries and groins as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Erythematous lesions had associated erosions, crusts, blisters, pigmentation, and scale at friction sites, accompanied by pain, itching, and malodor. Erosive surfaces left by the ulceration of blisters to be seen with a small amount of exudation and scab on the surface. Nikolsky's sign was positive. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. He was treated as Hailey-Hailey disease in view of the positive family history in mother, characteristic lesions in suspect flexure areas, relapsing course, nature of the illness and the referring clinicians’ diagnosis. However, he did not show the classical asymptomatic linear, white bands in the nail plates as documented by many authors [9]. We did not do a biopsy and PCR for genetic mutation of ATP2C1 to confirm diagnosis due to financial constraints. All radiologic investigations were normal. The patient was empirically initiated on both topical and systemic agents for disease modifying and symptomatic treatment: injectable glycyrrhizin acid, analgesic-codeine phosphate, anti-histamine; cetirizine for symptomatic relief and topical cefoperazone tazobactam in view of the fevers. Day 3 on this cocktail showed little improvement in disease improvement with blood test results suggesting that the disease is in active stage thus, an immunomodulator, azathioprine orally was added to the regimen. Other supporting drugs where directed by laboratory findings. For hypoalbuminemia, he was advised on a high-quality protein diet and fluid ingestion in view of the high uric levels. Most supportive investigations done where unremarkable as indicated in Table 1. Of note was the raised markers of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 64mm/hour, positive skin exudation culture for Streptococcus agalactis, monocytosis of 15.6% monocyte absolute value: 1.15 x 10 9 /L. He also had hypokalemia and hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobuminemia. Laboratory biochemistry tests, complete blood count, serum viral screen, autoimmune screen; ANA+ENA, ANCA spectrum, GM antibody determination and rheumatoid factor, TORCH screen infections, potassium hydroxide scrapping for fungal, fungi 1-3-B-D dextran quantitative G test, Stool and urine analysis were unremarkable. The patient showed much improvement after day 5 on azathioprine and he was treated as outpatient on the same cocktail with a 2 weekly supply of the immunomodulator as indicated in Figure 3, Figure 4.",human
"There was adequate keratinized tissue present on the lingual aspect after crown lengthening procedure. No osseous reduction was required [2].  Two weeks after crown lengthening, the canals were prepared using no. 2 and no. 3 peso-reamers in mesio-buccal and distal canal respectively. A direct pattern was made using GC Pattern Resin and a Prefabricated no. 2 MANI Post. The pattern was made with the prefabricated post in the mesio-buccal canal. After the resin has set, the prefabricated post was rotated and removed from the resin post and core. The resin pattern was carefully removed from the distal canal after it had set completely. The pattern was casted using semi-precious alloy. Both, the pre-fabricated post and the finished cast past was sand blasted using 50 microns aluminum oxide. Also a small slot was prepared on the prefabricated post at the occlusal level of the cast-core. This was done to felicitate easy removal of the occlusal excess without using any rotary tools, as the vibrations caused by the rotary instruments to cut off the excess pre-fabricated post, may loosen the bond of the unset cement Figure 2, Figure 3.  The tooth was isolated using a rubber dam. The tooth was treated using 37% phosphoric acid. The canals were rinsed and dried using distilled water and paper points. The cement used was resin modified GIC [3]. The cement was dispensed using dispensing tips into both the prepared canals. The cast post was coated with some more cement and seated into the tooth. The pre-fabricated post was also immediately pushed into the mesio-buccal canal before the cement had passed its working time. The cement was allowed to set for 5 minutes. After the initial set had occurred, the excess part of the prefabricated post was tilted and broken off from the assembly. The slot made at the occlusal level provided an easy means to cut the excess off and allowed the patient to occlude.  Tooth preparation procedure : post cementation, after 48 hours, the patient was recalled. Tooth preparation was done during this appointment. The margins chosen were chamfer on distal, lingual and buccal aspect Figure 4, Figure 5.  A knife edge margin was chosen on the mesial aspect. Studies claim that the zirconia preparation with no margin and a sub-gingival margin has a very good longitivity [4]. Modern day zirconia allows the clinician to have margins as thin as 0.2 mm. Also the highly polished zirconia facilitates hemi-desmosomal attachment with the gingiva. This also prevents marginal leakage Figure 6.",human
"She did not complain of any symptoms at that time. After observing the MRI, she was taking methotrexate because of her scleroderma in 2015 in Toronto. Her past medical history showed a very limited scleroderma involving her left scalp and a little bit of the left side of her face. There was no skin involvement elsewhere and she denied any symptoms or history of systemic sclerosis. She just highlighted she suffered malnutrition when she was a child. She referred allergy to penicillin.  She was followed with CT angiogram and an MRI was done in February 2016. The CT angiogram did not show any vessel abnormality. Figure 2 shows the features that were discovered on the MRI sequences. The patient had a second MRI done on May 2016, which showed a stable lesion. She was visited in the clinic and she did not complain of any new symptoms. She had a repeat MRI every year and on May 2017 the intraaxial lesion showed a mild increase in size of the lesion. The post contrast MRI showed a tiny enhancing nodule along the lateral margin of the lesion. When the patient was seen again in the clinic on September 2017, she complained of mild sensory changes on her right side that have been around for several years and so, wanted the intraaxial lesion to be removed; however, this symptom had not changed recently as she referred. Neurological exam at that time showed GCS 15, motor strength was 5/5 on both upper and lower extremities and reflexes were present, no focal neurological changes were discovered. No sensory deficiency was noticed. The head of plastic surgery was asked to review the case as well as to attend the operating room for an evaluation of the superficial approach for optimum scalp incisional planning and we decided we would stay to the medial side with the opening of the scalp to include a broad-based craniotomy flap that contained this abnormality of the scalp to optimize healing. The patient was informed about the risks of surgery, accepting them and signing the informed consent. The patient was subsequently brought in the operation theatre for a left frontal craniotomy. The incision was planned with the help of plastic surgeons to incorporate the abnormality in the scalp flap with a broad base. Intraoperatively, we used neuronavigation and ultrasound to locate the tumor which was placed below the scalp lesion and skull defect. Brain needle was then used under direct guidance to tap the cyst with hemorrhagic fluid which looked chronic and sent for cell count and analysis. The cyst wall was resected which looked like there was a deposit of hemosiderin. Two areas of nodularity were seen, one was consistent with the ultrasound and was removed. It looked like a thrombosed vein or hemangioblastoma nodule principally. All specimens were sent to pathology for evaluation. Then, the cavity was inspected under the microscope view and no other nodule was visible. A gross total resection was achieved. The examination of the histopathology sections showed white matter containing multiple blood vessels of irregular outline with paper-thin walls lacking smooth muscle and lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. Some of the vessels were obsolete and replaced by hyalinised connective tissue. The white matter demonstrated severe piloid gliosis with numerous Rosenthal fibers. Multiple clusters of hemosiderin-laden macrophages were scattered throughout. CD34 highlighted the thin walled blood vessels. No neoplastic abnormalities were present. Final diagnosis was a cavernous angioma.",human
"Genetic analysis found a homozygous p.Gly379Val (c.1136G>T) mutation in exon 7 of the CYP11B1 gene.  During his follow-up, grade 3 hypertension was discovered at the age of 25 associated with hypokalemia treated by Calcium channel blocker (amlodipine 10 mg q.d.) and Beta-blocker (atenolol 50 mg q.d.). It has been complicated only by hypertensive retinopathy grade 1.  The patient was treated by hydrocortisone 25mg b.i.d. Acute adrenal deficiency didn't occur during the follow-up despite bad compliance of the treatment. He presented some episodes of abdominal pain that was alleviated after the correction of hypokalemia. Spironolactone 50 mg q.d. was prescribed later, at the age of 36, due to persistent hypokalemia.  Progressive weight gain was observed since the age of 25 passing from 64 Kg to 90 Kg at the age of 36. He had a metabolic syndrome with an android fat distribution (waist circumference = 102 cm) and low HDL level (Table 2). External genitalia examination and bone density were normal. The patient was married and he had two healthy children aging respectively of three and one-year-old. Patient 2: a 35-year-old female (46, XX) was diagnosed with 11β-OHD at the neonatal age. The disease was revealed by the virilization of the external genitalia which was corrected surgically.  The patient had a normal blood pressure during her regular check-up despite the presence of hypokalemia (Table 2). She was treated initially by hydrocortisone 30 mg b.i.d. and she didn't have during her follow-up an acute adrenal deficiency.  She had metabolic syndrome, class I obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) since the age of 28. The diagnosis of PCOS was considered regarding the presence of spaniomenorrhea, clinical (hirsutism, alopecia) and biological (testosterone level = 6.2 ng/ml) hyperandrogenism. The patient's weight increased from 75 Kg at the age of 28 to 94 Kg at the age of 32, date of which the dose of hydrocortisone was decreased to 20 mg b.i.d. She had since lost 8 Kg and had normal menstrual cycles. Her bone density was normal two years ago. Spironolactone was also introduced due to persistent hypokalemia. Patient 3: a 33-year-old female (46, XX) was diagnosed with 11β-OHD prenatally. Her mother was treated during pregnancy with dexamethasone. However, since she had also virilization of the external genitalia, she was operated on at the neonatal age. Genetic analysis found the same mutation as her brother, patient 1.  The patient had an irregular follow-up and she was treated initially by hydrocortisone 30 mg b.i.d. She didn't have a history of acute adrenal deficiency. Her menarche was at the age of 12. She had PCOS with hirsutism and irregular cycles, treated by estrogen therapy (estradiol 2 mg q.d.) associated with cyproterone acetate 50 mg q.d.  At the age of 32, the patient was admitted for sore throat and repeated vomiting. Her body temperature was 38°C. she had a normal body mass index and a blood pressure of 120/90 mm Hg. She received amoxicillin 3 g t.i.d. for tonsillitis. Biochemical analysis revealed hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/L) without electrocardiographic changes. She was treated initially by intravenous potassium chloride then by an oral solution.  Hypokalemia persisted after the withdrawal of potassium substitution and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring revealed a mean systolic blood pressure of 169 mm Hg and a mean diastolic blood pressure of 116 mm Hg. The patient was discharged later with spironolactone 50 mg q.d. Patient 4: a male patient diagnosed also with 11β-OHD. The disease was revealed at the age of 2 by peripheral precocious puberty. He didn't have a genetic analysis. He died at the age of 12 by a postoperative infection following an orthopedic surgery for scoliosis.   The remaining family members were not known to have CAH and they have not yet benefited from genetic analysis. His sister (patient 5), aged 28, married, mother of a boy and a girl, all in good health. The other sister (patient 6), 21 years old, was following in psychiatry for depression.",human
"Physician in the ward, thought that this frustrated angry behavior was due to patient`s dissatisfaction of rehabilitation achievements. Detailed review found no prior psychiatric history, history of substance abuse and known exposure to neuroleptics. Patient had one previous episode of urinary tract infections (UTI) during his hospital stay that required treatment with oral antibiotics. On the first day of assessment, the patient`s initial signs and symptoms included a temperature of 38.4°C, agitated and combative behavior, refusing medication (including muscle relaxants) and oral intake and progressively deteriorating sleep. The provisional diagnosis was delirium due to a recurrent UTI. Olanzapine 10 mg IM stat was given and urinalysis (UA) was ordered. On the following day, (UA) revealed evidence of urinary tract bacterial infection for which an intravenous antibiotic was commenced. On the same day the patient continued to have agitated combative behavior for which he received haloperidol 10 mg IM in the afternoon (which calmed him down). On the third day the patient demonstrated a clear change in his mental state. His agitation decreased, however he began to show perplexed affect, distractibility and poor initiation of purposeful behavior. He was immobile and unresponsive, staring and not responding to verbal commands but responding to pain with purposeful withdrawal. Assessment of central nervous system (CNS) was difficult as the patient was constantly moving and had generalized spasticity. He responded to questions by uttering a few words and became very agitated, shouting obscenities. Laboratory results done on the same day showed the following results: white blood cell count: 18.2 cells/ml, serum creatinine: 93 µmol/L, fasting blood glucose : 8.37 mmol/l, calcium :2.59 mmol/l, phosphorus : 1.79 mmol/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) :162 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) :76 U/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT): 157 U/L, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level : 4731 IU/L. The urine output was low at 350ml/12h. The patient was started on hydration and immediately transferred to ICU with differential diagnoses that included NMS and meningitis. Early the next morning the patient had a complex partial seizure which ceased after IV diazepam administration. Lumbar puncture (LP), computerized tomography (CT) of the head and electroencephalogram (EEG) did not indicate any significant findings. The diagnosis of NMS was retained, and the patient was started on bromocriptine 7.5 mg three times daily and lorazepam 1 mg at bedtime. On the 5th day after the (ICU) admission the patient demonstrated decreased rigidity and agitation and increased periods of wakefulness. On the 6th day patient regained a full level of orientation and cooperation. Liver function tests and CPK normalized and patient was transferred to the general ward.",human
"Past medical history included Henoch-Schönlein purpura during childhood. Social history included smoking (11 pack-years), family history was non-contributory. She had no known drug allergies. Complete blood count revealed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 23.400 /lt). A CT scan revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, small hepatic enlargement, Gerota's fascia thickening, perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening and small bubbles of air. Fournier's gangrene was set as working diagnosis (calculated FGSI 8, UFGSI 10 and LRINEC 7) and the patient was transported to operation room for immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Blood and surgical material was taken for microbiologic analysis. Due to the extent of the surgical debridement, the patient was admitted postoperatively to the ICU (SOFA score 6, APACHE II score 12); where sedation (midazolam 30 mcg/kg/hr c.iv), analgesia (fentanyl 3 mcg/kg/min c.iv), triple antibiotic regimen with meropenem 2gr q8h i.v., clindamycin 600mg q 6h i.v. and daptomycin 500mg q.d. i.v., gastroprotective and antithrombotic prophylaxis were initiated. During the next 3 days a second CT and an obstetrical consultation were conducted with no significant findings. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic screen were also negative. Yet, the patient remained febrile. Microbiology cultures from material taken from the surgical trauma area revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumonia ; hence antibiotic regimen was modified and antimycotic treatment (caspofungin 100mg q.d. i.v.) was initiated too. Debridements were repeated every 24 hours but due to the extent of the lesions, on the 10 th day, the patient was transported to operation room for temporary ileostomy till the end of the therapy. Percutaneous tracheotomy was also performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available at the setting. One day after the second surgery, patient's condition complicated with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia. Along with that, a localized oedema appeared in her left upper limb. A palpable mass along the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was also noticed. Vascular ultrasound examination revealed occlusion of left internal jugular vein. Transcranial Doppler examination was normal. Dental consultation and examination of soft palate and peritonsilar tissues showed no abnormalities. Linezolide 600 mg q12h i.v. was added to antibiotic regimen. Since debridements were going on, simultaneous anticoagulation therapy was started with only bemiparine 2500 b.i.d. s.c. Gradually, the patient became afebrile and her clinical condition improved. She was discharged from ICU 13 days later. A follow-up CTA confirmed the disappearance of the left jugular vein thrombosis. About a month after her ICU discharge, an operation was performed for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of the right gluteal region. On a follow-up examination 6 months later, the young woman had returned to her normal everyday life.",human
"On further probe on his childhood history, his mother reported that he was born normally at home by a Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) in one of the Internally Displaced peoples (IDP) camps in 2000. She reported that there was an uneventful pregnancy which was carried to term and delivery by Spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD). She reported that during her pregnancy, she had exclusive feeding on the relief food provided by WFP (beans, yellow posho and cooking oil) during the IDP camps and denies history of ingestion of herbs or medications which caused adverse events during and after the pregnancy. She reported that her child had a normal physical, cognitive and social childhood development before the onset of nodding which began in May 27th 2011 immediately after returning home from IDP camps. The child was enrolled in Atanga treatment centre and was being managed with Carbamazepine, multivitamins and Ivermectin. She reported that in spite of these medications the child continued to have seizures and nodding at least twice a day and had since dropped out of school. On general examination, he was dehydrated, febrile and moderately wasted. There was a right lumbar region mass, tender, indurated and non-fluctuant. The spleen and liver were not palpable. There was no renal or supra-pubic tenderness. The rectum was full of faecal material which was of normal colour and consistency. The anal tone was normal and there was no blood on examining fingure. Haematological investigations were conducted and showed neutrophilia, lympocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. There were immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral film report. Other laboratory results including liver function tests (ALT, AST) were elevated while serum protein levels were low; renal functions tests (serum creatinine, blood urea and nitrogen level), and serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Cl-, HC03-) which were within normal ranges. Abdominal Ultrasound showed inflamed internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The patient underwent incision and drainage at Gulu Hospital and wound left open for 14days and thereafter secondary wound closure was conducted. He received supplementary food rehabilitation and his seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate 200mg once a day under direct observation therapy (DOTS) and close monitoring of the vital signs. The patient continued to have regular follow up in the surgical ward; seizures and nodding stopped completely from the time of intervention in the hospital. With these interventions for over one month the child had no seizures nor nodding and the child returned to normal life. A subsequent review of the haematological and clinical chemistry findings 2 weeks later showed that renal function tests, serum electrolytes were normal except the liver enzymes level were elevated and were still high (table 1).",human
"At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

"Her past medical history reveals asthma attacks that were treated as they occurred. Her last asthma attack happened over a year ago. She is primipara with a healthy child. The first episodes of palpitations occurred in July 2011 with a normal electrocardiogram. She was not pregnant then. Cardiovascular examination is normal with a heart rate of 84 bpm, no heart murmur nor signs of heart failure. Blood pressure while lying down and standing up is 120/70 mmHg on her right arm and 110/60 mmHg on her left. Examination of other organs is normal. The 12-lead surface ECG is normal with regular sinus rhythm at 81 bpm and a normal adjusted QT interval. Doppler echocardiography is normal. Systolic function of both ventricles was preserved (LVEF = 70%; TAPSE = 23 mm). For instance, there is no left or right ventricular hypertrophy or dilation. 24-hoursHolter ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 88 bpm without rhythm or conduction disorders.  Her electrolytes, creatinine, blood count, blood glucose and ultra-sensitive TSH are normal except for hypomagnesemia at 0.50 mmol. She is prescribed six tablets a day of magnesium for a week, and atenolol 25 mg per day. Driving is not recommended. A control of her metabolic panel, realized on November 3, 2011 is normal. Her lipothymia symptoms reoccurred on November 22, 2011, after a three weeks amendment. A 24-hours Holter ECG performed on November 23, 2011 is in sinus rhythm at 96 bpm, revealed many ventricular extrasystoles with R/T phenomenon. These extrasystoles included 30 doublets and six attacks of unsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). She is prescribed amiodarone 200 mg daily which is quickly replaced by atenolol 50 mg and 100 mg causing the symptoms to subside. On January 25 th, 2012, she reported chest tightness lasting less than a minute without palpitations or lipothymia. The patient is two months pregnant. Cardiac examination is normal. Troponin is negative and lipid profile is normal. Atenolol treatment is continued at 100 mg/day. On March 26 th, 2012, Mrs. AMS is four months pregnant and is admitted to the emergency room for lipothymia, discomfort, and dizziness preceded by palpitations. She is anxious. Cardiac examination and blood pressure are normal. Pregnancy has a normal course. A surface ECG records a monomorphic VT attack such as a left conduction slowness that was unsustained but rapid. Thyroid hormones, blood electrolytes, glucose, creatinine and blood count were normal. She was hospitalized in intensive care under ECG monitoring through a scope that recorded many unsustained VT attacks. Her treatment consisted potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate through an electric pump, the substitution of 100 mg atenolol by 200 mg acebutolol, and enoxaparin for primary prevention of venous thromboembolic disease. Ventricular tachycardia attacks persisted under this treatment. Replacement of acebutolol by nadolol brought her back to normal sinus rhythm and she was discharged on the third day of hospitalization. An outpatient Holter ECG was performed on 03/28/2012 recorded ventricular extrasystoles numerous unsustained VT attacks and rare supraventricular extrasystoles. She is readmitted on March 30 th, 2012, for the same symptoms. A Holter ECG revealed frequent monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles (1287) of which 318 unsustained VT attacks. The combination of 100 mg flecainide (1/2 tablet three times per day) with 80 mg nadolol (1/4 tablet twice à day) controlled the arrhythmia and she was discharged on the tenth day of hospitalization. Under this treatment and oral solution of magnesium sulfate a Holter ECG monitoring revealed a marked improvement in monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles with only three doublets and one unsustained ventricular attack. Mrs. AMS is then transferred to another country where advanced technology electrophysiological study confirmed the infundibular type of her VT. She is successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation. Antiarrhythmic drugs are discontinued. At 27 months post-ablation Ms. AMS is doing well. She has had a vaginal delivery of a full term healthy child with no cardiac complication before undergoing radiofrequency.",human
"g/dl, Amylase: 1523 U/L, Lipase: 1254 U/L, Wbc: 5060 mm 3, Hct: 38.4%, Platelet:109.000 mm 3 Prothrombrin time: 14 sec, AFP:4.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive. In his abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and portal vein doppler USG, the liver had a cirrhotic appearance and splenomegaly was found. His gastroscopy revealed grade III esophageal varicosis. His dynamic contrasted abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) showed intrahepatic bile ducts dillated, choledoch normal, acute pancreatitis and in fourth segment of the left lobe of the liver a mass without typical wash-out but intense contrast in the arterial phase with a size of 10x8 cm and his MR angiography showed thrombus on the portal vein left branch. The result of mass biopsy was reported as focal nodular hyperplasia. Tenofovir was started and his endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a mass with a diameter of 10 cm and thrombus on the portal vein in the left lobe of the liver. Biopsy was taken from the thrombus with 25 G FNA needle. The biopsy showed big irregular atypical cells in groups some of which were distributed alone and in some places looked like trabecular structures and he was diagnosed as HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control. Case 2 50-year-old male patient. The patient had been receiving antiviral treatment for 13 years with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B and he was under control. Five years ago, a mass with a diameter of 2 cm was found in the eighth segment of the liver. The patient was operated and his pathology was reported as HCC. The patient who developed abdominal pain in his follow-ups was hospitalized. The patient had no peculiarity in his anamnesis and family history. He had been using tenofovir 245 mg/day and had been smoking for 10 package/years. His physical examination was normal. His laboratory findings were as follows: Glucose: 86 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dl, AST: 92 U/L, ALT: 89 U/L, ALP: 139 U/L, GGT: 386 U/L, LDH:162 U/L, Total bilirubin: 6.3 mg/dl, Conjugated bilirubin: 6.0 mg/dl, Albumin:3.2 g/dl, Wbc: 5060 mm 3, Hct: 38.4%, Platelet:109.000 mm 3, Prothrombrin time: 14 sec, AFP:4.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive, HBV DNA: negative. His abdominal tomography (AT) showed a solid mass with a regular contour in the left lobe of the liver next to the lateral segment anterior. The mass had extrahepatic location, it had a size of 80x52 mm, it had a heterogeneous inner structure, it had intense contrast at arterial phase but it did not have typical wash-out. AT angiography showed thrombus at the portal vein left branch. The patient underwent EUS and biopsy was taken from the mass on the left lobe of the liver with 22 G needle and FNA biopsy was taken from the thrombus on the portal vein with 25G needle. The biopsy results of both the mass in the liver and the thrombus were HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control. Case 3 77-year-old male patient. The patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B four years ago and started lamivudin 100 mg/day. The patient who did not come to his controls was hospitalized with complaints of swellings on the legs, asthenia and pain in joints. The patient had no peculiarity in his anamnesis and family history and he was not smoking or drinking. His physical examination revealed faintness, moderate edema, 2 cm splenomegaly and arthritis on the left toe and left ankle. His laboratory findings were as follows: Glucose: 86 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dl, AST: 81 U/L, ALT: 95 U/L, ALP: 56 U/L, GGT: 28 U/L, LDH:217 U/L, Total bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dl, Conjugated bilirubin: 0.5 mg/dl,Albumin:3.3g/dl,Wbc:4550mm 3, Hct: 30.2%, Platelet:213.000mm 3, Prothrombrin time: 18 sec, AFP:1.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive, HBV DNA: 1.270.000 IU, Anti delta total (+) and HDV RNA (-). His abdominal MR showed cirrhotic liver, a mass lesion with a size of 70x45 mm on the seventh segment of the right lobe. T1A examination showed that the central of the mass lesion was hyperintense, its periphery was hypointense; postcontrasted examination showed that it did not show an obvious contrast but it showed diffusion limits. In the eighth segment of the right lobe of the liver, a centrally located 25x20 mm lesion was seen which extended to the inferior vena cava and caused tumor thrombus in the vena cava. EUS showed masses with diameters of 7 cm and 2 cm on the seventh and eighth segments of the liver and thrombus that extended to the vena cava inferior. Biopsy was taken from the thrombus with 25 G FNA needle. Biopsy result showed HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control.",human
