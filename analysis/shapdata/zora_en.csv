"In this introduction, the article begins by discussing the concept of working memory (WM), which is a fundamental cognitive function responsible for briefly holding information for further processing. It refers to a study conducted by Baddeley in 1966 that showed how phonological similarity between items in a list can lead to confusion errors in recall tasks.  The article explains that when participants are asked to remember lists of words and recall them in order, they tend to make more errors with phonologically similar lists like ""rat, fat, mat"" compared to semantically similar lists like ""leopard, cheetah, lion"". This observation suggests that phonological similarity plays a significant role in the short-term maintenance of serial/positional information.  The researchers go on to state that their study aims to comprehensively test the conditions under which semantic similarity might also induce confusion errors. They investigate whether semantic and phonological information have different impacts on maintaining serial order information in WM.  To support their investigation, they introduce models that postulate item-context binding as a mechanism for maintaining an item's position within WM. These models suggest that items (e.g., words) are bound to contexts (e.g., word positions within a list). The researchers highlight Figure 1 as an illustration of this item-context binding assumption.  The article acknowledges previous modeling work suggesting that item-context bindings are essential components of working memory for both verbal and visual-spatial arrays. However, it also notes that confusion errors can occur with these bindings. In particular, confusion errors related to order (i.e., recalling words from the correct list but in the wrong positions) are more likely between adjacent serial positions than distant ones.  It is important to distinguish order errors from item errors where participants fail to recall an item altogether. Confusion errors reflect failures of distinctly binding each item to its context and will be the focus of examination regarding the role of phonological and semantic representations in the binding process. The role of item memory will be discussed separately.  The article emphasizes the impact of similarity on confusion errors, highlighting the phonological similarity effect as one of the best-studied examples. This effect shows that phonologically similar items are more likely to be confused than dissimilar ones, indicating that the phonological representation of items is bound to positional contexts in WM. The increased confusability induced by similarity is seen across different domains such as auditory and visual tasks, suggesting it is a general property of working memory.  The introduction concludes by noting that confusion errors can be attributed to a discriminability problem. Regardless of the specific representational format used during item-context binding, confusion errors tend to occur when it becomes difficult to discriminate between similar pieces of information.  Overall, this introduction provides background information on working memory and its association with confusion errors related to phonological and semantic similarity. It highlights the research gap concerning clarifying how these types of similarity affect item-context binding and aims to address this gap through comprehensive testing. In the rest of the article, the authors delve into their methodology and findings related to semantic similarity and confusion errors. They first outline their experimental design, which involved presenting participants with lists of words varying in semantic similarity. Participants were then instructed to recall the words in their original order.  The researchers found that while phonological similarity consistently led to confusion errors, semantic similarity did not reliably induce such errors. This finding contradicts previous assumptions that both types of similarity would result in similar rates of confusion errors.  To further investigate this discrepancy, the authors conducted additional analyses exploring factors that might influence how semantic similarity impacts item-context binding. They explored variables such as list length and category-relatedness between items within a list.  Interestingly, they discovered that while longer lists generally led to increased confusion errors overall, semantically similar lists showed a greater reduction in these errors with increasing list length compared to semantically dissimilar lists. This finding suggests that longer lists may provide more contextual cues for distinguishing between semantically similar items during recall.  The researchers also examined whether category-relatedness influenced confusion errors within semantically similar lists. They found evidence suggesting that when items within a list belonged to distinct categories (e.g., ""cat,"" ""dog,"" ""fish""), participants experienced fewer confusion errors compared to when items belonged to the same general category (e.g., ""cup,"" ""plate,"" ""fork"").  These results suggest that semantic information does play a role in item-context binding but its impact differs from phonological information. While phonological similarity consistently leads to higher rates of confusion errors, variations in semantic relatedness and contextual cues can modulate the effects of semantic similarity on item-context binding and subsequent recall accuracy.  The article concludes by discussing implications for theoretical models of working memory and proposing future research directions. The findings challenge existing models by highlighting differential roles for phonological and semantic representations in maintaining serial order information.  Additionally, the authors suggest investigating how other factors like individual differences in cognitive abilities, language proficiency, and familiarity with semantic relationships might influence the effects of semantic similarity on confusion errors.  Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between similarity, item-context binding, and confusion errors in working memory. By specifically focusing on semantic similarity and its impact on recall accuracy, the research advances our understanding of how different types of information are processed and maintained within working memory.",explain
"The introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS) language spoken in Switzerland and highlights the lack of research on this particular heritage language. It states that BCMS is one of the most widespread heritage languages in Switzerland, with approximately 2.4% of the Swiss population speaking it daily.  Despite the growing body of research on heritage languages and BCMS spoken in other German-speaking countries, there has been limited investigation into the BCMS spoken specifically in Switzerland. One major challenge faced by researchers studying heritage varieties is obtaining authentic data, often resulting in case studies based on online communications between peers.  The article emphasizes that one area lacking research resources for studying BCMS heritage varieties is corpora of spoken language since heritage speakers predominantly use their mother tongue orally. To overcome this limitation, a map task corpus was created by students at the University of Zurich to enhance the study of BCMS as a heritage language.  The map task corpus consists of data collected from second-generation speakers with parents born in former Yugoslavia. The exercises undertaken by students included fieldwork, transcription, linguistic annotation, and analysis of selected phenomena found within collected data. The aim was to train students to conduct empirical studies on spoken language.  In order to present this corpus to a broader audience and provide a prototype for accessing such types of spoken data, an interactive platform was created. This platform allows users to preselect transcripts based on metadata and frequency distribution features while also sorting and filtering counts within the corpus. Additionally, users can search annotated turn-aligned transcripts and add or export their own custom annotations.  The creation of this corpus not only offers a valuable resource for linguists investigating heritage BCMS but also serves as an example for visualizing, structuring, and accessing similar kinds of spoken language data. By addressing user-specific differentiation when accessing spoken corpora through its architecture, this prototype caters to the needs of different user groups.  It is noted that migration from former Yugoslavian countries to Switzerland began in the 1960s when the official language was known as Serbo-Croatian. However, Serbo-Croatian has never been entirely uniform and had variations such as Eastern and Western varieties, as well as Bosnian-Herzegovinian and Montenegrin standard-language expressions. After Yugoslavia's breakup, new standard languages were codified from what was formerly known as Serbo-Croatian – Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Montenegrin.  While BCMS is a commonly used term in the linguistic community to denote this language(s), there are debates on whether it should be considered one language or separate languages depending on definitions and approaches taken. For consistency purposes within this paper, BCMS is used to refer to these language(s), although data from Montenegro's variety is not included.  Overall, this introduction sets the context for understanding the significance of investigating heritage BCMS in Switzerland through the creation of a map task corpus. It outlines its aims, methodology for data collection and analysis conducted by students at the University of Zurich while highlighting its relevance for researchers and learners of BCMS abroad.",explain
"The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically focusing on their unique word structures and boundaries. It begins by referencing various characterizations that have been attributed to these languages, such as having a ""sentence word,"" a strong group accent, or being weakly polysynthetic. These descriptions highlight the presence of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives in Insular Celtic languages.  However, the introduction points out that these broad descriptions often lack specific criteria for defining ""wordhood"" or ""phonological autonomy."" It also notes that contemporary native grammars do not offer a definition of wordhood in relation to these languages. For example, early Irish grammars did not have a concept equivalent to the modern notion of a ""word,"" instead using the term ""focal"" to refer to any kind of syntactic group. Similarly, Middle Welsh grammars provide little information about words, defining them as combinations of syllables comprising correct utterances.  To address this lack of clarity around wordhood in Insular Celtic languages, this study aims to investigate the properties resembling words within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The use of poetry is also mentioned as a means to explore differences between genres or gain additional insights beyond what prose provides.  The introduction justifies its focus on finite verbal structures by citing Dixon and Aikhenvald's observation that patterns pertaining to wordhood may vary across different parts of speech within a given language. In Middle Welsh, it defines the verbal complex as encompassing both the finite verb and its satellites (modifiers). The example given includes eight markers within this complex: subordinating conjunction (can-), negative marker (ny-), object marker (-y), resultative marker (ry-), lexical root (wel-), tense-aspect-mood marker (-s-), agreement-TAM marker (-ei), and a bound pronoun (-ef).  The article's organization is outlined in the final part of the introduction. Section 2 explains the approach taken in the study, while Section 3 delves into the morphological structure of the verbal complex. Section 4 focuses on phonological and prosodic processes within this complex, aligning them with the morphological structure discussed previously. The findings and potential future avenues for research are summarized and discussed in Section 5.  Overall, this introduction sets up the context for understanding why wordhood is a topic worth exploring within Insular Celtic languages, particularly Middle Welsh prose, and provides an outline for how the rest of the article will proceed in its investigation. In continuing to explain this Zora article, it is important to highlight the motivations and significance of the study. The introduction establishes that there are no clear criteria or definitions for wordhood in Insular Celtic languages, which creates a gap in linguistic understanding. By focusing on the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, the study aims to provide a detailed analysis of its potential word-like properties.  The choice to examine Middle Welsh prose from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries is likely due to the availability of manuscripts from this period. These texts offer valuable insights into the structure and composition of language during that time period. Additionally, incorporating poetry as a comparative genre allows for exploration of any distinctive features or variations between different forms of expression within Middle Welsh.  The introduction highlights the presence of various markers within the verbal complex, such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and P- and T-markers. Each marker serves a specific function within this complex structure. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these markers and their implications for wordhood in Middle Welsh prose, an examination will be conducted in more detail in Section 3.  Section 2 is dedicated to explaining the approach adopted by this study. This section could potentially outline any theoretical frameworks or methodologies employed by researchers involved in examining wordhood patterns across languages or related studies on Celtic languages specifically.  As mentioned earlier, Section 3 focuses on exploring morphological structuring within the verbal complex. This investigation likely seeks to determine how words interact with one another phonologically and morphologically within Insular Celtic languages' unique linguistic framework.  Additionally, Section 4 delves into phonological and prosodic processes present within the verbal complex while aligning them with morphological structures discussed earlier. This analysis aims to uncover how phonetic elements interact with each other when forming words or constructing meaningful expressions.  Finally, Section 5 summarizes and discusses findings achieved throughout this study regarding wordhood characteristics observed within Middle Welsh prose from fourteenth and early fifteenth-century manuscripts. It is likely to address the implications of these findings, their limitations, and potential avenues for further research. This final section also serves as a concluding remark that ties together the overall work done in exploring wordhood in Insular Celtic languages.  In summary, this Zora article seeks to contribute to linguistic understanding by examining the properties resembling words within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose. Through detailed analysis, it aims to shed light on wordhood patterns and structures within Insular Celtic languages that have lacked clear definitions or criteria historically.",explain
"The introduction of this Zora article begins by discussing the importance of being fluent in multiple foreign languages, particularly in Europe. The author mentions that teaching foreign languages alongside English as a global language poses a challenge, as learning English can negatively affect students' motivation to learn other languages. This phenomenon appears to be common across Europe, as multiple studies have found that students typically report lower value beliefs and motivation for languages other than English.  The introduction then highlights the need for more research on the longitudinal relations between students' motivation for multiple languages. It is noted that individual differences exist in students' motivational beliefs depending on factors such as gender, language background, and experience with learning several languages at home.  To address these gaps in knowledge, the present study focuses on upper secondary students' academic language learning in Switzerland—a historically multilingual country. The unique linguistic context of Switzerland provides an opportunity to understand how students' prior linguistic knowledge may be related to their motivation to learn several languages.  The study specifically investigates the longitudinal relationship between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English (a foreign language), French (a foreign but national language), and German (the native language) from Grades 9 to 11. The researchers also explore potential relations between the development of value beliefs and students' linguistic background (monolingual vs. multilingual).  To delve deeper into the understanding of motivation for learning new languages, the study draws upon the concept of value beliefs—i.e., how much value individuals attribute to engaging in a certain task or activity. Value beliefs are considered particularly important for predicting language learning motivation.  The introduction mentions some commonly used models—socioeducational model, self-determination theory, second-language motivational self-system (L2MSS), and expectancy-value theory—and their shared focus on differentiating between motivational beliefs arising from within individuals or influenced by external factors like parental influence.  Expectancy-value theory is highlighted as it suggests that a student's value beliefs, such as intrinsic value (personal interest or enjoyment) and attainment value (personal importance of doing well), can predict their learning approach and strategies. The article also notes that studies based on expectancy-value theory have found positive correlations between students' value beliefs and persistence, intention to continue learning a new language, and achievement.  Regarding the development of value beliefs over time, the introduction points out that numerous studies grounded in expectancy-value theory have observed an average decline in students' value beliefs across academic domains—particularly during late childhood and adolescence. It is also mentioned that some studies have identified different longitudinal relations between value facets in various academic subjects.  However, it is noted that there is still a gap in educational research regarding whether and how certain value beliefs may interact with each other over time and across multiple language subjects.  Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of understanding students' motivation for learning multiple languages, specifically within the context of Switzerland. It also introduces key theoretical frameworks and identifies gaps in previous research that this study aims to address.",explain
"The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, specifically focusing on the concept of ""diglossia."" Diglossia refers to a situation where two distinct varieties of a language are used in different contexts.  In this case, the two context-dependent varieties used in German-speaking Switzerland are Alemannic dialects (referred to as Swiss German or Mundart) for oral communication, and Swiss Standard German (SSG or Schriftdeutsch) for written communication. The author states that while everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, SSG is learned at school. It is worth noting that both ALM and SSG can be used to some extent in each other's domain, and Swiss people tend to code-switch between the two languages quickly.  The article mentions that contact between these two varieties is inevitable, leading to interferences on various linguistic levels such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. However, when it comes specifically to vowels—the focus of this study—there have been limited acoustic studies on ALM dialects while more research exists on SSG vowels based on acoustic measurements.  The current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects (from Bern [BE], Chur [GR], Brig [VS], and Zurich [ZH]) as well as their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. The goal is to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of long vowels produced by speakers from these regions. An important aspect researchers want to understand is how much influence speakers' dialect has on determining SSG vowel qualities.  Before delving into the research questions and hypotheses guiding this study, the article briefly describes ALM dialects and SSG variations spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. It highlights three subgroups within ALM: Low ALM found only in Basel city; High ALM comprising northern half dialects; and Highest ALM spoken in the alpine southern half of German-speaking Switzerland.  The division between High and Highest ALM is defined by several isoglosses, linguistic phenomena that create geographical boundaries for specific language features. For instance, one famous isogloss studied here is hiatus diphthongisation, which refers to the development of a diphthong in Old High German (OHG) hiatus positions in the northern half (High ALM), while the southern half (Highest ALM) maintains a monophthong. The example given is how the verb ""to build"" in standard German (bauen)is traditionally pronounced as [»b8ou9.´] in High ALM and [»b8u˘.´] in Highest ALM.  However, despite these clear north-south divisions, there are also variations within dialect groups based on an east-west divide indicated by multiple phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses. One example mentioned includes /l/-vocalisation as a phonetic phenomenon that separates western parts from eastern parts of this region.  Overall, when considering both north-south and east-west divides along with their overlaps, this study reveals that German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions.  In summary, this Zora article's introduction sets the stage for investigating vowel qualities in Swiss German dialects by explaining diglossic language use and highlighting previous research gaps regarding acoustic studies on Alemannic dialects. It also provides an overview of relevant linguistic divisions within these dialects to guide readers' understanding throughout the study.",explain
"This introduction highlights the importance of imitation in human behavior, particularly in relation to language development and social communication. The authors state that imitation is a powerful learning mechanism for individuals across the lifespan, from infants to adults. They explain that previous research has focused on different aspects of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation), but rarely assessed them together.  The authors emphasize that their study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on young preschoolers, a group that has not been extensively studied in terms of their imitation abilities. They also highlight the novelty of their investigation into the relationship between different types of imitation and linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children.  The introduction then provides a brief review of previous studies that have explored the relationship between imitative behaviors and language development or sociopragmatic abilities. These studies have shown that spontaneous and elicited imitative behaviors are crucial for various aspects of language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication skills.  The authors cite specific studies to support their claims. For example, Bates et al. (1979) found a strong link between vocal imitation (imitating sounds and words) at 9-13 months old and language production/comprehension at this stage of development. They also refer to Hanika and Boyer (2019), who demonstrated a unique relationship between motor imitation behaviors (clapping hands or pushing toy cars) at 15-18 months old and language comprehension skills.  Additionally, they mention Carpenter et al.'s study (1998), which observed a positive correlation between infants' ability to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects at around 9-15 months old with their later use of referential language. Other studies discussed cover topics such as lexical development related to word imitation frequency at 13 months old (Masur & Eichorst, 2002) or correlations between vocal/gestural adult imitations at 14 months old with language skills at 20 months (Snow, 1989).  The authors also highlight the importance of imitation in sociopragmatic skills, such as social communication. They refer to a longitudinal study by Dohmen et al. (2016) that found an association between imitative behaviors and later language outcomes in German-speaking late-talking children. Another study discussed involves children with language impairment (LI), who showed weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitation patterns compared to typically developing peers (Wray et al., 2017).  The introduction concludes by noting the scarcity of studies explicitly comparing the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills. Stone et al.'s study (1997) suggested that the imitation of socially relevant body movements was more predictive of expressive language skills, while the imitation of actions on objects was associated with play skills.  Other researchers have also reported similar findings regarding communicative gestures and facial expressions being more accurately imitated than non-communicative movements or facial expressions with weak social engagement links (Masur & Ritz, 1984; Rogers et al., 2003). Lastly, Ingersoll and Lalonde's work (2010) emphasized the beneficial role of gesture imitation tasks over object-based imitation tasks in language therapy settings for older children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Overall, this introduction sets up the rationale for the present study by highlighting gaps in previous research on different types of imitation skills and their relationship to linguistic and pragmatic abilities in preschool children. The authors provide a comprehensive review of previous studies to support their arguments and demonstrate the significance of their own investigation into multimodal aspects of imitation.",explain
"In this introduction, the authors discuss the concept of framing as a popular theoretical approach in communication research. They point out that while many studies refer to framing, they often fail to provide clear definitions of the concept, leading to a range of phenomena being categorized under the umbrella term of framing. This lack of clarity complicates attempts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.  To overcome these problems, systematic reviews are employed to identify common trends, locate research gaps, and guide future research. However, previous reviews have not fully utilized one unique characteristic of the framing approach: its bridging potential. The authors explain that framing is able to consider all aspects of the communication process and bridge different interdisciplinary perspectives such as strategic communication by various actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting processes, audience frames and effects, as well as broader cultural contexts.  The authors reference Entman's (1993) frame locations in the communication process which include communicators or sources of messages, the text or message itself,the receiver or audience and their interpretations,and finally culture or societal influences on framing. They argue that systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across these frame locations can provide insights into the cultural repository of frames.  Choosing a specific topic for review is ideal when examining a cultural framing repository with many available studies. In this case,Mario is focused on climate change because it is one of today's most important global issues.The complexity and scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change make it difficult for audiences to engage with and understand.In addition,the required connections between experts,policy makers,sources,and audiences makes effective communication about climate change crucial.Framing has potential here due tocertain barriers being present.Researchers also expect that studying framing can aid in developing effective communication strategies,builiding consensus among target audiences,and supporting actions against climate change.  Given that there has been steady growth in research on framing within climate change communication specifically,this systematic review will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers in the field. It will assess frames used by communicators,journalists,the frame content itself and its impact on audiences, as well as framing effects.  The authors note that systematic reviews on framing in communication research overall are limited,so there is an opportunity to identify if field-specific applications of framing are present.To do this,the study will compare findings from the review on climate change communication with those of reviews covering framing in general communication research.  The objective of this study is to connect research on frame production,frame content,audience frames,and framing effects.As a result,indications about the cultural framing repository can be achieved. The authors mention that a misfit refers to subsequent studies not identifying or relating to the same frames identified previously. This gap needs attention and addressing for closing the climate change communication cycle.  To achieve these goals,the study will combine quantitative and qualitative approaches by conducting content analysis of 25 years' worth of published literature on climate change framing This Zora article introduces a study that aims to systematically review the concept of framing in the context of climate change communication. The authors argue that framing is an important theoretical approach in communication research, but its application needs to be better understood and defined.  The article highlights the need for clear definitions of framing, as different studies often use the term without providing specific explanations. This lack of clarity leads to a range of phenomena being grouped under the concept of framing, which makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.  To address this issue, systematic reviews are suggested as a way to identify common trends, locate research gaps, and guide future studies. However, previous reviews have not fully utilized one key aspect of framing: its bridging potential. Framing has the ability to consider all aspects of communication processes and bridge interdisciplinary perspectives ranging from strategic communication by various actors to journalistic cognitions and reporting processes.  The authors refer to Entman's frame locations, highlighting how framing can occur at multiple points in the communication process: by communicators (sources), within messages themselves (text), through receivers (audiences), and within broader cultural contexts. They argue that exploring how framing is applied across these frame locations can provide insights into the cultural repository from which frames emerge.  Climate change is chosen as the focal topic for this study due to its importance on a global scale. Despite audiences relying on various sources for information about climate change, they still find it challenging to engage with and understand. Frames play a crucial role in shaping audiences' perception and support for actions related to climate change.  Furthermore,the complexity and scientific uncertainties surrounding climate change make effective communication even more essential.These barriers necessitate using framing strategies that can ""break through"" such challenges.In addition,researchers believe studying how frames are used in communicating about climate change can contribute towards developing effective strategies,buidling consensus,and supporting actions against climate change.  The article notes that there has been a growing body of research on framing in climate change communication. Conducting a systematic review will consolidate this research and provide valuable insights for future studies in the field.  Importantly, the study aims to connect different areas of framing research, including frame production by communicators and journalists, frame content itself, audience frames, and framing effects. By identifying the most salient frames across these locations, the study seeks to understand the cultural framing repository and highlight any potential conceptual misfit that may exist within different frame locations.  The article acknowledges that systematic reviews of framing in communication research overall are limited. Hence,integrating field-specific insights from this climate change study can contribute to bridging that gap. This comparison will shed light on any field-specific applications within framing as well as have broader implications for communication research as a whole.  To achieve their objectives,the study plans to use both quantitative and qualitative approaches by conducting content analysis of published literature on climate change framing dating back 25 years.  Overall,this Zora article sets out the rationale for conducting a systematic review on framing in climate change communication. It highlights the importance of clarifying definitions and understanding how frames operate across various aspects of communication processes.It also emphasizes addressing gaps in existing literature by comparing findings with other areas of communication research.This study aims to provide valuable insights into effective climate change communication strategies by examining how different stakeholders utilize frames at various stages.",explain
"This introduction discusses the importance of understanding different conceptualizations of nature and landscapes across languages and knowledge systems. It specifically highlights the implications of these differences for environmental governance, policy-making, and management decisions.  The paragraph begins by referencing a recent report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which emphasized the diversity of worldviews and knowledge systems about nature. One way to explore this variation is through language, as it reveals similarities and differences in how landscapes are conceptualized.  Studies of indigenous languages have shown that these linguistic differences can have significant consequences for human-environment relations. For example, incorrect labeling or classification of land cover types based on Western concepts can lead to misguided management decisions that impact traditional land use practices.  Despite growing recognition of the need to capture multiple perspectives in environmental governance policies, there is often an assumption that language equivalence exists across different languages. The example given is the European Landscape Convention, which has official translations into 41 additional languages but fails to account for potential differences in the concept of ""landscape"" across these languages.  Similarly, international initiatives such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals define targets and indicators based on specific terms like ""forest."" However, linguistic variations surrounding these terms suggest that there may not be a unitary underlying concept across different languages. This variability ultimately affects global measurements related to forests at large scales.  The privileging of English as a dominant language in both science and policy further adds challenges for global initiatives. The article raises important questions about whether previous research examining isolated concepts like ""landscape"" or ""forest"" also applies to more systematic exploration within entire semantic fields.  To address this gap in understanding cross-linguistic differences within semantic domains related to waterbodies, this study focuses on English and German speakers' mental representations associated with water-related terms. By exploring sensory, motor, and emotional associations with such terms individually as well as within each language's domain, the researchers aim to gain insight into the meanings of these terms.  This investigation is particularly relevant because water is essential to life and plays a crucial role in landscape preference. However, differences in the meaning of water-related terms, such as ""lake"" in English and its equivalent ""loch"" in Gaelic that encompasses both fresh and saltwater bodies, pose challenges for public understanding and implementation of indicators related to water quality.  The choice to compare English with German stems from their linguistic relationship as Germanic languages within the Indo-European family. Moreover, German offers advantages such as being well-documented with large corpora available and allowing for demographically comparable participant samples alongside English-speaking participants from the UK. This Zora article aims to delve into the differences in conceptualizations of waterbodies between English and German speakers. It recognizes the importance of understanding these distinctions, especially in the context of environmental governance and policy implementation.  The study focuses on sensory, motor, and emotional associations that individuals have with terms related to waterbodies. By exploring these associations, the researchers hope to shed light on how these concepts are understood and represented by English and German speakers.  The authors highlight that sensory, motor, and emotional ratings play a significant role in language use and can predict behavioral responses to words. Therefore, examining these associations can provide valuable insights into how people mentally represent water-related terms across languages.  Water holds a vital place in explanations of landscape preference as it is not only crucial for life but also plays a key role in Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 6.3.2 aimed at monitoring improvements in water quality. The United Nations Environment Programme provides detailed delineation for rivers, lakes, groundwater — collectively referred to as waterbodies.  However, this assumes that there is a shared understanding of what constitutes a ""waterbody"" across different languages. The article raises concerns about potential discrepancies between the meanings assigned to such terms by local populations due to linguistic variations.  For instance, while ""lake"" typically refers to enclosed freshwater bodies within English-speaking communities, Gaelic encompasses both enclosed freshwater bodies as well as those open to the sea with its equivalent term ""loch."" These differing interpretations have significant implications for how indicators are understood and implemented at national levels.  To tackle this issue comprehensively using cross-linguistic comparison as their focal point for investigation; English – given its central role in scientific work and policy documents – was selected alongside German—another Germanic language closely related but differing from English with respect to word meanings across various domains.  Furthermore, the choice of German offers advantages such as abundant documentation resources like large corpora available for analysis along with the possibility of sampling demographically comparable participants from Germany and Switzerland to match the English-speaking sample.  In summary, this Zora article sets out to explore the divergent conceptualizations of waterbodies between English and German speakers. It highlights the relevance of understanding these differences, as they can impact environmental governance decision-making and policy implementation. By examining sensory, motor, and emotional associations with water-related terms, the study aims to uncover insights into how these concepts are mentally represented across languages.",explain
"This introduction discusses the concept of reference in conversation and explores the changes that occur in referring expressions (REs) over the course of interactive communication. Reference is a fundamental aspect of communication, where speakers refer to entities relevant to their interaction. The most commonly used form of reference is a noun phrase (NP) RE, which can take various forms such as pronouns, definite and indefinite descriptions, and proper nouns.  During interactive communication, two main changes can be observed in NP REs: lexical convergence and referential contraction. Lexical convergence refers to speakers aligning on their linguistic representations, leading to increased similarity in terms of vocabulary choice and grammatical constructions employed. This process has been explained with the Interactive Alignment Model. Referential contraction refers to interlocutors shortening their contributions by using more concise NP REs.  The focus of this article is primarily on referential contraction but acknowledges that both processes typically occur simultaneously. The author aims to describe central trends of structural change-in-interaction specifically related to shortening NP REs produced over multiple rounds of dialogue.  To investigate these changes-in-interaction, a referential communication task was designed where participants engaged in spoken dialogues over four rounds while referencing the same sets of visual stimuli. The article provides an example from this task illustrating how NP REs evolve from longer initial forms into shortened versions through iterative rounds.  The study examines how speakers converge on particular expressions and shorten their NP REs by analyzing preferred grammatical structures used throughout the interaction. It focuses on identifying general tendencies regarding types and forms of modifying elements within NP RE constructions.  In contrast with previous research that discussed change-in-interaction related to compression in NPs, this study delves into experimental approaches incorporating familiarity and accessibility considerations along with theoretical frameworks like the Interactive Alignment Model.  Section 3 introduces the experimental setup used for collecting spoken English dialogues that form a corpus for analysis. Section 4 presents an analysis highlighting structural changes in NP REs over the course of dialogical interactions. It shows that as NP REs are shortened, there is a shift from more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms.  Section 5 discusses the findings with regard to the notion of compression as proposed by Biber and Clark (2002). Compression refers to changes occurring in response to the demand for conveying a significant amount of information efficiently, particularly when targeting an expert audience.  Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the research questions addressed in this article and briefly outlines the methodology and key findings related to changes observed in NP REs during interactive communication. In Section 2, the article dives into previous research on change-in-interaction, specifically focusing on the compression of NP REs. This literature review contextualizes the findings from experimental studies related to referential communication tasks within theoretical frameworks such as the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility. By incorporating these theories, the article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how NP REs undergo structural changes during interactive communication.  Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up employed in this study to gather a corpus of spoken English dialogues. The details of this methodology are not mentioned in the introduction but will likely be explored further in that section. It is important to note that this experimental design allows for an analysis specifically focused on how NP REs evolve over successive rounds of interaction.  Moving forward, Section 4 presents an in-depth analysis of the structural changes observed within NP REs throughout these dialogical interactions. By examining patterns and trends across multiple rounds, this analysis provides valuable insights into how speakers modify their preferred grammatical structure for NP REs as they align with each other linguistically and shorten their expressions.  The results reveal an interesting trajectory: initial NP REs tend to possess post-head clausal elements but gradually shift towards phrasal (pre-)modification as interaction progresses. Biber and Clark (2002) term this phenomenon ""compression"". It encompasses both shortening processes in general and shifts from clausal elements towards more concise phrasal forms specifically observed here.  In Section 5, these findings are further discussed within Biber and Clark's concept of compression as an efficient response to convey large amounts of information effectively. The discussion explores how language users adapt their linguistic structures based on demands imposed by specific audiences or contexts.  It is expected that subsequent sections beyond what is covered in the introduction would also delve into additional analyses or discussions related to other aspects considered in this study.  Overall, this Zora article offers a thorough exploration of the changes-in-interaction that occur within NP REs during interactive communication. By examining the shortening processes and shifts in structural preferences, the study not only contributes to our understanding of language usage but also sheds light on how speakers adapt their expressions to facilitate efficient communication.",explain
"The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of Francoprovençal, a Gallo-Romance language that is currently classified as non-standardized and highly endangered. It states that the language is spoken by approximately 110,000 to 160,000 speakers in France, Switzerland, and Italy.  The article highlights that Francoprovençal has never been the official language of any administrative entity and has not undergone standardization. It also notes that all speakers of Francoprovençal are bilingual, with most Swiss varieties spoken by individuals older than 70 years. However, there is an exception in Evolène in the canton Valais, Switzerland, where the local variety of Francoprovençal is still transmitted to younger generations.  In Italy's Aosta Valley region, successful language policies have promoted the use of Francoprovençal and consequently maintained competent native speakers across different age groups.  The introduction further emphasizes that Francoprovençal acts as a ""bridge"" between French, Occitan (another Romance language), and Italian dialects both geographically and typologically. However, it points out that despite its significance as a linguistic intermediary between these languages, research on its morphological or syntactic properties remains relatively limited. The article references Diémoz's work on subject pronouns as an example of existing research on these aspects.  It then introduces the binational project initiated since 2018 which focuses on investigating so-called ""partitive articles"" (PA) in various Francoprovençal varieties alongside Northern Italian Dialects (NIDs). The aim of this project is to enhance understanding regarding the nominal morphosyntax (i.e., word structure) within different types of Francoprovençal varieties.  An earlier study by Kristol highlighted differences among French-speaking Swiss and Italian varieties into two distinct types: ""Francoprovençal A"" comprising Western Valais (Switzerland) and Northern varieties (in France and Switzerland), and ""Francoprovençal B"" including Southern Francoprovençal spoken in France, Eastern Valais (Switzerland), and Aosta Valley (Italy).  According to Kristol's research, Francoprovençal A varieties exhibit gender distinction on plural definite articles (masculine 'lu(z)' versus feminine 'le(z)'), similar to Ibero-Romance systems. Additionally, they possess a fully-fledged PA akin to French. However, PAs in Francoprovençal A are also found after quantifiers/quantity expressions such as 'beaucoup' ('a lot') and under the scope of sentential negation, distinguishing it from French.  On the other hand, Francoprovençal B varieties lack gender distinction on plural definite articles like French but unlike Italian. Instead, these varieties consist of an obligatory invariable 'DE' for indefinite mass singulars as well as indefinite plurals. The article notes that optional allomorph ""de-[z]"" occurs before a vocalic onset in the plural. Furthermore, some localities within the Francoprovençal B area (e.g., eastern Valais) preserve remnants of an older subject versus oblique case system when using singular definite articles.  In conclusion, this article primarily focuses on exploring the different features of nominal morphology in two main types of Francoprovençal languages which are summarized in Table 1 provided in the text. The specific focus is given to property illustrated by examples (1) and (2), where nouns preceded by a PA or the invariable 'DE' are examined.  Overall Word Count: 446 words In this Zora article, the subsequent sections will delve into a detailed exploration of the first property mentioned in the introduction – the use of partitive articles (PA) and the invariable 'DE' within Francoprovençal varieties.  The article aims to contribute to a better understanding of the nominal morphosyntax of Francoprovençal by comparing it with Northern Italian Dialects. By focusing on PA usage, researchers seek to uncover similarities and differences between these languages, shedding light on their unique linguistic features.  The study builds upon previous research conducted by Kristol, who divided Francoprovençal into two distinct types: ""Francoprovençal A"" and ""Francoprovençal B."" These types differ in various aspects of nominal morphology, including gender distinction on plural definite articles and the presence or absence of specific forms like PAs.  By analyzing examples such as (1) where the noun 'kwəˈzən' ('cousins') is preceded by a PA and (2) where 'te' ('tea') is preceded by an invariable 'DE', this study aims to further elucidate how these morphological properties are manifested within different contexts and regions.  Moreover, this investigation seeks to expand existing knowledge beyond Diémoz's prior research on subject pronouns. It aims to explore other aspects of morphological or syntactic properties that have received relatively less attention thus far. By doing so, it intends to make important contributions toward filling gaps in our understanding of Francoprovençal's linguistics landscape.  Overall, through comprehensive analysis and comparison between Francoprovençal varieties and Northern Italian Dialects within this binational project initiated since 2018, linguists collaborate to enhance our comprehension regarding nominal morphosyntax. Further exploration will help unravel intricate details related to partitive articles and other grammatical structures present within different subtypes of Francoprovençal.  The article not only provides significant insights into the linguistic properties of a highly endangered and non-standardized language but also contributes to the broader field of Romance linguistics. By examining this unique bridge language between French, Occitan, and Italian dialects, researchers gain valuable knowledge regarding language contact phenomena, typological variation, and historical linguistic developments inherent within these interconnected languages.  In conclusion, this Zora article represents an important endeavor to better understand Francoprovençal's morphological and syntactic characteristics. The focus on partitive articles and their usage in different Francoprovençal subtypes offers a valuable contribution to both theoretical linguistics and preserving the heritage of a threatened Gallo-Romance language.

"Working memory refers to the cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information in mind. It plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes, such as learning, problem-solving, and language comprehension. One common method used to test working memory is immediate serial recall tasks where individuals are asked to remember and repeat a sequence of words or numbers in the order they were presented.  One robust finding in immediate serial recall tasks is the phonological-similarity effect. This effect refers to the phenomenon where participants are more likely to make errors when recalling word lists that have phonologically similar items (e.g., cat, fat, mat). The presence of this effect suggests that phonology plays an important role in how we encode and maintain the serial order of items in working memory.  On the other hand, semantic similarity between items typically does not have a negative impact on recall performance. For example, if participants need to remember a list of fruits such as apple, banana, and orange - similarity based on their shared semantic category does not lead to increased errors.  The discrepancy between phonological similarity having a detrimental impact on recall performance while semantic similarity does not has raised questions about how verbal working memory encodes different types of information. To address this discrepancy and gain a better understanding of how positional information is retained in working memory with respect to phonology and semantics, several experiments were conducted.  In these experiments involving young adults from various populations (Ns = 60), researchers manipulated both between-item semantic and phonological similarity while participants performed tasks that required them to form new item-context bindings in working memory. Specifically, participants needed to retrieve either the context from its associated item or vice versa.  The results consistently showed that phonological similarity had an adverse effect on working memory for item-context bindings across all experiments regardless of whether retrieval was item-to-context or context-to-item. When two words had similar sound patterns or rhymed with each other (e.g., cat vs. mat), participants were more likely to make errors in recalling the correct order or binding of items with their respective contexts.  In contrast, semantic similarity had no significant impact on recall performance for item-context bindings. Even when participants had to remember and retrieve semantically similar items, such as different types of fruits or animals, there was no observable decline in recall accuracy.  Based on these findings, the researchers propose a working memory model that can account for the effects of semantic similarity. According to this model, semantic knowledge acts as support for working memory through activated long-term memory representations. The relationships between semantically related items are thought to be encoded and retained in long-term memory rather than being actively maintained within working memory itself.  In conclusion, verbal working memory encodes phonological and semantic information differently when it comes to retaining positional information in various tasks. Phonological similarity consistently impairs recall performance for item-context bindings across experiments while semantic similarity has little to no effect. These findings provide new insights into how different types of information are processed and represented within working memory systems.",continue
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of heritage languages, which are languages spoken by immigrant communities or their descendants in a new linguistic environment. Such languages often undergo changes and adaptations as they are passed down through generations. This process is particularly fascinating in the case of Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS), as it represents a complex linguistic continuum comprising multiple closely related varieties.  This paper introduces a new corpus of heritage BCMS spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus aims to capture the speech patterns and language behaviors of second-generation speakers who have grown up in Switzerland but maintain a connection to their ancestral language and culture. These speakers offer valuable insights into how BCMS has evolved outside its original context and how it is used within diasporic communities.  The corpus consists of elicited conversations between 29 second-generation speakers, all originating from different regions of former Yugoslavia. The participants were asked to engage in various conversational tasks, including the map task, where they had to describe and discuss locations on a map. These conversations were recorded, transcribed, and turn-aligned to facilitate further analysis.  In total, the corpus contains 30 turn-aligned transcripts with an average length of 6 minutes each. The transcripts are enriched with extensive metadata about the speakers' background and socio-cultural context. Annotations such as part-of-speech tags, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis scores are also included to provide additional layers of linguistic information for researchers.  To facilitate access and analysis of the corpus data, we have developed an interactive corpus platform that allows users to browse, query, filter data based on different criteria such as speaker demographics or linguistic features. Users can also create custom annotations tailored to their research needs and share them with other users on the platform.  The principal user groups targeted by this corpus are researchers interested in studying heritage BCMS phenomena from various perspectives such as language contact, code-switching, language maintenance, or language attrition. Additionally, the corpus can serve as a valuable resource for students and teachers of BCMS living in diaspora communities who can use it for language learning and teaching purposes.  In addition to presenting the corpus platform and its functionalities, we also provide a case study focusing on BCMS spoken by a pair of siblings who participated in the map task. The analysis investigates their language behaviors, code-switching patterns, and linguistic strategies employed when describing locations on the map. This case study illustrates the rich potential of this corpus for uncovering unique features of heritage BCMS and sheds light on how it has adapted to life outside its traditional linguistic community.  While this corpus offers substantial benefits for researching heritage BCMS in Swiss context specifically, it also presents certain challenges. One major challenge is ensuring the representativeness of the sample, given that heritage speakers are a diverse group with varying degrees of proficiency and exposure to different varieties within BCMS. However, by including speakers from different regions of former Yugoslavia in our sample, we aim to capture some variation present within heritage BCMS.  Additionally, efforts are constantly being made to expand the size of this corpus by including more participants with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Moreover, ongoing collaborations with experts in sociolinguistics and dialectology will further enhance our understanding of how heritage languages evolve over time.  In conclusion, this paper introduces a new corpus that captures heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland. It provides an invaluable resource for researchers interested in studying various linguistic phenomena related to heritage languages. The interactive platform allows users to explore data easily while offering customization options tailored to individual research needs. Through ongoing expansion efforts and collaborations with experts across disciplines, we hope this corpus will contribute significantly towards advancing our knowledge about heritage languages like BCMS within diverse diaspora communities.

"The study of wordhood in languages has always been a topic of interest for linguists, as it provides insight into the structure and organization of those languages. In particular, the older Insular Celtic languages, such as Middle Welsh, have posed unique challenges due to their high amount of bound elements and complex phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures.  Previous research on these languages has suggested that individual words may play a lesser role in their grammars compared to other European languages. This is largely attributed to the extensive use of bound elements, which blur the boundaries between words and make it difficult to determine where one word ends and another begins. Additionally, the intricate phonological interactions further complicate the analysis of wordhood in these languages.  In this article, we aim to provide an in-depth investigation into the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. We draw upon typological research on wordhood as well as discuss the limitations and challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages.  The Middle Welsh verbal complex is known for its highly agglutinative nature, where multiple morphemes are affixed to roots or stems. These affixes serve various functions including tense/aspect/mood marking, subject agreement, object agreement, negation marking, among others. These affixes can be both prefixal or suffixal in nature and interact with each other phonologically.  One major challenge faced when studying wordhood is determining what constitutes a coherent unit within this complex verbal morphology. Is it composed solely of one root/stem plus its affixes? Or does it also include additional elements that might further modify or specify its meaning?  To address these questions, we examined various phenomena such as reduplication patterns (both partial and total), consonant mutations triggered by certain affixes or syntactic environments (known as lenition), vowel harmony effects across adjacent morphemes (known as umlaut), and the behavior of certain bound elements in different syntactic constructions.  Our findings reveal that structures resembling what can be traditionally labeled as 'words' do exist within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. However, these word-like units are highly dependent on context and do not align neatly with individual lexical items. Rather, they form a continuum of varying degrees of cohesiveness.  For example, some prefixes and suffixes consistently attach to specific stems, behaving like affixes in typical word-formation processes. They undergo phonological changes (such as lenition or umlaut) based on predictable patterns, indicating their close association with the root/stem and suggesting a level of morphological unity.  On the other hand, certain elements exhibit more flexibility in their attachment points and display phonological interactions that defy straightforward analysis. These elements often serve pragmatic or discourse-related functions rather than strictly morphological ones. Their behavior suggests a higher degree of syntactic or phrasal unity rather than strict wordhood.  Overall, our investigation provides evidence that the term 'word' is not very useful for synchronic description within Middle Welsh. While there are structures that resemble words to some extent, they exist along a continuum of cohesiveness and are heavily influenced by context.  This study highlights the importance of taking into account typological research on wordhood as well as recognizing the limitations inherent in studying corpus languages. It also opens avenues for further research into how these complex verbal complexes function syntactically and semantically within Middle Welsh grammar.  In conclusion, understanding the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in Middle Welsh verbs is crucial for comprehending its unique linguistic properties. The intricate interplay between bound elements and phonological interactions challenges traditional notions of wordhood and calls for innovative approaches to analyzing language structure in these complex systems.",continue
"The role of English as a global language has significantly impacted language education and motivation around the world. In multilingual countries like Switzerland, where multiple languages are commonly spoken, the influence of English on students' value beliefs in other languages has not been extensively explored. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal associations between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English, French, and German during their upper secondary school years. Additionally, it examines whether there are any differences in motivational development between multilingual and monolingual students.  Motivation plays a crucial role in language learning success, as it directly influences learners' effort and engagement with the target language. Previous research on language motivation has primarily focused on individual languages without considering potential interactions between them. By examining the interplay among value beliefs in multiple languages, this study provides valuable insights into how students' motivations might be influenced by their proficiency or interest in one specific language.  To analyze these longitudinal associations, data from 850 Swiss German students were collected annually from Grades 9 to 11 using self-report questionnaires. The participants had an average age of 15.61 years at the beginning of Grade 9 (SD = .62), with females constituting 54% of the sample. Multivariate latent growth modeling was utilized to examine changes over time regarding students' value beliefs in each language.  The results indicated a significant interference between students' value beliefs in English and their perceptions of French and German value over time. Students who initially reported higher value beliefs in English showed steeper decreases in their perceptions of value for French and German from Grades 9 to 11. However, those who experienced stronger increases in their English value beliefs also demonstrated stronger increases in their French and German values over time.  Furthermore, when comparing multilingual and monolingual students, it was found that while multilingual individuals initially reported higher value beliefs for both French and English compared to their monolingual peers, they exhibited steeper declines in value beliefs for these languages as they progressed through secondary school. This suggests that being proficient in multiple languages might not necessarily lead to sustained motivation or higher value beliefs.  These findings have important implications for language teaching practice and future research directions. First, educators need to be aware of the potential interference between English and other languages when designing language learning curricula. Acknowledging that students' motivations for one language can impact their motivation for others can help create more effective strategies for promoting sustained motivation across multiple languages.  Second, the decline in multilingual students' value beliefs over time highlights the need to identify strategies to maintain their motivations throughout their educational journey. Future research should investigate potential factors contributing to this decline and explore interventions or instructional approaches that can counteract it.  In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the longitudinal associations between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English, French, and German. It highlights the interference between English and other languages but also reveals the potential positive influence of increasing value beliefs in English on value beliefs in other languages. The differences observed between multilingual and monolingual students emphasize the importance of considering learners' linguistic backgrounds when developing motivational interventions. By better understanding these dynamics, educators can enhance language instruction practices and ultimately foster a more positive learning environment for multilingual learners.",continue
"Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, but it has received limited attention when it comes to its phonetic properties. In particular, research on the vowel quality variations in SSG influenced by Alemannic (ALM) dialects has been lacking. Most existing studies have focused primarily on consonants rather than vowels. To address this gap in research, this study aims to investigate the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties, specifically focusing on vowel quality.  The primary objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels. Secondly, it aims to determine the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities observed in SSG varieties.  To achieve these goals, a total of eight speakers (four males and four females) from four different regions were selected for recordings: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker was instructed to produce each vowel three times during recording sessions. This resulted in a corpus containing 1,632 tokens.  The analysis of the data revealed that there is a transfer of ALM vowel quality into the corresponding SSG varieties occurring predominantly in two dialect regions: Chur and Brig. In these regions, there was a significant resemblance between ALM vowels and those observed in their respective SSG varieties.  In contrast, some discrepancies were found between ALM vowels and those present in their corresponding Bern and Zurich SSG varieties. Notably, certain vowel qualities did not match entirely with their ALM counterparts – most notably with <a>, which was fronted in both Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties compared to ALM dialects' pronunciation.  Additional differences were observed when analyzing specific vowels within Bern's variety of SSG. For instance, <ä> was pronounced as both [ɛː] and [æː] in the Bern SSG variety, which deviated from standard ALM pronunciation. Furthermore, <o> was consistently realized with more backness in the Bern SSG variety compared to ALM dialects.  These findings suggest that interference from ALM dialects indeed plays a role in shaping vowel quality in their corresponding SSG varieties. However, it is evident that this influence is not uniform across all regions. While Chur and Brig showed high similarity between ALM and SSG vowels, the fronting of certain vowels observed in Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties indicates some divergence.  Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German influenced by Alemannic dialects. By analyzing vowel qualities within these dialect regions and their corresponding SSG varieties, it sheds light on both similarities and divergences between them. Further research is needed to explore other phonetic aspects of SSG as well as analyze the impact of different dialect regions on its phonetics comprehensively. 2. Methodology  To investigate the vowel qualities in four Alemannic dialects and their influence on the respective varieties of Swiss Standard German (SSG), a comparative acoustic analysis was conducted. Eight speakers, consisting of four males and four females, from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich were selected for recording sessions.  Each participant was instructed to produce each vowel three times in a controlled environment. The vowels recorded included /iː/, /uː/, /eː/, /oː/, /aː/, and /æː/. These vowels represent the long-vowel inventory commonly found in both Alemannic dialects and SSG.  The recordings resulted in a corpus comprising 1,632 tokens. Acoustic analysis software was utilized to measure various vowel properties such as formants frequencies (F1-F3), duration, and spectral characteristics.  3. Results  The results of the acoustic analysis revealed interesting findings regarding the vowel qualities observed in both ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.  In Chur and Brig – two regions with strong Alemannic influences – there was a remarkable similarity between ALM vowels' qualities compared to those found in their respective SSG varieties. The formant frequencies were closely aligned between these dialects, indicating a transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG.  However, some differences were observed when examining Bern's variety of SSG. One notable discrepancy involved <a>, which was fronted compared to its pronunciation in ALM dialects. This fronting effect suggests that while there is an influence from the underlying Alemannic phonetic system on Bern's variety of SSG, it is not entirely mirrored or copied.  A similar deviation from ALM vowels occurred within Zurich's variety of SSG as well. For instance, <ä> exhibited variations in pronunciation; it could be produced as either [ɛː] or [æː], veering from the standard ALM representation. Additionally, <o> was consistently pronounced with more backness in Zurich's SSG variety compared to its ALM counterparts.  4. Discussion  The results of this study provide valuable insights into the vowel quality variations within Alemannic dialects and their respective SSG varieties. The findings suggest that there is a significant transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG in some regions, such as Chur and Brig.  However, it is important to note that these dialectal influences on SSG are not uniform across all regions. The deviations observed in Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties indicate that other factors, such as regional linguistic features or sociolinguistic factors, may also contribute to the variation in vowel qualities.  It is essential for future research to explore these non-uniform influences further and investigate how regional differences impact the phonetic properties of SSG. Additionally, studying other phonetic aspects of SSG influenced by Alemannic dialects would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Swiss German phonetics.  In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of investigating vowel qualities in Alemannic dialects and their influence on Swiss Standard German varieties. By conducting an acoustic analysis comparing ALM vowels with corresponding SSG vowels, valuable insights into their similarities and divergences have been gained. Further research will help unveil additional aspects related to sound patterns and language change within Switzerland's multilingual context. ",continue
"Imitation plays a crucial role in language development, as it allows children to acquire and practice new linguistic and social skills. While previous research has extensively explored the relationship between imitation skills and language development in infants, limited attention has been given to the continued importance of these imitative behaviors later on in development. This correlational study aims to address this gap by investigating the joint relevance of multimodal imitation (incorporating gestures, prosody, and language) and object-based imitation on narratives and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers.  The ability to imitate multimodal cues is an important aspect of early language acquisition. Gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal utterances are all critical components of communication that preschoolers must learn to navigate effectively. By imitating these various modalities, children gain a deeper understanding of how to interpret social cues and develop their own communication skills.  To investigate the relationship between imitation skills and narrative abilities as well as sociopragmatic abilities, a sample of thirty-one typically developing 3-4-year-old children completed four tasks designed to assess their proficiency in multimodal imitation (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation (such as copying actions with objects), narrative abilities (through storytelling tasks), and sociopragmatic abilities (measured through tasks that assessed understanding of social conventions).  Analyzing the data revealed significant correlations between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities as well as sociopragmatic abilities. However, no significant correlation was found between object-based imitation skills alone with either narratives or sociopragmatics.  These findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues strongly predicts their performance in narrative tasks as well as their grasp of sociocommunicative conventions. It highlights the importance of incorporating not just verbal language but also non-verbal communicative elements into our understanding of language development.  By examining gesture use alongside spoken words and prosodic patterns, this study brings forth a more holistic perspective on imitation behaviors in language development. It recognizes that successful communication is a multi-faceted process that involves the integration of various modalities. Preschoolers who are adept at using gestures, intonation, and appropriate vocabulary are likely to be more competent storytellers and better equipped to navigate social interactions.  The implications of these findings extend beyond the theoretical framework of language development. They have practical implications for educators and clinicians working with preschool-aged children. By promoting the development of multimodal imitation skills, practitioners can help foster stronger narrative abilities and enhance sociopragmatic competence in young learners.  In conclusion, this correlational study provides evidence for the strong link between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills and their narrative as well as sociopragmatic abilities. It highlights the importance of considering gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns when examining imitation behaviors in the context of language development. By broadening our understanding of imitation to include multiple modalities, we gain insights into how children acquire language skills and navigate complex social interactions from an early age. 2. Methodology This study utilized a correlational design to examine the relationship between imitation skills and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. The sample consisted of thirty-one typically developing 3-4-year-old children, recruited from local preschools.  To assess the participants' imitation skills, two tasks were administered. The first task involved multimodal imitation, where children were asked to imitate a series of gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal utterances performed by an experimenter. The second task focused on object-based imitation, requiring participants to imitate various actions with objects presented by the experimenter.  Narrative abilities were evaluated through storytelling tasks that prompted children to create and narrate their own stories based on visual stimuli. The narratives were then rated for coherence, structure, grammar usage, and overall storytelling proficiency.  Sociopragmatic abilities were measured using tasks that tested understanding of social conventions and pragmatic language use in different contexts. This included scenarios where children had to interpret appropriate responses in social situations or identify false statements made between characters.  Statistical analyses were conducted to examine correlations between multimodal imitation skills (gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation skills (actions with objects), narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities.  3. Results The results of this study revealed significant correlations between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities (r = .56) as well as sociopragmatic abilities (r = .46). However, no significant correlation was found between object-based imitation skills alone with either narratives or sociopragmatics.  These results indicate that preschool-aged children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language development in terms of narratives as well as their understanding of social conventions when communicating with others.  4. Discussion  The findings from this study contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of multimodal imitation in preschool-aged children's language development. By incorporating gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal linguistic patterns into their imitative behaviors, children are better equipped to navigate the complexities of communication and develop stronger narrative and sociopragmatic skills.  The lack of correlation between object-based imitation skills and both narratives and sociopragmatics suggests that the ability to imitate actions with objects alone may not necessarily contribute to language development in the same way as incorporating multimodal cues does. This highlights the importance of considering a broader range of communicative elements when examining imitation behaviors in relation to language development.  Educators and clinicians working with young children can benefit from these findings by promoting the integration of gestures, prosody, and appropriate vocabulary into their teaching practices. By encouraging children to engage in multimodal imitation activities, practitioners can help enhance their narrative abilities as well as their understanding of socially appropriate communication.  However, it is important to note that this study focused solely on typically developing preschool-aged children. Future research could expand on these findings by including a more diverse sample that includes children with developmental delays or disorders. This would provide valuable insights into how imitation skills may vary across different populations and further inform intervention strategies for individuals who may struggle with language development.  In conclusion, this study emphasizes the significance of multimodal imitation skills for preschool-aged children's narrative abilities and sociopragmatic competence. The inclusion of gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns in imitation behaviors contributes to a broader conceptualization of language development. These findings have practical implications for educators and clinicians who aim to support young learners' communication skills through thoughtful incorporation of multimodal cues into instructional practices.

"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and as such, it has attracted considerable attention from researchers studying how it is framed in communication. Framing, a concept that refers to the way information is presented and interpreted, has become an important tool for understanding climate change communication. However, despite the proliferation of studies on this topic in recent years, there remains a lack of consensus on its definition and application.  In this systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap by examining trends in framing research on climate change and comparing them to broader trends in communication research. By doing so, we hope to shed light on how framing can be used as a bridging concept between different perspectives.  To conduct this review, we analyzed 25 years' worth of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change. In total, our sample included 275 articles that employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis. We focused our analysis on four key frame locations: frame production (i.e., who creates the frames), frame content (i.e., what messages are conveyed), audience frames (i.e., how frames are interpreted by different audiences), and framing effects (i.e., the impact of frames on attitudes and behaviors).  Our findings reveal several key insights about previous research on framing climate change. First, we observed that there has been limited utilization of framing's potential as a bridging concept. While individual studies have explored specific aspects of framing within their respective frame locations, few have examined how different locations interact with each other or seek to connect them theoretically.  This lack of integration between frame locations raises questions about the conceptual fit within existing literature. For example, if scholars focus solely on frame production without considering how these frames might be interpreted differently by various audiences or their ultimate impact (framing effects), they may miss important nuances in shaping public perceptions about climate change.  To address these concerns and move forward with future research directions in climate change communication, we propose several avenues for exploration. First, researchers should focus on developing a common language and understanding of framing to enhance synthesis across studies. This could involve clarifying definitions and taxonomies of frames and their locations.  Second, greater attention should be given to the interplay between frame locations. By examining how frame production influences frame content, how different audiences interpret frames, and the subsequent effects on attitudes and behaviors, researchers can provide a more comprehensive understanding of climate change communication.  Finally, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaboration in framing research. Climate change is a complex issue that requires input from various disciplines such as psychology, sociology, political science, and environmental studies. By bringing together scholars with diverse expertise, we can overcome disciplinary boundaries and develop a more holistic approach to studying framing in climate change communication.  In conclusion, our systematic review highlights the importance of framing as a bridging concept for understanding climate change communication. By analyzing trends in the field over the past 25 years and comparing them to broader communication research trends, we identify areas for improvement and recommend future directions for research. With continued efforts in this area, scholars can enhance our understanding of how frames shape public perceptions about climate change and contribute to effective communication strategies that address this urgent global issue.",continue
"Landscapes are an integral part of human life, providing both tangible and intangible benefits. They not only provide essential resources such as food and water but also offer aesthetic beauty, serenity, and recreational opportunities. The significance of landscapes is recognized globally, as evidenced by international conventions and treaties that aim to protect, monitor, and manage these valuable ecosystems.  Despite the importance of landscapes, there is still a lack of understanding regarding how people conceptualize them. Specifically, little is known about how individuals perceive and represent different components of landscapes. Recent research suggests that these conceptualizations can significantly impact landscape management practices. Consequently, it becomes crucial to investigate how people with different linguistic backgrounds and levels of expertise perceive various landscape domains.  In this study, we focused on exploring the conceptualizations of waterbodies—such as rivers, lakes or oceans—in both German-speaking individuals and English-speaking individuals who varied in their level of expertise in this domain. By comparing experts (those well-versed in waterbody-related terms) to nonexperts (individuals without specialized knowledge), we aimed to identify any differences in their conceptualization processes.  To carry out our investigation, we first identified commonly used waterbody terms used within sustainability discourses across both German and English languages. These terms acted as the basis for eliciting ratings related to sensory experiences (such as visual or auditory impressions), motor associations (activities associated with waterbodies), and affective responses (emotional associations).  Our findings revealed that speakers from both language groups generally exhibited similar ways of conceptualizing the domain of waterbody-related terms. This demonstrated a remarkable level of cross-cultural consistency in perceiving landscapes associated with water bodies.  However, we did observe subtle variations among nonexperts across different languages. For instance, there were notable differences between German-speaking nonexperts' association between specific types of waterbodies accompanied by calm happiness compared to English-speaking nonexperts' preferences for other waterbodies in relation to this emotional state. This suggests that language might influence or shape the emotional associations linked to certain landscape components.  Moreover, our research hinted at a potential role of olfaction in English speakers' conceptualization of waterbodies, an aspect that did not appear prominent among German speakers. Understanding these nuanced differences can shed light on how language and cultural contexts shape individuals' relationships with landscapes.  In conclusion, our study contributes to a growing body of research that aims to unravel the intricacies surrounding human conceptualizations of landscapes. By examining the specific domain of waterbodies within German and English language groups, we found both similarities and variations among experts and nonexperts. These findings reinforce the idea that shared perceptions of landscapes are influenced by individual backgrounds and highlight the need for further exploration into these linguistic-cultural influences on conceptualizing natural environments. Such insights can ultimately aid in developing more effective landscape management strategies that consider diverse perspectives and motivations across different communities. 2. Methodology  To investigate how language and expertise influence the conceptualization of waterbody-related terms, we employed a mixed-methods approach. First, we identified commonly used waterbody terms in sustainability discourses by conducting a comprehensive literature review in both German and English languages. This step ensured that our study encompassed a broad range of terms commonly employed to describe waterbodies.  Next, we recruited participants from both language groups who varied in their level of expertise in the domain of waterbodies. The expert group consisted of individuals with specialized knowledge and experience working with water-related issues, such as hydrologists or environmental scientists. The nonexpert group comprised individuals without specific expertise but were representative of the general population.  Participants were presented with a list of identified waterbody terms and asked to rate them on multiple dimensions: sensory (visual appearance, auditory characteristics), motor (associated activities or movements), and affective (emotions or feelings elicited). Ratings were collected using Likert scales ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated low intensity or relevance and 5 indicated high intensity or relevance.  Data analysis involved examining mean ratings across different dimensions for each term within each language group. We also performed statistical analyses to identify any significant differences between expert and nonexpert groups within each language group.  3. Results  Overall, our results revealed remarkable similarity in how speakers from both German and English language groups conceptualize landscape entities related to waterbodies. Experts across both languages consistently rated similar terms highly for sensory attributes such as natural beauty or calming sounds associated with flowing rivers.  Among nonexperts, while there was still significant agreement regarding certain sensory aspects across languages (such as visual appeal), subtle distinctions emerged concerning emotional associations with specific types of waterbodies. For example, English-speaking nonexperts tended to associate calm happiness more strongly with serene lakes compared to German-speaking nonexperts who expressed a preference for tranquil ponds.  Furthermore, an interesting finding was the potential influence of olfaction on English speakers' conceptualization of waterbodies. While specific terms elicited olfactory associations among nonexperts in the English group, this dimension appeared less prominent among their German counterparts.  4. Discussion  The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how language and expertise influence the conceptualization of landscape domains, particularly in relation to waterbodies. The striking similarities observed between experts suggest a shared understanding and perception fostered by specialized knowledge in both languages.  However, the subtle differences observed among nonexperts raise intriguing questions about the role language and culture play in shaping perceptions and emotional associations with landscapes. These variations may stem from cultural environmental experiences or linguistic nuances that impact individuals' relationships with specific types of waterbodies.  The potential influence of olfaction on English speakers' conceptualizations emphasizes the importance of considering multisensory aspects when examining landscape perception across different cultures and languages. Understanding these nuanced differences can inform strategies for effective communication about landscape management that consider diverse perspectives.  It is important to note some limitations associated with our study. The sample size for each language group should be expanded to ensure greater generalizability. Additionally, including participants from other cultures would provide a more comprehensive analysis of linguistic-cultural influences on conceptualizing landscapes.  Further research could delve deeper into understanding how language shapes not only perceptual but also cognitive processes related to landscapes. Examining how linguistic structures differ across languages in describing waterbody-related terms could offer insights into underlying cultural values or priorities concerning these landscapes.  5.Conclusion  In conclusion, this study highlights intriguing insights into how language and expertise shape individuals' conceptualizations of waterbody domains within German-speaking and English-speaking groups. While consistent patterns were observed among experts across cultures, subtle differences emerged among nonexpert groups regarding emotional associations and sensory dimensions linked to specific types of waterbodies.  These findings emphasize the need for holistic approaches when managing landscapes, considering the influence of linguistic-cultural factors in shaping individuals' relationships with nature. Future research should explore these issues across a wider range of cultures and languages to garner a more comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of landscape conceptualization. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform effective landscape management strategies that encompass diverse perspectives and promote sustainable interactions with our natural environment.",continue
"In interactive communication, language users often use referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs) to convey specific objects or people. These NP REs can undergo changes throughout a communicative interaction, as interlocutors tend to converge on linguistic forms and establish routine ways of referring [REF]. One notable change that occurs is the shortening of NP REs, making them more succinct and efficient [REF]. This chapter aims to investigate this process of shortening and analyze the structural changes that accompany it.  To study this phenomenon, a corpus of spoken English was collected through an experimental task where pairs of participants engaged in conversational interactions. They were tasked with repeatedly referring to visual stimuli as part of a referential communication task. The data obtained from these dialogues provide valuable insights into how interlocutors modify their NP REs over time.  The analysis reveals that interlocutors indeed shorten their NP REs throughout the elicited conversations. A closer examination demonstrates that there is a decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as the interaction progresses. Initially, speakers tend to include more elaborate clauses in their NP REs for added descriptive detail. However, as the conversation unfolds, they gradually reduce the presence of these clausal elements.  In contrast to the reduction in clausal modification, there is an observed increase in only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. Interlocutors prefer using simpler structures that require less syntactic complexity towards later stages of the conversation. This shift indicates a form of structural compression occurring within the shortened NP REs [REF].  These findings shed light on how speakers adapt their linguistic forms during interactive communication. As conversations progress and routines are established between interlocutors, there is a natural tendency towards brevity and efficiency in language use.  The observed patterns also have implications for our understanding of cognitive processes involved in reference production. Shortened NP REs with reduced clausal modification may reflect a cognitive economy principle, where interlocutors strive to convey information using the least effortful means possible. By simplifying their NP REs, speakers can optimize their cognitive resources and enhance communication efficiency.  Furthermore, the structural changes in NP REs over time demonstrate the dynamic nature of linguistic expression within interactive contexts. Language use is not a static phenomenon but evolves as speakers engage in ongoing interactions. These findings contribute to our understanding of how linguistic structures adapt and change during real-time communication.  In summary, this chapter analyzes the process of shortening in referring expressions with noun phrases at their center in interactive communication. The study reveals structural changes accompanying this shortening process, with a decrease in clausal modification and an increase in simpler phrasal forms. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of language use during communicative interactions and provide insights into cognitive processes involved in reference production. The findings of this study have important implications for various fields, including psycholinguistics, pragmatics, and communication studies. Understanding how referring expressions change over the course of an interaction can provide valuable insights into the underlying cognitive processes involved in language production and comprehension.  From a psycholinguistic perspective, this research contributes to our understanding of how speakers manage their cognitive load during communication. The tendency to shorten NP REs suggests that speakers adapt their language use to optimize processing resources. By reducing syntactic complexity and eliminating unnecessary elements, interlocutors can enhance information processing efficiency.  Pragmatically, these findings highlight the role of context in shaping referring expressions. As conversations progress and shared knowledge between interlocutors increases, there is less need for elaborate descriptions. Instead, shorter forms suffice as they rely on shared mental representations established throughout the interaction.  Moreover, these structural changes reflect an interactive process where both speakers actively shape and negotiate linguistic forms through mutual adaptation. As one speaker shortens their NP REs, it may prompt the other speaker to do the same in order to maintain conversational coherence and alignment.  Additionally, these results have practical implications for natural language processing (NLP) systems that aim to understand human-like communication patterns. Incorporating knowledge about the compression and structural changes in NP REs can help improve the accuracy of such systems by enabling them to generate more efficient referring expressions.  Future research could explore other factors influencing NP RE compression and investigate its role in different types of interactive communication tasks or genres. For instance, studying how referring expression shortening occurs within professional settings or across different languages could provide further insights into cross-contextual variation in linguistic adaptation strategies.  In conclusion, this chapter demonstrates that over the course of a communicative interaction between interlocutors using NP REs as referring expressions centred on noun phrases undergo compressions characterized by a decrease in clausal modification accompanied by an increase in simpler phrasal modifications. These structural changes reflect the dynamic nature of language use in interactive communication contexts, highlighting the cognitive processes involved in reference production and the importance of context in shaping linguistic expressions. By understanding how referring expression compression occurs, we can gain valuable insights into how speakers optimize their language use for efficient communication and develop more accurate models of natural language processing systems.",continue
"The Francoprovençal language, a non-standardized Gallo-Romance language, is at risk of extinction. As researchers in linguistics, our aim is to contribute to the preservation and understanding of this endangered language. In this paper, we explore the spatial distribution of partitive articles (PAs) and their potential correlates in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal.  Partitive articles are determiners that typically have an indefinite interpretation. They play an essential role in the syntactic structure and semantic interpretation of noun phrases. One potential correlate of PAs in Francoprovençal is the invariant form ""de"". Previous studies on Francoprovençal have reported a basic subdivision into two types: Francoprovençal A and B.  To investigate the distribution patterns of PAs and ""de"" more thoroughly, we conducted fieldwork data collection in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). Using this data, we created spatial maps to visualize their distribution across these regions.  Contrary to previous literature, our analysis reveals a more intricate spatial pattern for PAs and ""de"" in Francoprovençal. We found that the presence or absence of PAs is influenced by morphosyntactic factors. In Francoprovençal A, for instance, the occurrence of PAs depends on specific syntactic contexts.  In contrast, our findings demonstrate that in certain areas categorized as Francoprovençal B, singular and plural PAs do not co-occur. Instead, there are separate areas where only singular or only plural PAs are present. This indicates a more constrained pattern compared to previous research.  Interestingly, we discovered that there is no direct correlation between overt plural marking on nouns phonologically and the absence or presence of PAs. However, we did observe a correlation between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns (e.g., adding -s to indicate plural) and the absence of PAs. This suggests a potential influence of number marking on the presence or absence of PAs.  Our findings shed light on the distributional patterns of PAs and ""de"" in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal. By providing a more nuanced understanding, we contribute to the ongoing documentation and preservation efforts for this endangered language.  The spatial analysis presented in this paper enhances our knowledge not only about the specific features of Francoprovençal but also about Gallo-Romance languages more broadly. Understanding the distribution patterns of linguistic elements is crucial for describing, analyzing, and preserving endangered languages.  We hope that our research contributes to raising awareness about Francoprovençal's uniqueness as well as its vulnerability. By gaining a better understanding of this language, we can support future preservation efforts and foster appreciation for linguistic diversity in Switzerland and Italy. Additionally, our findings have implications for the study of language contact and language variation. The spatial distribution of PAs and ""de"" in Francoprovençal reflects the historical, cultural, and geographical factors that have shaped the language over time.  The presence of distinct patterns in Francoprovençal A and B suggests that these varieties may have different historical origins or influences from neighboring languages. Further research is needed to investigate these potential linguistic contact situations and their impact on the development of PAs in different regions.  Moreover, the correlation between sigmatic number marking on nouns and the absence of PAs raises intriguing questions about morphological processes in Francoprovençal. It suggests that there may be morphosyntactic interactions between noun morphology and determiners. Investigating these interactions can provide insight into how grammatical features evolve within a language over time.  Our study also highlights the importance of fieldwork data collection for accurately documenting endangered languages like Francoprovençal. By engaging with speakers in their native environments, we were able to capture detailed information about linguistic phenomena that may not be captured through other methods such as historical texts or recordings alone.  In conclusion, our spatial analysis reveals a more complex distribution pattern for partitive articles (PAs) and their potential correlates (such as ""de"") in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal than previously reported. This nuanced understanding enhances our knowledge about this endangered Gallo-Romance language while also contributing to broader discussions on language variation, contact situations, morphosyntax, and preservation efforts.  Moving forward, it is crucial to continue documenting endangered languages like Francoprovençal before they vanish completely. Alongside documentation efforts, further research can delve deeper into understanding the sociolinguistic factors influencing variations in PAs across different regions.  By shedding light on the unique features of this marginalized dialect group within Switzerland and Italy's linguistic landscape, we hope to inspire increased recognition and appreciation for the rich linguistic diversity that characterizes the Francoprovençal language. Ultimately, our research aims to contribute to its preservation and ensure that future generations have access to this invaluable cultural heritage.",continue
"1. Introduction  The role of working memory (WM) in serial recall tasks has been a topic of keen interest in cognitive psychology, specifically with regard to how phonological and semantic information are encoded and represented differently. Numerous studies have shown that the performance in immediate serial recall tasks is significantly affected by phonological similarity, whereby participants are more likely to make errors when recalling word lists containing phonologically similar items (e.g., cat, fat, mat). This phenomenon, known as the phonological-similarity effect, underscores the critical role played by phonology in the representation of serial order within WM tasks.  Interestingly, while the impact of phonological similarity on performance is well-established, previous research has demonstrated that semantic similarity does not exert a similar negative influence on recall accuracy. Discrepancies between these findings raise intriguing questions about how positional information is retained within WM and how it may be differentially impacted by phonological and semantic factors.  To address this discrepancy and gain a deeper understanding of how WM encoding varies across different types of information processing, this study aims to investigate the effects of both phonological and semantic similarity on retaining positional information within WM. By examining both types of similarities within a single experimental paradigm involving young adult participants across multiple experiments (all Ns = 60), we aim to provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying these encoding processes.  Building upon previous research examining item-context bindings in WM retrieval tasks using various paradigms (e.g., Murray et al., 2015; Morey et al., 2017), our study focuses on testing the effects of manipulated between-item similarities with respect to both semantics an d phonology. Specifically, participants will be required to form and maintain new item-context bindings in WM while manipulating semantic and phonological similarity between the items.  The overarching goal of this study is to shed light on how WM processes differ in encoding and retaining information that is phonologically similar versus semantically similar. Understanding these differences can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of WM functioning, as well as inform theories regarding the organization and storage of different types of information within memory systems.  The current literature on WM has primarily focused on the role of phonological processing in serial recall tasks, overlooking potential contributions from semantic processing. By examining both types of similarities within a single experimental design, this study aims to extend our understanding beyond the traditional emphasis on phonology towards a more comprehensive view that encompasses semantic factors.  Based on previous research findings indicating that semantic similarity does not hinder performance in immediate serial recall tasks (e.g., Gathercole et al., 2008; Acheson et al., 2011), we hypothesize that our results will replicate these findings. We predict that participants' recall accuracy for item-context bindings will not be significantly affected by manipulated levels of semantic similarity between items during retrieval tasks.  Contrastingly, given consistent evidence suggesting a robust negative impact of phonological similarity on immediate serial recall (Baddeley et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2005), we expect to observe impairments in participant's ability to accurately retain item-context bindings when faced with high levels of phonological similarity amongst items.  Furthermore, exploring whether or not there are interactive effects between semantics and phonology is an important objective. Specifically, it remains unclear whether changes in one type of similarity (e.g., increasing or decreasing semantic similarities) can influence how another type (e.g., phonological similarities) affects performance in retaining positional information within WM. Therefore, an additional aim is to explore potential interactions between these two factors.  In summary, this study aims to elucidate the differential encoding mechanisms of phonological and semantic information within WM. By investigating how manipulated levels of semantic and phonological similarity impact participants' ability to retain item-context bindings in various retrieval tasks, we hope to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how different types of information are processed and represented within WM. Furthermore, our findings may inform theoretical frameworks regarding the organization and storage of diverse information in memory systems, thus advancing our knowledge about cognitive processes related to working memory functioning.",create
"Title: The Influence of Language Contact on Heritage BCMS Spoken in German-speaking Switzerland  1. Introduction  The study of heritage languages, especially those spoken by second-generation speakers living in diaspora, plays a vital role in understanding language maintenance and the effects of language contact. This paper presents an exploration into the increasing linguistic diversity in German-speaking Switzerland through an investigation into the Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS) spoken by the second-generation diaspora.  The phenomenon of language shift is a complex process influenced by various factors such as societal attitudes towards heritage languages, proficiency level of speakers, exposure to dominant languages, and intergenerational transmission patterns. As countries experience immigration and globalization trends, it becomes crucial to examine how these sociolinguistic dynamics affect the preservation or loss of heritage languages.  German-speaking Switzerland is home to a significant number of individuals whose families originate from different regions across former Yugoslavia. The descendants of these migrants often find themselves negotiating multiple linguistic identities while navigating both their ancestral culture and integration into Swiss society. In this context, BCMS serves as an example for examining how language contact influences intergenerational language practices within diverse diasporic communities.  To investigate this phenomenon comprehensively, we present a novel corpus specifically designed for studying heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus comprises elicited conversations involving 29 individuals who represent various regions within former Yugoslavia. Each participant engages in dialogue with native-like fluency for approximately 6 minutes on average.  In addition to facilitating access to primary data sources through transcriptions and metadata details related to participants' backgrounds, our corpus offers pre-calculated counts and annotations that enhance visibility over diverse linguistic features embedded within these conversations. Moreover, it provides an interactive platform with browsing capabilities that enable easy navigation through the dataset while supporting diverse query operations such as filtering based on specific linguistic variables or participant characteristics.  This research initiative addresses various user groups, including heritage BCMS researchers, students studying or teaching BCMS in diaspora contexts, as well as individuals interested in the sociolinguistic intricacies of language contact. By providing an extensive corpus resource, we aim to support empirical investigations and linguistic inquiries related to heritage BCMS spoken within the German-speaking Swiss context.  Furthermore, this paper presents a case study centered on a pair of siblings who participated in a map task within our corpus platform. This case study exemplifies both the advantages and challenges encountered when utilizing such a rich digital corpus for linguistic research. By analyzing the performance of these participants during a map task conversation conducted entirely in BCMS, we shed light on language contact phenomena and the role of intergenerational transmission among second-generation speakers.  Through this exploration into heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers living in German-speaking Switzerland, our paper contributes to expanding knowledge related to language maintenance and language shift processes within diasporic communities. The comprehensive corpus resource presented here provides an essential tool for future investigations that seek to understand how immigrant languages evolve under varying degrees of societal pressure and multilingual environments. 2. Significance and Objectives  The study of heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland holds significant importance for several reasons. Firstly, the linguistic landscape of Swiss society has become increasingly diverse due to global migration patterns and the subsequent establishment of diasporic communities. This linguistic diversity necessitates a deeper understanding of language contact phenomena and its impact on heritage language maintenance.  Secondly, investigating the intergenerational transmission of BCMS among second-generation speakers provides insights into how language shift processes unfold within the diaspora context. Understanding the factors that contribute to language maintenance or loss is not only crucial for these diasporic communities but also for policymakers and educators who seek to create inclusive environments that support multilingualism.  By constructing a corpus specifically dedicated to heritage BCMS in German-speaking Switzerland, this research aims to achieve several objectives. Firstly, it seeks to facilitate empirical investigations into various aspects of heritage language acquisition and use among second-generation speakers. The comprehensive transcripts, enriched with metadata and annotations related to socio-linguistic variables, offer a wealth of data for researchers interested in studying dialectal variation, code-switching patterns, phonetic features, or pragmatic characteristics embedded within these conversations.  Additionally, this corpus serves as an invaluable resource for students and teachers engaged with teaching BCMS within diaspora contexts. By providing access to real-life conversations captured in naturalistic settings, educators can supplement their instruction with authentic materials that reflect the unique linguistic situation faced by their students.  Moreover, through our interactive corpus platform's browsing capabilities and custom annotation features we hope researchers will benefit from a user-friendly tool that supports advanced search operations while allowing collaborations through shared annotations.  To illustrate these advantages fully—while acknowledging potential challenges—we present a case study focused on two siblings who participated in our map task conversation within the corpus platform. This examination allows us to explore how different sociolinguistic variables influence sibling speech patterns during collaborative tasks conducted entirely in BCMS. By investigating their language use, code-switching tendencies, and lexical choices, we can gain insights into the interplay between heritage language maintenance and exposure to the dominant languages in a multilingual environment.  Overall, this paper contributes to the existing research on heritage languages by adding a unique perspective of linguistic contact within German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus resource presented here serves as an essential tool for investigating the complex dynamics associated with sustaining heritage BCMS in diasporic communities. By shedding light on language practices among second-generation speakers and providing empirical evidence related to intergenerational transmission, we aim to contribute to scholarship in sociolinguistics and language maintenance while supporting educational endeavors in teaching heritage BCMS within a diaspora context.  In the following sections of this paper, we will provide detailed descriptions of corpus construction methodologies, metadata specifications for participant profiles, annotation procedures implemented throughout the dataset creation process, and how researchers can access and utilize this invaluable resource for their linguistic inquiries. Finally, we will analyze our case study results concerning sibling speech patterns during a map task conversation in order to further evaluate their implications regarding language contact phenomena among second-generation speakers living in German-speaking Switzerland.",create
"1. Introduction  The Middle Welsh verb has long been a subject of scrutiny among philologists and linguists, particularly in its phonological and morphological distribution. Existing research suggests that there is a significant presence of bound elements in the older Insular Celtic languages, which brings into question the role of individual words within their grammars. Moreover, the intricate array of phonological interactions observed within the morphological and phrasal structures of these languages adds another layer to this complex issue.  While numerous studies have explored the concept of wordhood across various European languages, few have examined it within the specific context of Middle Welsh. Furthermore, previous investigations often face methodological challenges when dealing with corpus languages. Therefore, there remains a need for an in-depth investigation into the structure and boundaries defining word-like domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex.  This paper aims to address this research gap by offering a detailed examination of both morphological and phonological aspects associated with wordhood in Middle Welsh verbs. Drawing on insights from current typological research on wordhood as well as engaging in critical discussions regarding methodological limitations encountered while studying corpus languages, we will present an extensive analysis that sheds light on this intriguing linguistic phenomenon.  The overarching question driving this study can be framed as follows: What are the discernible morpho-phonological domains that resemble words within the Middle Welsh verbal complex? By exploring this question, we hope to gain further insights into not only how words function or are delimited but also whether traditional notions surrounding ""word"" adequately capture language-specific phenomena such as that found in Middle Welsh.  To achieve our objectives, we will employ a comprehensive methodology involving close examination and annotation of existing texts written during the period when Middle Welsh was spoken (12th to 14th century). These texts offer invaluable sources for uncovering patterns related to word-like structures within verbs. Additionally, our analysis will heavily rely on linguistic theories pertaining to morphology and phonology to ensure a robust and principled investigation.  The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of previous research on wordhood, highlighting key findings and methodological challenges. In Section 3, we outline the specific characteristics of the Middle Welsh verbal complex that warrant closer examination regarding word-like domains. Section 4 details our methodology, including the selection criteria for texts as well as a description of our annotation approach. The results of our analysis are presented in Section 5, followed by a discussion (Section 6) that reflects upon the implications of these findings for understanding wordhood in Middle Welsh. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for future research directions in this fascinating area (Section 7).  In conclusion, this study seeks to contribute to our understanding of how words are conceptualized within Middle Welsh verbs by offering a comprehensive investigation into their morphological and phonological distribution. By highlighting potential word-like structures through meticulous analysis and considering methodological limitations encountered when studying corpus languages, we hope to enrich linguistic scholarship on ancient languages while also reconsidering traditional notions surrounding ""word"" within synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh.",create
"1. Introduction  The field of language motivation research has predominantly focused on examining various factors that influence students' motivation in the process of language learning. Several studies have investigated the role of student characteristics, instructional practices, and societal factors in shaping students' motivation towards learning a second or foreign language (Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2013; Gardner, 2010). However, one area that has been largely neglected within this field is the exploration of motivational interactions during multiple language learning.  In multilingual contexts such as Switzerland, where English, German, and French are commonly spoken languages with different levels of proficiency among students (Berthele & Gretler Heusser, 2017), understanding how value beliefs in different languages interact over time becomes crucial for educators and policymakers alike. Value beliefs refer to personal judgments regarding the importance or usefulness individuals attribute to a particular activity or goal (Eccles et al., 1983; Ziopoulou & Nikitina-Tsokouli, 2020). Exploring longitudinal associations between students' value beliefs in multiple languages can offer valuable insights into possible interferences or facilitative effects among these linguistic domains.  The present study aims to address this research gap by investigating the longitudinal relations between Swiss German-speaking secondary school students' value beliefs in English, French, and German. We seek to explore whether there are differences in motivational development between multilingual students who have exposure to three languages compared to their monolingual peers.  1.1 Research Questions  This study focuses on addressing two main research questions:  1) Are there any longitudinal associations between Swiss German-speaking secondary school students' value beliefs in English and their value beliefs for French and German? 2) Do multilingual students differ from monolingual students regarding their motivational development across all three languages?  To examine these questions empirically and account for potential covariates such as gender and age variations among participants, multivariate latent growth modeling will be employed. This analytical approach allows us to examine how interrelated changes in value beliefs occur across different languages and to compare the developmental trajectories of multilingual and monolingual students over time.  1.2 Significance of the Study  Understanding how value beliefs interact within a multilingual context has important implications for language education policies and instructional practices. By gaining insights into the longitudinal associations between students' value beliefs in English, French, and German, we can inform educators about potential interferences or facilitative effects that may occur when learning multiple languages simultaneously.  Additionally, investigating differences in motivational development between multilingual and monolingual students can shed light on whether individuals with exposure to multiple languages exhibit distinct patterns of motivation compared to those who are proficient in only one language. Such insights hold practical relevance for teachers who encounter diverse student populations with varying language backgrounds.  Moreover, this study contributes to the broader field of language motivation research by addressing a significant gap in understanding motivational interactions during multiple language learning. The findings from this study will expand our knowledge about how students' motivation unfolds across different linguistic domains, thereby advancing theoretical understandings of the complexities involved in language learning processes.  Overall, this paper seeks to provide an empirical examination of longitudinal associations between value beliefs in English, French, and German among Swiss German-speaking secondary school students while considering potential differences between multilingual and monolingual student groups. By doing so, we aim to offer insights that can inform educators' instructional practices as well as stimulate further research exploring motivational aspects within a multilingual educational landscape.",create
"Introduction  The study of vowel quality in dialects and their impact on the respective standardized varieties is an important area of research in sociolinguistics and phonetics. While there has been significant attention given to consonant properties in various dialects, the exploration of vowel quality in relation to its influence on standardized varieties remains relatively understudied. This gap motivates an investigation into the acoustic analysis of vowel inventories, with a particular focus on their transfer from dialects to standardized languages.  In Switzerland, Swiss Standard German (SSG) holds official status, making it a particularly interesting case for examining the impact of Alemannic (ALM) dialects on the vowel qualities within SSG varieties. The ALM dialect region encompasses diverse areas such as Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Prior studies have primarily concentrated on consonantal distinctions within these ALM dialects rather than vowels.  To address this research gap and provide valuable insights into the dynamics between ALM vowels and their corresponding SSG counterparts, this study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of long-vowel inventories in four ALM dialects alongside their respective SSG forms. By examining both male and female speakers from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich through acoustic recordings capturing each vowel produced three times per speaker, we can develop a comprehensive corpus comprising 1,632 tokens.  The primary objective of this study is two-fold: first, it seeks to establish an initial comparative acoustic analysis focusing specifically upon long-vowel qualities found within both ALM and SSG speech; secondly; it examines how significantly interference from ALM dialects shapes vowel qualities present within different SSG varieties.  Through our investigation into these aspects of vowel quality transfer between ALM dialect regions and corresponding SSG forms spoken across various Swiss cities will contribute not only towards our understanding of linguistic variation but also help us discern patterns that potentially contribute to language change dynamics.  The results obtained from this study will shed light on the extent to which ALM vowel qualities are transferred to SSG varieties across different dialect regions. Initial findings indicate a significant effect of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities present in Chur and Brig SSG varieties. However, discrepancies emerge when analyzing SSG vowels spoken in Bern and Zurich, with noticeable differences observed particularly for the fronting of <a> sounds not matching those found in ALM varieties.  Additionally, our investigation reveals that the Bern SSG variety produces <ä> as both [ɛː] and [æː], while <o> is pronounced with a greater emphasis on back articulation.  The research conducted here aims to provide valuable insights into the phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German through an exploration of vowel quality influenced by Alemannic dialects. By addressing this gap within current academic literature, we contribute to strengthening our understanding of linguistic variation, language change dynamics, and further knowledge surrounding Swiss multilingualism.  In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive investigation into long-vowel inventories within four ALM dialect regions alongside their corresponding SSG forms. The examination includes male and female participants from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich using both acoustic analysis techniques along with an extensive corpus comprising 1,632 tokens. Through our study's two-fold objectives—namely providing a comparative acoustic analysis while exploring interference effects from ALM varieties—we aim to deepen our understanding of vowel transfer dynamics between dialects and standardized languages present in Switzerland. Ultimately contributing towards ongoing discourse surrounding linguistic variation research as well as providing valuable insights into Swiss multilingualism dynamics at play within spoken language communities across various Swiss cities like Bern, Chur, Brig,and Zurich.

"1. Introduction  The study of imitation behaviors in early childhood has long been a topic of interest for researchers in the field of language development. Previous studies have shown that infants' early imitation skills, such as object- and language-based imitation, play a crucial role in their language acquisition process (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Rochat et al., 1998). However, there remains a dearth of research examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors as children progress through development.  This paper seeks to address this research gap by investigating the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic skills in preschool-aged children. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate gestural, prosodic, and lexical components simultaneously (Dickerson Mayes et al., 2015). Previous studies have primarily focused on object-based imitation without considering its connection to other modes of communication. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of children's development in these areas, it is essential to investigate how different modes of imitation relate to their narrative and sociopragmatic abilities.  Narrative abilities are integral to language development as they allow individuals to construct cohesive stories by organizing thoughts and events into meaningful sequences (Boudreau & Hedberg, 2014). Preschoolers who possess strong narrative skills are better able to express themselves verbally and comprehend complex linguistic structures (Hudson et al., 2013). Sociopragmatic abilities encompass understanding social cues embedded within communicative encounters (Paul & Norbury, 2012). This includes recognizing appropriate turn-taking during conversations or adjusting one's speech register based on the listener's needs. Developing effective sociopragmatic skills is crucial for successful social interaction.  The current study aims to determine whether preschool-aged children who exhibit strong multimodal imitation skills also possess enhanced narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining these relationships concurrently within the same cohort, we can elucidate the link between imitation behaviors and broader language and sociocommunicative skills.  Understanding the connection between multimodal imitation and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities has important implications for early intervention strategies aimed at promoting language development. If we can identify specific imitation behaviors that are strongly associated with narrative and sociopragmatic skills, interventions can be specifically tailored to target these areas. This, in turn, may lead to more efficient interventions that better support children's overall language growth.  In light of this background, the present study will utilize a correlational design to examine the relationship between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. By assessing these various aspects within a single study cohort using standardized tasks carefully designed for each construct of interest, we aim to provide valuable insights into the relationship between imitation behaviors and preschoolers' language development.  In conclusion, while previous research has emphasized the importance of early imitation skills for language development in infants, little is known about how different modes of imitation relate to narrative and sociopragmatic abilities as children grow older. The current study seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining whether preschool-aged children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is linked with their language competencies. Such findings will contribute towards a broader conceptualization of imitative behaviors in the field of language development that integrates various modalities including prosody, gesture use, and verbal linguistic patterns.

"1. Introduction  The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident and urgent, prompting scholars from various disciplines to explore effective ways of communicating this complex issue to diverse audiences. While significant research has been conducted on the topic of framing in climate change communication, a lack of clear definitions and conceptual clarity hampers the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This study aims to address this gap by examining the role of framing as a bridging concept for climate change communication.  Framing refers to the way in which information is presented, emphasizing certain aspects while downplaying or omitting others, thereby influencing how individuals perceive and interpret an issue. In recent years, framing has gained prominence as a means to understand public attitudes towards climate change and shape communication strategies that can mobilize action at individual, community, and policy levels.  However, despite growing interest in framing as it relates to climate change communication, its potential as a bridging concept remains largely untapped. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring how different frame locations within the broader context of cultural framing (i.e., frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects) can serve as potential bridges between disparate perspectives.  Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative approaches through extensive content analysis spanning 25 years' worth (n = 275) of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change research will guide our investigations. By systematically reviewing existing literature on both general communication research trends overall compared with those specific to climate change discourse,y we aimdemonstratehow framewsto can be utilizede bridge across divergent viewpoints an facilitate effective science-so society interactions.

"1. Introduction  Waterbodies are integral components of landscapes, serving both ecological and socio-cultural functions. They support diverse ecosystems, provide essential resources such as water and sustenance, and hold significant recreational and aesthetic values for human societies worldwide. The understanding of how people conceptualize waterbodies is critical in managing and conserving these vital landscape features effectively. However, despite their importance, there remains a paucity of research on the role of native language and expertise in shaping individuals' representations of waterbody-related terms.  While studies have investigated the conceptualization of various landscape entities, such as forests or mountains (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson & Brown, 2019), little attention has been given to exploring how people from different linguistic backgrounds engage with and interpret specific domains within the broader concept of landscape—most notably waterbodies. Understanding how individuals with varying levels of expertise perceive these areas offers valuable insights into the underlying cognitive processes associated with linguistic categorization.  Consequently, this study seeks to unravel differences in the conceptualization of waterbody-related terms between English-speaking experts, nonexperts who use English as their native language (ENL speakers), German-speaking experts (GSE speakers), and German nonexperts whose mother tongue is German (GNL speakers). By comparing these groups across languages and levels of expertise, we aim to shed light on potential variations in language-specific perceptions within this domain.  The interplay between language diversity and cultural influence on cognition has long fascinated researchers across disciplines ranging from psychology to anthropology (Boroditsky & Gaby 2010; Mesoudi et al., 2006). Language provides a framework through which individuals interact with their environment by encoding concepts that shape our understanding and interpretation thereof (Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis). Given that different languages possess distinct linguistic structures for categorizing objects or situations involving landscapes or natural elements (e.g., How do language speakers categorize the notion of ""flowing water""?), it is reasonable to hypothesize that such variations might manifest in the conceptualization of waterbodies.  Moreover, expertise has been shown to influence individuals' mental representations and perceptions of specific domains (Ericsson et al., 2018). Experts exhibit heightened perceptual sensitivity, as well as a propensity for generating more elaborate and nuanced representations, compared to novices (Hodder & Malik, 2021; Bilalic et al., 2009). Therefore, it is crucial to explore how expertise influences the perception and conceptualization of waterbodies within and across linguistic contexts.  Building upon previous research investigating landscape entities through language (e.g., Smith et al., 2018; Johnson & Brown, 2019), this study employs a comparative analysis to examine how differences in native language and expertise impact the conceptualization of waterbodies. Specifically, we investigate whether individuals' associations with waterbody-related terms vary based on their native language or level of expertise. We employ a range of sensory, motor, and affective measures to capture participants' subjective experiences with different types of waterbodies across languages.  Ultimately, this investigation aims to contribute valuable insights into how people from diverse linguistic backgrounds perceive landscapes through the lens of specific domain-specific terms related to waterbodies. Understanding these perceptual dynamics can inform future landscape management strategies by accounting for potential variation in cultural or linguistic perspectives when developing policies targeting conservation efforts or land-use planning.  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview on relevant theoretical perspectives highlighting the importance of language and expertise in shaping our understanding landscapes. Section 3 outlines our methodology detailing participant recruitment procedures, data collection methods employed during our experiments with sensory ratings alongside affective evaluations. Section 4 presents our findings comparing English-speaking experts/nonexperts with German-speaking experts/nonexperts within each group for insights into potential language-specific influences. Lastly, Section 5 concludes the paper by discussing the implications of our results for landscape management and suggests avenues for further research in this domain.",create
"1. Introduction  The use of referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs) is a fundamental aspect of interactive communication. Language users frequently employ NP REs to refer to objects, entities or concepts during communicative interactions, thereby facilitating the comprehension and coherence of the conversation. Previous research has established that interlocutors tend to converge on linguistic forms and establish routines over the course of an interaction (REF). This process is further characterized by a notable pattern: the tendency for speakers to shorten their NP REs as the discourse unfolds (REF).  While previous studies have focused on the phenomenon of shortening in NP REs, a question arises regarding how this process impacts the structure and composition of these referring expressions. This paper aims to explore this underinvestigated area by examining structural changes that accompany the shortening process in NP REs.  To investigate this research question, an experiment was conducted using an elicited corpus consisting of spoken English conversations between participants engaged in referential communication tasks. Participants were grouped into conversational dyads and instructed to repeatedly reference visual stimuli provided during the task. The data collected from these interactions serve as valuable insights into how interlocutors modify their NP REs as they engage in conversation.  The results reveal intriguing patterns concerning structural changes in NP REs over time within interlocutors' communicative dialogues. It becomes apparent that interlocutors tend to consistently shorten their NP REs throughout these interactions – particularly by decreasing longer clausal post-head elements – while showing relative increases in both premodified and shorter phrasal postmodification structures.  These observed changes present compelling evidence suggesting shifts occur not only in speech style but also within structural modification patterns employed within interacting parties' NPRE usage throughout a conversation. Initially, speakers tend to produce more clausal elements, which are associated with greater structural elaboration for increased emphasis or clarification purposes. However, as dialogues progress, there is a noticeable decline in the use of such clausal elements, seemingly indicating a movement towards more concise and compressed structural modifications.  Understanding these trends in structural changes within NP REs contributes to our broader understanding of how language users adapt their linguistic forms during real-time communicative interactions. Notably, it sheds light on the dynamic nature of interactive communication and highlights the importance of considering both form and function within this process.  In conclusion, this paper aims to delve into an unexplored aspect surrounding linguistic adaptations in interactive communication. By examining shifts within NP REs' structure over time, we gain insight into interlocutors' modification patterns, specifically how they compress their referring expressions. The findings provide valuable contributions to existing research on referential communication by deepening our understanding of the mechanisms behind shortening processes in NP REs. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of distinguishing different types of structural modifications employed by speakers as they navigate conversational dynamics. Further elucidating the structural changes observed in NP REs contributes to our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying referential communication and how interlocutors adapt their language use. By examining how speakers progressively modify their NP REs, we gain valuable insights into the strategies employed to optimize message transmission and comprehension.  The relevance of this research lies in its potential implications for fields such as natural language processing and computational linguistics. The findings could inform the development of algorithms and models that better mimic human-like referring expressions in artificial intelligence systems. Additionally, understanding these structural changes can enhance automatic reference resolution systems by providing insights into patterns that facilitate accurate identification of the intended referent.  At a broader level, this investigation contributes to linguistic theory by shedding light on how communicative constraints shape language use. The process of shortening NP REs can be viewed as not only an efficiency-driven adaptation but also a manifestation of social alignment dynamics between participants engaged in conversation. As individuals engage in interactive discourse, there is a natural tendency to converge on linguistic forms, establishing shared routines that enhance mutual understanding (REF). This study adds nuance to our knowledge by uncovering both surface-level (shortening) and structural modifications within NP REs that occur during interactive communication.  To conduct this investigation comprehensively, we employ an experimentally elicited corpus consisting of spoken English dialogues involving conversational dyads engaging in a referential communication task. This approach allows us to observe real-time interactions closely while ensuring controlled conditions for accurate analysis and interpretation.  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of related literature surrounding referential communication, focusing particularly on shorter-form referring expressions such as pronouns or abbreviated noun phrases. Section 3 details our experimental design methodology, including participant selection criteria, task instructions, data collection procedures, and transcription conventions followed during analysis.  Section 4 presents our findings regarding the structural changes observed within NP REs over time. We examine patterns of shortening and categorize modifications based on the type of structural elaboration involved. Additionally, we analyze potential factors that may influence these changes, such as cognitive load or discourse context.  Section 5 provides a theoretical discussion and interpretation of the observed results. We discuss how these findings align with existing frameworks concerning referential communication and language production, highlighting their implications for our understanding of language adaptation processes in interactive settings.  Finally, in Section 6, we conclude by summarizing our key findings and their broader implications for linguistic theory as well as practical applications in computational linguistics and natural language processing.  In essence, this paper presents a novel exploration into the structural changes that occur within NP REs during interactive communication. The insights gained not only deepen our understanding of linguistic adaptations but also offer important contributions to various fields relying on effective referential communication mechanisms. By dissecting the dynamics underlying shortening processes within NP REs, this research opens avenues for future investigation while broadening our knowledge about how individuals modify their speech to optimize message transmission within conversational contexts.",create
"1. Introduction  One of the central questions in linguistic research is understanding the complex nature of determiners and their potential correlates in various language varieties. This paper aims to explore this question by examining the spatial distribution of partitive articles (PAs) and an accompanying correlate, invariable de, within Francoprovençal, an endangered Gallo-Romance language.  Gallo-Romance languages are a subgroup within the larger Romance language family that emerged from Vulgar Latin spoken during the Roman Empire. Francoprovençal, a non-standardized variety of Gallo-Romance, faces high endangerment due to various socio-cultural factors (REF). The study focuses on Swiss and Italian varieties spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy), respectively.  PAs are determiners that typically have an indefinite interpretation. In this investigation, we seek to shed light on their distribution patterns within Francoprovençal as well as their relationship with the invariable de construct. Previous studies have reported a basic subdivision of Francoprovençal into two types: Francoprovençal A and B (REF). However, our analysis aims to provide a more nuanced picture by considering morphosyntactic features of PAs.  The primary objective is to map out the spatial distribution patterns of PAs and de within different regions inhabited by speakers from these language varieties. Given that PAs are known to exhibit varying presence depending on syntactic context in some areas while being limited predominantly to specific regions in others (REF), it is essential to delve deeper into these distinctions for both theoretical understanding and practical documentation purposes.  Another point of investigation concerns potential correlations between phonological plural marking on nouns and absence or presence of PAs, as well as any connections between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns while considering PAs' occurrence or absence.  To accomplish our research goals effectively, we engage with fieldwork data collected from Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). By presenting multiple maps of these areas, we aim to identify any spatial patterns that have not been previously reported in the literature.  Through our findings, we hope to contribute valuable insights into the distributional properties of PAs and de in Francoprovençal. This research not only enriches our understanding of this endangered language but also has broader implications for linguistic typology, providing novel perspectives on determiner systems within Gallo-Romance varieties.  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of previous research related to PAs and their correlates. Section 3 outlines the methodology employed in this study, including data collection procedures and mapping techniques utilized. Section 4 presents our findings, analyzing the spatial distribution patterns of PAs and de across different regions within Francoprovençal. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our results for theoretical linguistics and suggests potential areas for further research.  Overall, this study expands upon existing scholarship by delivering a comprehensive analysis of partitive articles' distribution in Francoprovençal varieties spoken across Switzerland and Italy. The insights gained from this investigation can inform language documentation efforts as well as contribute to broader theoretical discussions within linguistic typology. 2. Previous Research  Previous research on partitive articles (PAs) and their correlates within the context of Francoprovençal has provided valuable insights into their distribution patterns. The existing literature primarily focuses on the basic subdivision of Francoprovençal into two types: Francoprovençal A and B (REF).  Studies have shown that the presence of PAs in Francoprovençal A is contingent upon syntactic context, suggesting a dependency on particular structural configurations for their occurrence. However, little attention has been given to understanding these structural factors comprehensively.  In contrast, Francoprovençal B exhibits a more localized distribution pattern for PAs. Specifically, two distinct areas have been identified where singular and plural PAs do not co-occur. One area predominantly displays singular PAs, while in the other area plural PAs are more prevalent.  Additionally, prior research has examined potential correlations between plural marking on nouns and the absence of PAs within these varieties. These investigations have yielded mixed results without establishing any conclusive findings or causal relationships between phonological plurals and PA absence.  Moreover, studies examining overt sigmatic number marking on nouns and its relationship to PA occurrence are limited. Further investigation is required to determine whether such correlations exist in these varieties of Francoprovençal.  While previous research provides a foundation for understanding some aspects of PA distribution within Francoprovençal, there remains a need for a more fine-grained analysis that takes into account various morphosyntactic features as well as spatial factors influencing their presence or absence across different regions.  3. Methodology  To address this gap in knowledge regarding PA distribution within Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy), we conducted extensive fieldwork to collect data from representative speakers residing in these regions.  Our methodology involved eliciting naturalistic speech samples from a diverse group of speakers, capturing variations in lexical choice, syntax, and morphological features pertaining to PAs. Additionally, we conducted targeted interviews with fluent Francoprovençal speakers to elucidate their awareness and usage of these linguistic elements.  The collected data were then transcribed and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative analysis focused on identifying patterns in the distribution of PAs across different syntactic contexts and regions within Francoprovençal A and B.  For quantitative analysis, we developed a mapping technique that allowed us to visualize the spatial distribution patterns of PAs within Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). This involved creating maps that displayed the concentration or absence of PAs in different areas based on data collected during our fieldwork.  4. Findings  In this study, we present several maps illustrating the spatial distribution patterns of PAs within Francoprovençal varieties spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). Our findings offer a more nuanced understanding of PA distribution than previously reported in the literature.  Specifically, our analysis reveals that the presence or absence of PAs is influenced not only by syntactic context but also by specific morphosyntactic features within each subtype of Francoprovençal. In Francoprovençal A, where syntactic factors play a crucial role in determining PA occurrence, our data indicate a more complex pattern than initially described.  Furthermore, we observe distinct regional variations within Francoprovençal B. The two identified areas exhibiting singular or plural PA dominance display clear boundaries where these forms do not overlap. This finding suggests potential dialectal variation or geographical factors influencing linguistic differences between these regions.  Interestingly, our research also finds no correlation between phonologically overt plural marking on nouns and absence/presence of PAs. However, there is evidence indicating a correlation between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns and PA absence.  5. Discussion and Conclusion  The implications of our findings extend beyond the study of Francoprovençal and contribute to broader theoretical discussions within linguistic typology. By exploring the distribution patterns of PAs in Francoprovençal, we shed light on the intricate relationship between morphosyntactic features, spatial factors, and determiner systems in Gallo-Romance languages.  Through this investigation, we advance our understanding of the complex interplay between syntax, semantics, and geography in determining the presence or absence of PAs. This research also serves as a valuable resource for language documentation efforts aimed at preserving endangered varieties like Francoprovençal.  In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of PA distribution within Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal. Our findings challenge previous descriptions by uncovering more nuanced patterns while offering insights into correlations between sigmatic number marking on nouns and PA occurrence/absence. Further research is necessary to expand upon these findings and explore additional linguistic variables that may influence determiner systems within Gallo-Romance languages.",create
"Working memory (WM) is a core function of the cognitive system responsible for holding information briefly available for further processing. It has long been shown that the phonological similarity between items in a to-be-remembered list induces confusion errors (Baddeley, 1966). When participants study lists such as “rat, fat, mat” and are asked to recall them in serial order, they confuse the order of these words more often compared to lists such as “wall, dig, bend”. Semantically similar lists such as “leopard, cheetah, lion”, by contrast, do not reliably lead to such confusion errors compared to semantically dissimilar lists, such as “sky, pen, pillow” . In this work, we comprehensively tested the boundary conditions in which semantic similarity could induce confusion errors. Based on our results, we arrived at the conclusion that semantic and phonological information play different roles in the short-term maintenance of serial/positional information. This study is motivated by models postulating an item’s position in WM is maintained through item-context binding, as implemented in many computational models of serial recall . In these models, serial position is temporarily maintained by binding items – such as words – to contexts – such as a word’s serial position in a list (e.g., binding the word “wall” to “Position 1”). We illustrate this assumption in Fig. 1. Suppose the to-be-remembered sequence is “wall, dig, bend”. If asked to recall the item that was presented in the third position, one can re-activate the context of third position and use it as cue to retrieve the word “bend” that is bound to it (Fig. 1, top). Likewise, if asked to recall where “dig” was presented, one can retrieve “Position 2” (Fig. 1, bottom). The generic associative model in Fig. 1 allows this flexibility: Retrieving an item when cued with a context/position, but also retrieving a context/position when cued with an item. It is this item-context binding that we assume is responsible for maintaining the item’s serial order in a list. This assumption is supported by modelling work that has identified item-context bindings as an essential component of working memory for lists as well as for visual-spatial arrays . It has long been established that the item-context bindings are subject to confusion errors . In the serial-recall literature, these errors are typically referred to as order errors, which is a specific type of confusion error appearing in tasks where people need to recall the items in their serial position of a list. When recalling lists of words in their serial order, people often recall the correct words from the list but in wrong list positions. For instance, when trying to recall the sequence “wall, dig, bend” people sometimes retrieve “wall, bend, dig” instead. These order errors are more likely to occur between items sharing adjacent vs. distant serial positions in the list (i.e., the locality constrain, see [REF]), suggesting some degree of overlap between adjacent positional representations (i.e., the overlapping ellipses in Fig. 2). These confusion errors must be distinguished from item errors, which is the failure to recall an item at all. One might not be able to recall “bend” and either respond with another word that did not exist in the list or leave their response empty. These errors and the way to compute them are illustrated in Fig. 2. Studies have shown a dissociation between confusion and item errors. Confusion errors are more affected by dual-task interference than item errors are , and they are associated with different neural regions . Confusion errors are particularly diagnostic to understand what kind of representations is bound to context, because they reflect failures of distinctly binding each item to its context. We will therefore focus on these errors when examining the role of phonological and semantic representations for the item-context binding process. The role of item memory will be considered in the Discussion. The similarity between to-be-remembered information impacts confusion errors, with similar information being more confusable than dissimilar one. The best studied example of this phenomenon is the phonological similarity effect , in which phonologically similar list items are confused more often than phonologically dissimilar items. This similarity effect is of critical importance for our understanding of WM. It shows that the phonological representation of items is bound to positional contexts. This impact of between-item similarity has been observed across multiple domains, such as the auditory , and visual ones. Therefore, the increased confusability induced by similarity appears to reflect a general property of WM. Confusion errors in WM can be more generally attributed to a discriminability problem. Whatever representation is used during itemcontext binding, this representational format is subject to confusion errors, especially when the to-be-remembered information becomes difficult to discriminate (i.e., as similarity increases).",human
"Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS) is one of the most widespread heritage languages1 in Switzerland. At least 2.4% of the Swiss population speaks BCMS on a daily basis, which corresponds to 173,546 individuals.2 However, the BCMS spoken in Switzerland is still under-investigated, despite the increasing body of research on heritage languages [REF] and on heritage BCMS spoken in other German-speaking countries [REF]. One of the main challenges in the research on heritage varieties is the difficulty in obtaining and redistributing authentic data, which often limits the research settings to case studies based on online communication between peers [REF]. What is particularly lacking for facilitating the research on (BCMS) heritage varieties are corpora of spoken language, since heritage speakers use their heritage language predominantly in oral communication. In order to provide a resource which would enhance the study of heritage BCMS, we created a map task corpus of this variety spoken by second-generation speakers in Switzerland. The corpus consists of data that have been collected by students during the courses “Corpus linguistics” and “BCMS as heritage language in Switzerland” at the Department of Slavonic Languages and Literatures at the University of Zurich in 2019 and 2020. The aim of the exercises was to train the students to conduct an empirical study on spoken language. The task included fieldwork, transcription of speech, linguistic annotation and analysis of selected phenomena found in the collected data. At the end of the courses, we obtained 30 short transcripts and recordings of BCMS heritage speakers having parents born in former Yugoslavia. In order to present this data to a broader audience, and to present a prototype for a corpus access of this type of spoken data, we created an interactive platform on which users can preselect the transcripts according to particular metadata and frequency distribution of pre-annotated features, sort and filter corpus counts, search the annotated turn-aligned transcripts, and add and export their own custom annotations. Hence, in addition to providing a first publicly available resource for heritage BCMS in German-speaking diaspora, with this corpus, we also present an example for visualising, structuring, and accessing spoken language data. With the corpus architecture used for this prototype, we address the need of user-group specific differentiation when accessing spoken language corpora [REF]. The map task corpus of heritage BCMS is primarily tailored for linguists investigating heritage BCMS in interaction, and teachers and learners of BCMS living abroad.  The migration from the countries of former Yugoslavia to Switzerland started in the 1960s, when the name of the official language was Serbo-Croatian. However, Serbo-Croatian as standard language has never been entirely uniform: there was an Eastern and a Western variety, as well as two other (sub-) varieties: Bosnian–Herzegovinian standard-language expression and Montenegrin standard-language expression [REF]. Following the break-up of Yugoslavia, new standard languages have been codified from what was former known as Serbo-Croatian: Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin. All these standard languages are almost completely mutually understandable, since they are all based on the Štokavian dialect, which is spoken in all of these countries.3 While the denomination BCMS is widespread in the linguistic community, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian and Montenegrin are also seen as separate languages, depending on the definition and approach one adopts when dealing with them. There is an extended body of literature about the controversy of BCMS and whether and under which aspects it can be considered one language [REF]. For reasons of consistency, in this paper we use the term BCMS to denominate these language(s), although the variety from Montenegro is not included in our data.",human
"The Insular Celtic languages have often been described as having a ‘sentence word’ [REF], having a strong group accent which leads to individual word losing their ‘phonological autonomy’1 [REF], or even ‘weakly polysynthetic’ [REF]. All these characterisations relate to the fact that, compared with other European languages, the (early) Insular Celtic languages sport a rather large set of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives—including, among others, incorporated adjectives or adverbs [REF]—and a lot of phonological and morpho-phonological interaction between the elements of a phrase. What these broad descriptions usually lack is a set of criteria that define ‘wordhood’ or ‘phonological autonomy’, and a detailed study of the morphological and phonological boundaries, interdependencies and processes that could define a form of ‘word’ in the respective languages. In this, they concur with contemporary native grammars which do not give a definition of wordhood. Early Irish grammars had no concept corresponding to the modern ‘word’, the basic unit of description being the focal which refers to any kind of syntactic group [REF]. The Middle Welsh grammars have even less to say about words: the unit usually equated with the modern concept, a geir, ‘is made out of syllables’ and geireu ‘are the parts of a correct utterance’ [REF]. The last decades of typological research on wordhood have shown that languages may lack a unified word domain, that is a single phonological, morphological and syntactic entity that could unambiguously be called a word—having no or several conflicting domains is possible. Based on current work [REF], this study will provide a detailed investigation of the potential word-like properties of the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose, focusing on the manuscripts of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Poetry will be used to illustrate interesting differences between the two genres or to gain additional insights that cannot be found in prose. The restriction to finite verbal structures is based on Dixon and Aikhenvald's (2002: 14) observation that wordhood patterns may vary between different parts of speech within the same language. The Middle Welsh verbal complex, defined for the purposes of this study as the finite verb and its satellites, as exemplified in (1)2 can contain a variety of more or less grammatical markers, including conjunctions, polarity markers and P- and T-markers. In his particular example, the verbal complex consists of eight markers, starting with a subordinating conjunction can-, followed by a negative marker ny-, an object marker -yand a resultative marker ry-. The lexical root wel- ‘to see’ is then followed by elements familiar from most Indo-European languages, such as a TAM marker -s- and an agreement and TAM marker -ei. The final slot is occupied by a bound pronoun -ef. All of these markers will be discussed in more detail in Section 3. The study is organised into three main parts: Section 2 explains the approach taken in this study, Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 discusses the phonological and prosodic processes that operate inside the verbal complex and how they map onto the morphological structure outlined in Section 3. The final Section 5, sums up and discusses the findings and discusses further possible avenues of study.",human
"Being fluent in more than one foreign language has become a major educational goal in Europe [REF]. However, teaching foreign languages in conjunction with English as a global foreign language seems to pose a challenge, since the simultaneous learning of English is believed to lead to negative interferences with students’ motivation to learn other languages [REF]. This appears to be a general European phenomenon [REF], as cross-sectional research from several countries has repeatedly shown that students usually report lower value beliefs and motivation to learn languages other than English [REF]. Still less is known about longitudinal relations between students’ motivation for several languages. Moreover, the motivational development might not be the same for all students. Previous studies indicate systematic individual differences in students’ motivational beliefs depending, for instance, on their gender, language background [REF], or experience with learning several languages at home [REF]. In order to expand previous research on language motivation, the present study focuses on upper secondary students’ academic language learning in Switzerland, a historically multilingual country. This context provides a unique opportunity to understand how students’ prior linguistic knowledge (e.g., growing up with more than one home language) may be related to their motivation to learn several languages. To explore the longitudinal relationship between students’ motivation for several languages in more depth, this study draws on the concept of value beliefs, which refer to the value students attribute to doing a certain task or activity [REF] and are particularly important for predicting students’ language learning motivation [REF]. First, we investigate the longitudinal relations between Swiss German students’ value beliefs in English (a foreign language), French (a foreign but national language), and German (the native language, as data were obtained in German-speaking Switzerland) from Grades 9 to 11. Second, we explore potential relations between students’ development of value beliefs in the three language subjects and their linguistic background (monolingual vs. multilingual).  Understanding students’ motivation for learning new languages has been a concern of teachers and researchers in psychology and applied linguistics for more than five decades [REF]. The most common motivation models used are the socioeducational model [REF], self-determination theory [REF], the second language (L2) motivational self-system [REF], and expectancy-value theory [REF]. These models have distinct characteristics in describing language motivation but they all share some commonalities, in that they usually differentiate between motivational beliefs arising from within individuals or being influenced from outside (e.g., by parents). For instance, EVT posits that students’ value beliefs (beliefs about the value of engaging in a task) can predict how they will learn [REF]. Some of these value beliefs, such as the intrinsic value (pertaining to personal interest or enjoyment) or the attainment value (pertaining to the personal importance of doing well), share some intrinsic aspects, which are generally argued to be particularly important in language learning [REF]. If students see the value in an activity, they are more likely to engage in learning and to use effective learning strategies [REF]. L2 studies that have included EVT-type constructs indicate that students’ value beliefs play a positive role for their persistence and intention to continue learning a new language [REF] as well as for their achievement [REF]. Regarding the development of value beliefs over time, a large body of EVT-based work has documented an average decline in students’ value beliefs across academic domains, especially throughout late childhood and adolescence [REF]. Moreover, some studies were able to show that longitudinal relations between value facets (e.g., intrinsic and attainment value) differ between academic subjects [REF]. Nonetheless, it is still an understudied issue in educational research whether and how certain value beliefs may also interact with each other over time and across several language subjects.",human
"German-speaking Switzerland’s linguistic situation has been used as a textbook case for outlining ‘diglossia’ [REF]. Specifically, two context-dependent varieties are used; Alemannic (ALM) dialects, commonly referred to as Swiss German1 or Mundart (verbatim ‘mouth kind’), for oral communication, and Swiss Standard German (SSG), also called Schriftdeutsch (verbatim ‘script German’), for written communication. In other words, in German-speaking Switzerland, everyone is a native speaker of a local dialect while SSG is learned at school. To a certain extent, both ALM and SSG can also be used in the other variety’s domain, and Swiss people generally code-switch quite quickly, indicating that we are not dealing with a standard-dialect continuum [REF]. Given this state of affairs, contact between the two varieties is inevitable, so it is not surprising that research has reported interferences on the phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and lexical level for a long time [REF]. Regarding the specific topic of this study, i.e. vowels, there are only four acoustic studies on ALM dialects [REF]. Regarding SSG, vowels have been described in [REF]]; [REF] provided formant charts based on acoustic measurements. Only one study has compared ALM and SSG in Bern, St Gallen, and Zurich [REF]; however, only the SSG vowels were transcribed auditorily. The current study will thus, for the first time, systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties with an instrumental phonetic approach, providing a comparative acoustic analysis of the long vowels produced by the same speakers from Bern (BE), Chur (GR), Brig (VS) and Zurich (ZH).2 In particular, it will analyse to which extent SSG vowel qualities are determined by the speakers’ dialect. After a short description of ALM dialects and the SSG varieties spoken in Germanspeaking Switzerland, each variety’s long vowels will be illustrated, followed by a presentation of the research questions and hypotheses that have guided the current study.  Swiss ALM dialects can be put into three subgroups: Low ALM, which can only be found in the city of Basel, High ALM, comprising the dialects of the northern half, and Highest ALM, spoken in the alpine southern half of German-speaking Switzerland [REF]. As High and Highest ALM make up most of the dialects in Germanspeaking Switzerland, this study will focus on these two. High and Highest ALM are defined by an average of multiple isoglosses that tend to divide German-speaking Switzerland into a northern and southern half. The most famous isogloss is hiatus diphthongisation. The northern half, i.e. High ALM, has developed a diphthong in Old High German (OHG) hiatus positions whereas the southern half, i.e. Highest ALM, maintained a monophthong [REF]. For instance, the ALM equivalents of the standard German verb bauen ‘to build’ are traditionally pronounced with a diphthong as e.g. [»b8ou9.´] in the northern half, and with a monophthong as e.g. [»b8u˘.´] in the southern half. However, either dialect group is not as homogeneous as their names might suggest. Rather, along with the north–south divide, which itself is not a clear divide but a transition zone, there exists also an east–west divide that is based on multiple averaged phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses. For instance, /l/-vocalisation is a phonetic phenomenon that separates the western parts from the eastern parts [REF]. In most of the western parts, /l/ is vocalised to different variants of [u], whereas the east does not have a vocalised realisation of the phoneme /l/.3 Nevertheless, there are many instances where the north–south and east–west divides are not as straightforward. Often, multiple variants exist for a word or a sound. However, those that do show a less complex scattering tend to group in accordance with these two axes. In conclusion, when we overlap these two averaged isogloss divisions, we see that German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions as depicted in Figure 1, not considering Basel (where a Low ALM dialect is spoken) and Samnaun (where a Bavarian dialect is spoken).",human
"Imitation is ubiquitous in humans. It has been argued to be a fundamentally important capacity for human culture [REF] and a developmental basis for language and cognitive skills [REF], representing a powerful learning mechanism for human beings, whether infants or adults. The present study expands on previous research on imitative abilities and investigates the role played by different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation) that have thus far rarely been assessed together. It also contributes to the literature on the imitation abilities of young preschoolers, an age group in whom important linguistic and social developmental advances take place and which has hitherto not been actively studied in the field of imitation abilities. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the relationship between different types of imitation is investigated in relation to linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children. We will start by briefly reviewing the previous literature on the relationship between imitative behaviors and language and sociopragmatic abilities, making the case that language-based imitation should be assessed from a socially relevant multimodal perspective. Imitation skills, understood as the ability to intentionally replicate others’ behaviors or actions, play a fundamental role in the development of language and how it is used in social contexts (i.e., social communication). Numerous empirical and longitudinal studies have shown that spontaneous imitative behaviors which naturally occur in language interactions during the first and second year of life (specifically between 9 and 24 months), as well as elicited imitation behaviors, are key for language production and comprehension [REF], the acquisition of vocabulary [REF], and social communication behaviors such as interactive actions like requesting or greeting [REF]. In relation to language production and comprehension skills, Bates et al. (1979) performed a correlational study with 9- to 13-month-old infants and reported a strong link between vocal imitation (i.e., imitation of sounds and words) and language production and comprehension at this stage of development. Hanika and Boyer (2019) demonstrated that motor imitation behaviors (like clapping hands or pushing a toy car across a table) in infants between 15 and 18 months have a unique relationship to language comprehension skills. In relation to the acquisition of vocabulary, in a study with children from 9 through 15 months, Carpenter et al. (1998) observed a positive relationship between the age when infants began to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects (e.g., hitting the side of a box or patting the top of a box with one hand) and the age when they began to use referential language (i.e., words used to refer to specific actions or objects). Masur and Eichorst (2002) showed that infants that imitated more novel words at 13 months had larger lexicons at 17 months and 21 months, demonstrating that a higher frequency in the imitation of novel words at 13 months predicted infants’ later lexical development. Snow (1989) concluded that vocal and gestural imitation abilities at 14 months were significantly correlated with language skills (i.e., the number of verbs produced or total productive vocabulary) at 20 months. As for the relationship with sociopragmatic skills, Dohmen et al. (2016) carried out a longitudinal study with 29 2-year-old Germanspeaking children identified as late talkers, who were followed up at 4 years of age. The results showed that while early language skills at 2 years were significantly associated with later language outcomes, imitative behaviors made a significant contribution to the prediction of the social communication outcome two years later. Clinically, Dohmen et al.’s study demonstrated that body movement imitation measures have the potential to improve the identification of preschoolers who are at risk of later social communication and language problems. Focusing on non-typically developing populations, the study by Wray, Saunders, McGuire, Cousins and Norbury (2017) revealed that children with language impairment (LI) showed weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitation patterns (i.e., imitation skills in a gesture elicitation task) in comparison to typically developing peers. Additionally, the ability to imitate both words and simple syntactic structures has been shown to be associated with language development in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [REF]. Importantly, the spontaneous or elicited imitative behaviors analyzed in the abovementioned developmental studies encompass both language-based imitation, which includes several language components (e.g., speech vocalizations, body actions, facial expressions, and vocabulary), and object-based imitation (e.g., imitative patterns involving actions on objects observed through play-based activities comprising free-play, book sharing, constructive play, or symbolic play). To our knowledge, only a handful of studies have explicitly compared the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills, suggesting that the former have stronger links to language abilities than objectbased imitation skills [REF]. Stone, Ousley and Littleford’s (1997) study suggested that the imitation of socially relevant body movements and the imitation of actions with objects represented independent dimensions which are not equally related to patterns of language use and language development. In their results, while the imitation of body movements was concurrently and predictively associated with expressive language skills, the imitation of actions on objects was associated with play skills. Masur and Ritz (1984) found that 10- to 16-month-old infants more accurately imitated communicative gestures such as waving or pointing than hand and arm movements with no communicative significance, such as opening and closing of the fist or raising an arm. A similar pattern was reported by Rogers et al. (2003) with regard to facial imitation (e.g., extending the tongue and wiggling it to both sides or making a noisy kiss), with more imitations of facial expressions which were strongly linked to interpersonal social engagement. These findings support the idea that the social function of gestures might be strongly modulating infants’ imitation patterns in a more significant fashion than non-social imitation behaviors. Finally, Ingersoll and Lalonde (2010) analyzed the beneficial role of gesture imitation tasks over object-based imitation tasks in language therapy settings with older children with ASD and found that gesture imitation tasks had a stronger impact. Despite the important contributions made by the abovementioned studies, it is noteworthy that none of them incorporated an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation which includes the gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components. The present study aims to fill in this gap by analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation (understood as the integration between gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical content dimensions) and object-based imitation in a later stage of development (namely, the early preschool years). Although imitative learning behaviors tend to dwindle spontaneously from about 2 years of age, as the child moves into the preschooler stage, imitation continues to be a key component of social communication that promotes shared experiences and social play [REF]. It is thus relevant to ask whether young preschoolers’ abilities to accurately perform the multimodal imitation of socially relevant events are positively correlated with language and sociopragmatic skills. We believe that this is an important developmental period to focus on, because it is when children are delving right into the complex areas of language. When they enter school, they are expected to have certain school readiness skills such as sociopragmatic abilities and basic narration skills, and these skills have been demonstrated to be predictive of important aspects of language and academic development [REF]. In this period, narrative and sociopragmatic skills are thus key in furthering our knowledge about the acquisition of the intersection between social cognition and language [REF]. Summarizing, as previous studies have focused on the relevance of imitation behaviors in early infancy and on children with language disorders, further research is still needed to fully understand the role of socially relevant imitation patterns at the preschool stage. The main hypothesis underlying this investigation is that language-based imitation abilities (crucially regarded as the integration of three separate and complementary dimensions) will be related to both complex language measures (i.e., narration skills) and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers. Several arguments support our proposal that it is crucial to investigate imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective. For a long time, language has been studied primarily as a unichannel phenomenon (i.e., only taking verbal cues into account), skirting over the fact that language is used, learned, and has evolved through face-to-face interactions [REF]. However, numerous studies have provided evidence that speech and gesture are processed similarly in terms of semantic and temporal integration [REF]. Furthermore, there is evidence that prosodic information from visual and vocal channels is processed similarly by the brain [REF], and developmental research shows that prosody and gesture develop together in an intricate relationship [REF]. All in all, the parallel development of multimodal cues (prosody, gesture, and verbal content) and their fine alignment with speech demonstrate the need to assess the value of these multimodal cues together.",human
"Framing is one of the most popular contemporary theoretical approaches in communication research [REF]. Many studies refer to the concept but sometimes fail to provide definitions, resulting in a diversity of phenomena subsumed under this conceptual umbrella [REF]. This complicates attempts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights—which has often been described as a problem for communication research [REF]. Systematic reviews aim to help overcome such problems by identifying common trends, locating research gaps, and guiding future research (e.g., for framing: Borah, 2011; Matthes, 2009). However, the reviews available have not made much use of one of the unique characteristics of the framing approach: its bridging potential [REF]. This relates to the fact that framing is able to consider the entire communication process, with all its aspects, and thus bridges different (interdisciplinary) perspectives: strategic communication by a variety of actors (including their cognitions); journalistic cognitions, processing of information, and subsequent reporting; frames of audiences; framing effects; as well as the broader cultural contexts in which frames emerge and compete for attention [REF]. Entman (1993) refers to frame locations in the communication process: the communicator, the text/message, the receiver, and the culture. Here we argue that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across frame locations and by elucidating the most salient frames at each location, we gain indications about the cultural framing repository—that is, the (competitive) environment of salient and culturally/cognitively available frames [REF]. Reviewing the literature and assessing a cultural framing repository is best performed when selecting one specific topic for which many studies are available. Here we focus on the framing of climate change [REF] for a number of reasons. (1) Since climate change is one of the most important contemporary global problems [REF], exploring its communication is highly relevant. Audiences continue to rely on a set of different sources to obtain information about the issue but nevertheless find the topic difficult to engage with and understand; in this context, frames also affect (the support for) actions audiences are willing to undertake [REF]. Furthermore, climate change is a special topic due to its unobtrusiveness, complexity, and scientific (un)certainty [REF], as well as the required connections between experts, policy, sources of information, and audiences for combating it: framing is able to “break through the communication barriers” (e.g., Nisbet, 2009, p. 15). Certainly, many scholars also share the normative expectation that studying framing helps develop communication strategies (for target audiences), build consensus, and support actions to fight climate change [REF]. To do this effectively, framing needs to be explored across frame locations. (2) Since research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily [REF], future research will benefit from a systematic review. Systematic reviews can take stock and guide future research more thoroughly when many studies are published in a specific field. In climate change communication, research has been conducted on communicator’s frames [REF], journalist’s frames [REF], frame content [REF], as well as audiences frames [REF], and framing effects [REF]—allowing for an assessment across frame locations. (3) There is a limited number of systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall [REF]. Attention should be given to whether common trends observed elsewhere are also evident in framing research on climate change communication. Only then can we assess if there are field-specific applications, which potentially also have implications for studying framing in communication research overall. Indeed, researchers assume that the application of framing varies across subtopics; for instance, there are specific features of framing in health communication [REF]. Fieldspecific insights add to the limited number of studies that systematically examine published literature on framing. Hence, the present study will conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change and compare findings to those from reviews covering framing in communication research overall [REF]. Furthermore, the present study will focus on the most salient frames across frame locations to harness framing’s potential as an integrative bridging concept. Thus, we aim to connect research on frame production (i.e., frames of communicators and journalists), frame content (i.e., the frames most salient in communication), audience frames, and framing effects— which provides indications of the cultural framing repository and allows identification of the conceptual (mis)fit across frame locations. A misfit means that subsequent studies did not identify or relate to the same frames and thus do not contribute to closing the climate change communication cycle [REF]. Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches of content analysis, this study will draw on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing",human
"The diversity of worldviews and knowledge systems held about nature by distinct communities was highlighted by a recent report on values assessment for policymakers, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report [REF]. One approach for exploring variation in knowledge systems is through the lens of language—and in particular by exploring similarities and differences in the ways in which landscapes and their elements are conceptualized through language. Studies of indigenous languages have found differences in conceptualization which can have profound consequences for human–environment relations. These differences often have implications for land cover and land use classes [REF] and their definitions in management. For example, experts erroneously relabeled secondary rainforest as primary assuming rainforest had not previously been cultivated [REF], and classified areas used for grazing as unproductive which led to the planting of forest on what was, in fact, grazing land [REF]. In both cases, differences in terminology relating to landscape—that did not take into consideration indigenous classifications—affected management decisions, with implications for traditional land use. The resulting importance of capturing multiple conceptualizations of our relationship with landscapes for environmental governance has recently gained traction in policy [REF]. Despite this, policy and management approaches often appear to take conceptual equivalence for granted. For example, the European Landscape Convention (Council of Europe, 2000)—which commits signatories to protecting, monitoring, and managing landscapes of all types—has two official languages, English and French, and is then translated into 41 additional languages. It ostensibly assumes straightforward equivalence between languages. However, a closer examination of the term “landscape” and presumed translation equivalents in seven European languages found the superordinate concept landscape may not be so similar across languages after all [REF]. Similarly, other international policy initiatives, such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals [REF], are based around targets and indicators. For example, indicator 15.1.1 aims to measure “Forest area as a proportion of total land area” although in a diverse sample of languages, linguistic terms related to “forest” vary considerably, suggesting that there is no unitary underlying concept (Burenhult et al., 2017; Burenhult, this issue). These differences may be one reason why more formal definitions of “forest”—for instance, based on tree cover and tree height—vary with profound consequences for measurements at global scales [REF]. Related to these issues is a privileging of the English language, and the concepts captured therein, as a dominant language in both science and policy across many countries [REF], especially as the importance of global initiatives increases. This raises a series of important challenges for future work in this area. While previous research has highlighted cross-linguistic differences in isolated concepts, such as “landscape” or “forest,” it remains unclear whether a more systematic exploration of an entire semantic field would also yield such mismatches across languages. It could be the case that researchers have focused specifically on terms which are vague or ill-defined but these are, in fact, the minority when considering the larger vocabulary in this domain. For example, superordinate concepts, such as landscape, are in any case more abstract, and, therefore, potentially less likely to be comparable across languages [REF]. Moreover, studies reporting substantive differences across languages have often focused on case studies based around introspection and dictionary definitions [REF], whereas quantitative corpus-based studies are divided over whether semantic domains related to the physical world (such as landscape) show substantive similarities across languages [REF]. This highlights the need for further empirical study using speaker judgments to clarify the matter. In this paper, we, therefore, examine multiple terms within a single semantic field related to “waterbodies” in two related languages, English and German, with both lay people and experts. Specifically, we explore how speakers mentally represent the domain of “waterbody” terms through sensory, motor, and emotion associations. In doing so, we assume this provides insight into the meaning of these terms, although we remain agnostic for present purposes as to whether the concepts themselves are stored in neural systems for perception and action [REF] or amodal brain regions [REF]. To illustrate, a concept like rainbow is strongly related to visual but not olfactory information; whereas stairs conjure motor movements of the legs, but not mouth. Sensory, motor, and emotion ratings explain language use [REF], and can predict behavioral responses to words [REF]. In the current study, we ask whether terms referring to waterbodies have different sensory, motor, and emotional associations in English and German individually and as a domain. We focus specifically on waterbodies because water is not only essential to life—and thus the subject of a specific Sustainable Development Goal—it is also an important element in many explanations of landscape preference [REF]. For example, Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 6.3.2 aims to improve water quality by monitoring and increasing the “proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality” [REF]. Waterbodies are defined as rivers, lakes, and groundwater, and their technical delineation is described in detail by the United Nations Environment Programme [REF]. Communicating this indicator assumes the public shares a conceptualization of waterbodies, as defined by experts, and this shared conceptualization extends across languages. However, there are reasons to question this. For instance, English lake typically refers to enclosed fresh waterbodies, but the generally accepted equivalent Gaelic word loch encompasses both enclosed waterbodies containing fresh water and those open to the sea. Such differences in meaning have clear implications for the ways in which indicators are understood by local populations, and potentially implemented at national levels. Our investigation targeted English given the central role of English in previous scientific work and policy documents. As a focus of cross-linguistic comparison, we chose German— which although closely related to English (both being Germanic languages of the IndoEuropean family)—has been shown to differ from English with respect to word meanings in a number of other domains [REF]. A further advantage of German is that it is a well-documented language with large corpora available, and it is possible to sample demographically comparable participants to our English sample from the UK. Our German-speaking participants were from Germany and Switzerland and have similar educational and cultural backgrounds to the sample from the UK. Critically, the environmental characteristics of the two regions (UK vs. Germany and Switzerland) differ. The UK is an island surrounded by sea, while most of Germany and Switzerland are landlocked, with rivers playing a more important role for transport. These differences could have implications for conceptual representations. In this study, we also consider the role of expertise and how it may intersect with crosslinguistic differences. Strategic policies around landscape involve experts communicating their knowledge to people with different backgrounds, but expert conceptual representations may differ from lay people in important ways. Previous studies in other domains, such as folk biology, have shown that experts have more alternative knowledge structures to draw upon when making judgments about the structure of a domain [REF]. For example, rather than relying primarily on surface-level perceptual features, experts also use functional information to make judgments. Similarly, studies of wine experts have shown their language use [REF], memory [REF], and imagery [REF] for wines differ from lay people. Together, these studies suggest that experts can have substantively different mental representations than lay people. So, domain-specific knowledge about waterbodies (as exemplified by those knowledgeable in Geography, Geology, or Environmental Science, for example) may differ from lay people. Therefore, we conducted a comparison of expert and lay people’s concepts of waterbodies in order to establish the magnitude of variation across groups. The number of terms which could fall under the rubric “waterbody” is potentially large and may differ in salience between English and German. We, therefore, began with a corpus study (Section 2) in order to identify relevant terms using newspaper corpora in each language and searched for waterbody terms in conjunction with sustainability discourses. Next, the identified terms were submitted to a rating study (Section 3) with naïve and expert participants in English and German in order to test whether the different groups conceptualized waterbodies in distinct manners across sensory, motor, and emotional dimensions. Since we aim to go beyond the potential (non-)equivalence of individual terms, but explore ways in which waterbodies are conceptualized across these dimensions, we used principal component nalysis (PCA) to understand how the waterbody domain is structured within and across languages. From a policy perspective, differences in ways in which the domain as a whole is conceptualized could have implications for the ways in which policy is communicated and implemented.",human
"Reference is ubiquitous in conversation: as speakers interact, they refer to entities relevant to their interaction. A commonly used form of reference is a referring expression with a noun phrase – in its wide variety of forms ranging from pronouns, definite and indefinite descriptions, to proper nouns [REF] – at its centre, here referred to as NP REs. As interlocutors are engaged in interactive communication, some changes can typically be observed in the NP REs they produce over the course of their interaction – what I will call changes-in-interaction.1 Firstly, their contributions generally tend to become more similar, both lexically and in terms of the grammatical constructions employed. This convergence on forms of expression has been argued to be linked with the cognitive process of speakers aligning on their linguistic representations, as outlined by the Interactive Alignment Model [REF], and is well-documented in psycholinguistic research, especially for lexical convergence. It has been proposed that speakers form conceptual pacts in interaction on which they lexically entrain, and that they establish referential precedents [REF]. The second change-in-interaction that has been widely observed in the use of NP REs is that interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions [REF], a phenomenon with has been referred to as “referential contraction” [REF]. The present chapter will predominantly be concerned with this latter process of change-in-interaction – though the two processes generally occur in parallel. In observing the shortening process, this chapter especially aims to describe central trends of structural change-in-interaction in the NP REs produced over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. Specifically, the following research questions are addressed: 1. What is the degree to which speakers’ NP REs (produced in a repeated referential communication task) are shortened over the course of a dialogic interaction? Which elements of the NP REs are subject to shortening? 2. What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task? To investigate change-in-interaction in the use of NP REs, a referential communication task was devised that elicited spoken dialogic conversation over four rounds of interaction, during which interlocutors repeatedly referred to the same sets of visual stimuli. A typical shortening process is illustrated in Example (1), taken from the resulting corpus of spoken interactive dialogue, with the initial first-round NP RE produced for a visual stimulus in (1a) and a selection of subsequent references to that same stimulus in (1b–d). In line with previous research, the initial NP RE in (1a) is longer and gets shortened over the course of the interaction, with interlocutors also converging on a particular NP RE, namely the green dress shirt. The focus of this study is on how speakers, as they converge on forms of expression and shorten their NP REs, change in terms of their preferred grammatical structure for the NP REs they produce. Particularly, the aim is to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction preferred throughout the interaction. Example (1) illustrates a typical trajectory of change observed in the present study: the structure of the NP RE changes from the initial presence of post-head clausal elements (e.g. it’s green) in rounds 1 and 2, to a relatively greater frequency of phrasal (pre-)modification (e.g. green) in rounds 3 and 4. These changes are indicative of what Biber and Clark (2002) have termed “compression”; this term is used to cover both the shortening process as well as the changes in structural preferences described above along the trajectory from clausal to phrasal elements. In Section 2, previous research on change-in-interaction – especially on changes relating to compression in NP REs – is discussed. The findings from experimental referential communication task studies are contextualised in theoretical approaches relating to the production of NP REs, namely the IAM [REF] and discussions of familiarity and accessibility [REF]. Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up employed to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues. Based on this corpus, an analysis of the structural changes in NP REs over the course of the dialogical interactions is presented in Section 4. The analysis shows that as NP REs get shortened – particularly in terms of the length of post-head elements – their structure changes from initially more elaborated, clausal forms, to more compressed, phrasal forms in later rounds of interaction. In Section 5, these findings are discussed with regard to Biber and Clark’s (2002) notion of compression as a change that occurs in reaction to a demand for a large amount of information to be conveyed to an expert audience, allowing language users to be more efficient.",human
"Francoprovençal is a non-standardized and highly endangered Gallo-Romance language spoken today by about 110,000 to 160,000 speakers in France, Switzerland, and Italy [REF]. It was never the official language of an administrative entity and never saw standardization. Nowadays, all speakers of Francoprovençal are bilingual, and for Swiss varieties, most of them are older than 70 years, with the notable exception of Evolène in the canton Valais in Switzerland where the local variety of Francoprovençal is still transmitted to the next generation [REF]. In the Aosta Valley, in Italy, due to successful language policy promoting the use of Francoprovençal, we also still find competent native speakers of all ages. Not only geographically, but also typologically, Francoprovençal can be considered a ‘bridge’ between French, Occitan and Italian dialects, but it is relatively underresearched in terms of its morphological or syntactic properties (but see e.g., Diémoz 2007 for subject pronouns and subsequent publications). Since 2018, a binational project focusing on so-called ‘partitive articles’ (henceforth PA) in Francoprovençal varieties and Northern Italian Dialects (NIDs) has contributed to a better understanding of the nominal morphosyntax of Francoprovençal varieties. In an important antecedent study to this project, Kristol [REF] has already shown a subdivision of French, Swiss and Italian varieties into two types according to their determiner systems: “Francoprovençal A”, which comprises the Western varieties of the Valais (Switzerland) and the Northern varieties (in France and Switzerland), and “Francoprovençal B”, which comprises Southern Francoprovençal, that is, the Southern varieties spoken in France, the Eastern varieties in the Swiss canton of Valais and the Aosta Valley in Italy. Francoprovençal A varieties have a gender distinction on plural definite articles (masc. lu(z)—fem. le(z)), like in Ibero-Romance systems, and they possess a fully-fledged PA, like French [REF]. In contrast to French, however, PAs in Francoprovençal A are also attested after quantifiers/quantity expressions like Fr. beaucoup ‘a lot’ and under the scope of sentential negation [REF]. Francoprovençal B varieties do not show, like French and unlike Italian, any gender distinction on the plural definite article (le(z), with a sort of liaison consonant [z] realized only in front of vocalic onsets of the following word); correlated with this morphology, these varieties only have an obligatory [REF] invariable DE for indefinite mass singulars and indefinite plurals (with an optional allomorph de-[z] in the plural before vocalic onset). In addition, definite articles in some localities of the Francoprovençal B area (e.g., eastern Valais, Switzerland) exhibit the remains of an older subject vs oblique case system when they are singular, as illustrated in Table 1 [REF]. In sum, the two main types of Francoprovençal are different with respect to some main features of the nominal domain (see Table 1). This paper focuses on the first property, illustrated in (1) and (2), where the nouns kwəˈzən ‘cousins’ and te ‘tea’ are preceded by a PA and the invariable DE, respectively:",human
